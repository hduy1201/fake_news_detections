8155,"Walmart has removed an item from its website and issued an apology on Monday after the product description was found to contain the N-word.  The merchandise, a weaving net used for hair extensions retailed under the brand Jagazi Naturals, was being sold by a third party on Walmart.com for $7.28.  The title of the item read, in part: 'Durable Stretchy Weaving Net Weaving Cap Wig Cap Size M (N*****-brown).'  Scroll down for video  Twitter user Kwani Lunis came upon this offensive product description for a weaving cap on Walmart's website  The racist term also caught the attention of comedy writer Travon Free, who quipped that he and Walmart should 'have a chat'  The offensive term was also repeated in the description section beneath a photo showing a mannequin with the brown, lacy cap on its head.  Online user Kwani Lunis came upon the racial slur online and alerted Walmart, tweeting: 'Hey @Walmart what are you doing.'  Comedian Travon Free, who is African-American and works as a staff writer on TBS' Full Frontal with Samanta Bee, weighed in on the controversy, quipping in a tweet that he and Walmart should 'have a chat.'  By Monday, as outrage over the slur spread on social media, the weave cap had been removed and the big-box retailer apologized on its Tweeter account, writing: ‘We agree, this is appalling.’  The company also issued a statement laying the blame on the third-party retailer.  Writer and commentator Roxane Gay also weighed in on the controversy on Twitter  So sorry: Walmart later removed the item from its website and issued an apology  ‘We are very sorry and appalled that third party seller listed their item with this description on our online marketplace. It is a clear violation of our policy and has been removed, and we are investigating the seller to determine how this could have happened.’  By late afternoon, the weaving net was still available for purchase in black on Walmart’s website.  Meanwhile, Jagazi Naturals, a company based out of London and run by CEO Chizo Onuh, who is originally from Nigeria, posted a statement on its website addressing the flap over the wig cap and claiming that someone had hijacked their brand to hawk a fake version of their weave net.  'We woke up this morning to the news that someone has used our name JAGAZI to list an item,' the message read. 'Please beware that we are reporting this to as many people as we can and trying to get all the listings pulled down.  'The real JAGAZI is a 100% black company for black people. People have often used our brand name to try and sell their fake products. Please be aware. Very sorry for all the distress this has caused. We are feeling the pain here as well. Most shocking!'  The weaving net controversy comes just days after Walmart Canada came under fire and was forced to pull from its shelves a 'racist' onesie decorated with teepees that joked about children living at home despite the country's history of taking indigenous kids away from their families.",real

For other uses, see Bieber (disambiguation)  Canadian singer, songwriter, and actor  Justin Drew Bieber ( ; born March 1, 1994) is a Canadian singer, songwriter, and actor.[4] Discovered at 13 years old by talent manager Scooter Braun after he had watched his YouTube cover song videos, Bieber was signed to RBMG Records in 2008. With Bieber's debut EP My World, released in late 2009, Bieber became the first artist to have seven songs from a debut record chart on the Billboard Hot 100.[5]  Bieber released his debut studio album My World 2.0 in 2010. Containing the hit single ""Baby"", the album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, making Bieber the youngest solo male act to top the chart in 47 years.[6] Following his debut album and promotional tours, he released his 3D biopic-concert film Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, which was a box office success. In the years after the releases of the Under the Mistletoe (2011) and Believe (2012), Bieber had established himself as a teen idol, but faced several controversies, including run-ins with the law internationally before his first arrest in 2014.[7]  Following the controversies surrounding Bieber, his sound became more mature as he transitioned into EDM and moved away from teen pop.[8] Released in 2015, his fourth studio album Purpose became his most commercially successful album, spawning three Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles: ""What Do You Mean?"", ""Sorry"", and ""Love Yourself"". After the release of Purpose, Bieber had featured on several successful collaborations, including ""Cold Water"", ""Let Me Love You"", ""Despacito (Remix)"", ""I'm the One"", ""I Don't Care"" and ""10,000 Hours"". After taking some time off to refocus on his marriage to American model Hailey Baldwin, Bieber returned with solo material in 2020 with the release of his fifth studio album, Changes.[9]  Bieber has sold more than 150 million records, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists.[10][11] He has won numerous awards, including a Grammy Award, 15 American Music Awards, 20 Billboard Music Awards, two Brit Awards, a Latin Grammy Award, a record 21 MTV Europe Music Awards, and three MTV Video Music Awards.[12] Time magazine included Bieber in their 2011 edition of the 100 most influential people in the world list. He was included by Forbes list of the top ten most powerful celebrities in the world, in 2011, 2012 and 2013.[13] In 2016, Bieber became the first artist to surpass 10 billion total video views on Vevo.[14]  Early life  Bieber was born on March 1, 1994, in London, Ontario, at St Joseph's Hospital,[15] and was raised in Stratford, Ontario.[16] He is the only child of Jeremy Jack Bieber and Pattie Mallette, who were never married.[17] Mallette was underage when she gave birth, and her mother Diane and stepfather Bruce helped her raise her son.[18] Bieber's ancestry includes French-Canadian, Irish, English, Scottish, and German.[20][21] He has also stated that he has some undetermined Aboriginal Canadian ancestry.[22]  Through his father Jeremy, Bieber has three younger half-siblings. Jeremy and his ex-girlfriend Erin Wagner, who broke up in 2014 after seven years together, have two children, daughter Jazmyn and son Jaxon.[23] Jeremy married his girlfriend Chelsey in February 2018, and they have a daughter named Bay.[24][25] Bieber also has a stepsister named Allie, the daughter of his stepmother.[26] Pattie worked a series of low-paying office jobs, raising Bieber as a single mother in low-income housing. Bieber has maintained contact with his father.[27]  Bieber attended a French-language immersion elementary school in Stratford, the Jeanne Sauvé Catholic School.[18] Growing up, he learned to play the piano, drums, guitar, and trumpet.[16][28] He graduated from high school in Stratford, Ontario, the St. Michael Catholic Secondary School in 2012[29] with a 4.0 GPA.[30] In early 2007, aged 12, Bieber sang Ne-Yo's ""So Sick"" for a local singing competition in Stratford and was placed second.[28][31] Mallette posted a video of the performance on YouTube for their family and friends to see. She continued to upload videos of Bieber singing covers of various R&B songs, and Bieber's popularity on the site grew.[32] In the same year, Bieber busked shows in front of Avon Theatre steps during tourism season.  Career  2008–2009: Career beginnings and My World  When searching for videos of a different singer, Scooter Braun, a former marketing executive of So So Def Recordings, clicked on one of Bieber's 2007 YouTube videos by accident.[27] Impressed, Braun tracked down the theatre Bieber was performing in, located Bieber's school, and finally contacted Mallette, who was reluctant because of Braun's Judaism. She remembered praying, ""God, I gave him to you. You could send me a Christian man, a Christian label!"", and, ""God, you don't want this Jewish kid to be Justin's man, do you?"" However, church elders convinced her to let Bieber go with Braun. At 13, Bieber went to Atlanta, Georgia, with Braun to record demo tapes.[27] Bieber began singing for Usher one week later.[33]  Bieber in 2010, displaying his trademark earlier haircut  Bieber was soon signed to Raymond Braun Media Group (RBMG), a joint venture between Braun and Usher.[34] Justin Timberlake was also reportedly in the running to sign Bieber but lost the bidding war to Usher.[34][35]  Bieber at a signing event in 2009  Usher then sought assistance in finding a label home for the artist from then manager Chris Hicks, who helped engineer an audition with his contact L.A. Reid of The Island Def Jam Music Group.[36] Reid signed Bieber to Island Records in October 2008 (resulting in a joint venture between RBMG and Island Records) and appointed Hicks as executive Vice-President of Def Jam, where he could manage Bieber's career at the label.[3][32][34][36] Bieber then moved to Atlanta with his mother to pursue further work with Braun and Usher.[34] Braun became Bieber's manager in 2008.[32]  Bieber's first single, ""One Time"", was released to radio while Bieber was still recording his debut album.[37] The song reached number 12 on the Canadian Hot 100 during its first week of release in July 2009[32] and later peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. During fall 2009, it had success in international markets.[38] The song was certified platinum in Canada and the US and gold in Australia and New Zealand.[39][40][41] His first release, an extended play entitled My World, was released on November 17, 2009. The album's second single, ""One Less Lonely Girl"", and two promo singles, ""Love Me"" and ""Favorite Girl"", were released exclusively on the iTunes Store and charted within the top 40 of the US Billboard Hot 100.[38]  ""One Less Lonely Girl"" was later also released to radio and peaked within the top 20 in Canada and the US, and was certified gold in the latter.[38] My World was eventually certified platinum in the US and double platinum in both Canada and the United Kingdom.[42][43] To promote the album, Bieber performed on several live shows such as mtvU's VMA 09 Tour, European program The Dome, YTV's The Next Star, The Today Show,[44][45] The Wendy Williams Show, Lopez Tonight, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, It's On with Alexa Chung, Good Morning America, Chelsea Lately, and BET's 106 & Park.

He was invited to be a vocalist for the remake of ""We Are the World"" (a song written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie) for its 25th anniversary to benefit Haiti after the earthquake. Bieber sings the opening line, which was sung by Lionel Richie in the original version.[49]  On March 12, 2010, a version of K'naan's ""Wavin' Flag"", recorded by a collective of Canadian musicians known as Young Artists for Haiti, was released. Bieber is featured in the song, performing the closing lines.  In January 2010, ""Baby"", was released from his debut album, My World 2.0. The song featured Ludacris, and became an international hit. It charted at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaked at number three on the Canadian Hot 100[51] and reached the top ten in several international markets.[38] Two promo singles ""Never Let You Go"", and ""U Smile"" were top thirty hits on the US Hot 100, and top twenty hits in Canada.[38] According to review aggregator Metacritic, the album has received generally favourable reviews.[52] It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, making Bieber the youngest solo male act to top the chart since Stevie Wonder in 1963.[6] My World 2.0 also debuted at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, Irish Albums Chart, Australian Albums Chart, and the New Zealand Albums Chart[38] and reached the top ten of fifteen other countries.[53][54]  To promote the album, Bieber appeared on several live programs including The View, the 2010 Kids' Choice Awards, Nightline, Late Show with David Letterman, The Dome and 106 & Park.[55] Sean Kingston appeared on the album's next single, ""Eenie Meenie"".

In May 2010, Bieber featured in Soulja Boy's song ""Rich Girl"".[58] In July 2010, it was reported that Bieber was the most searched-for celebrity on the Internet.[59] That same month, his music video for ""Baby"" surpassed Lady Gaga's ""Bad Romance"" (2009) as the most viewed, and also the most disliked, YouTube video ever.[60][61] However, Taylor Swift's video for her single ""Blank Space"" (2014) surpassed its number of views in 2015.[62] In September 2010, it was reported that Bieber accounted for 3% of all traffic on Twitter, according to an employee of the social-networking site.[63]  On My World 2.0, Bieber's voice was noted to be deeper than it was in his debut EP, due to puberty.[64] In April 2010, the singer remarked regarding his vocals: ""It cracks. Like every teenage boy, I'm dealing with it and I have the best vocal coach in the world ... Some of the notes I hit on ""Baby"" I can't hit any more. We have to lower the key when I sing live.""[65] Bieber guest-starred in the season premiere of the CBS American crime drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, which aired on September 23, 2010. He played a ""troubled teen who is faced with a difficult decision regarding his only brother"", who is also a serial bomber.

Chu. It topped the box office with an estimated gross of $12.4 million on its opening day from 3,105 theatres.[70] It grossed $30.3 million for the weekend and was narrowly beaten by the romantic comedy Just Go with It, which grossed $31 million.[71] Never Say Never reportedly exceeded industry expectations, nearly matching the $31.1 million grossed by Miley Cyrus's 2008 3-D concert film, Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert, which holds the record for the top debut for a music-documentary.[72] Never Say Never grossed a total of $98,441,954 worldwide.[73] The film is accompanied by his second remix album, Never Say Never – The Remixes, released February 14, 2011, and features remixes of songs from his debut album, with guest appearances from Miley Cyrus, Chris Brown, and Kanye West, among others.[74] One song from the album, ""That Should Be Me (remix)"", featured with American country band Rascal Flatts, won him his first award in country music for Collaborative Video of the Year in CMT Music Awards in June 2011. Time magazine named Bieber one of the 100 most influential people in the world on their annual list.[75] In June 2011, Bieber was ranked No. 2 on the Forbes list of Best-Paid Celebrities under 30. He is the youngest star, and 1 of 7 musicians on the list, having raked in $53 million in a 12-month period.[76] The same month, his collaborative single ""Next to You"" with American singer Chris Brown has released. The unfinished video for that song was leaked online on June 6, and the official video was released on June 17. On November 1, 2011, Bieber released the Christmas-themed Under the Mistletoe, his second studio album. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, selling 210,000 copies in its first week of release.[77] The first single from the album, ""Mistletoe"" peaked at number one on the US Billboard Holiday Digital Songs chart.[78] Bieber re-recorded Mariah Carey's single ""All I Want For Christmas Is You"" with Carey as well for the album.[79]  2012–2014: Believe, Journals, and other appearances  In late 2011, Bieber began recording his third studio album, entitled Believe. The following week, Bieber appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to announce that the first single would be called ""Boyfriend"" and would be released on March 26, 2012.[80] The song debuted at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, selling a total of 521,000 digital units, the second-highest-ever debut digital sales week.[81] Bill Werde of Billboard noted that it failed to debut at number one because the digital download of the track was available only through iTunes Store, ""restricting the buying option for those [who] do not frequent the Apple retail store"".[82] ""Boyfriend"" became Bieber's first single ever to reach the top position on the Canadian Hot 100 by debuting at number one and staying on for one week.[81] Bieber featured in American hip hop group Far East Movement's song ""Live My Life"", from their fourth studio album Dirty Bass, in February 2012. The song emerged online five days before its scheduled release date and peaked within the top thirty of the Billboard Hot 100.[83] First promotional single from the album, ""Die in Your Arms"" was released on May 29, 2012 and second promotional single, ""All Around the World"" featured with American rapper Ludacris followed the next week.[84][85] The second single from Believe, ""As Long as You Love Me"" featured with rapper Big Sean was released on June 11, 2012. It peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100.[86]  His third studio album, Believe was released on June 19, 2012, by Island Records. The album marked a musical departure from the teen pop sound of his previous releases, and incorporated elements of dance-pop and R&B genres.[87] Intent on developing a more ""mature"" sound, Bieber collaborated with a wide range of urban producers for the release as well as some long-time collaborators, including Darkchild, Hit-Boy, Diplo, and Max Martin. Entertainment Weekly praised Bieber's musical shift, calling the album both a ""reinvention and a reintroduction"".[88] Rolling Stone noted the deeper voice and more ""intense"" beats found on the album, although it lampooned one of his euphemisms for newfound sexual maturity (""If you spread your wings, you can fly away with me"").[89] Believe debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, becoming his fourth number-one album.[90][91][92] The album sold 57,000 copies in its first week in Canada, debuting atop the Canadian Albums Chart.[93] In September 2012, Bieber was featured on ""Beautiful"", a song from Carly Rae Jepsen's second studio album, Kiss (2012).[94] In October 2012, the third single from Believe, ""Beauty and a Beat"" featuring rapper Nicki Minaj, was released.

His appearance was panned by critics[98][99] and cast members, including Kate McKinnon, who said Bieber was not comfortable with his hosting duties, and Bill Hader, who said he did not enjoy the presence of Bieber or his entourage. Hader added that in his eight years on the television program, Bieber was the only host who lived up to his reputation.[100][101]  On March 7, 2013, Bieber fainted backstage at London's O2 Arena after complaining of breathing problems throughout his concert performance and was taken to the hospital.[102] Bieber cancelled his second Lisbon, Portugal concert at the Pavilhão Atlântico, which was to be held on March 12, because of low ticket sales. The concert held in the same venue on March 11 did go on as scheduled.[103] In mid-August 2013, a remixed duet version of Michael Jackson's previously unreleased song ""Slave to the Rhythm"", featuring Bieber, leaked online.[104] In response to criticism over this remix, the Michael Jackson Estate stated that it had not authorized the release of this recording, and has since made attempts to remove the song from as many web sites and YouTube channels as possible.[105] Later, a song titled ""Twerk"" by rapper Lil Twist, featuring Bieber as well as Miley Cyrus, also leaked.[106] In September, Bieber was featured in Maejor Ali's song ""Lolly"" with rapper Juicy J.[107] A music video for ""Melodies"", the debut single of American singer Madison Beer, was released in the same month featuring Bieber in a cameo appearance.[108]  On October 3, 2013, Bieber announced that he would release a new song every Monday for 10 weeks as a lead-up to the film Justin Bieber's Believe, which entered production in May 2012 and was released on December 25, 2013.

The song was Bieber's first release of 2017 and the first in which he sings in Spanish.[134] The remix boosted the original song to the Hot 100's Top 10, being the first mostly Spanish language top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 since Macarena in 1996.[135] The remix is the most viewed song of all time on the crowdsourced media knowledge base Genius, with 21.2 million views.[136]  Bieber, along with rappers Quavo, Chance the Rapper, and Lil Wayne, provided vocals on DJ Khaled's single ""I'm the One"", released on April 28, 2017. The song debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Bieber's second number-one debut and his fourth song to top the chart.[137] One week later, ""Despacito"" topped the charts in the US, making the single the first mostly Spanish-language Hot 100 No. 1 in more than 20 years, becoming his fifth number one single and it made Bieber the first artist ever to notch new No. 1s in back-to-back weeks.[138] On June 9, 2017, French DJ David Guetta's single ""2U"", in which Bieber was featured, was released. The first music video for ""2U"" features Victoria's Secret models lip synching to the song.[139][140][141]  On August 17, 2017, Bieber released the single ""Friends"" with American record producer and songwriter BloodPop. Songwriters Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter reunited with Bieber to construct the song, just as they helped create his single ""Sorry"" in 2015 on his studio album Purpose.[142] Bieber did not attend the 2018 Grammy Awards Show to perform the nominated song ""Despacito"", claiming that he would not make any award show appearances until his next album was finished.[143] In July 2018, Bieber reunited with DJ Khaled in ""No Brainer"", co-featuring again with Chance the Rapper and Quavo. He also featured in the accompanying music video.[144]  2019–present: Return and Changes  On March 25, 2019, Bieber announced through Instagram that he will be taking a break from music to fix ""deep rooted issues"" that he has been dealing with.[145] However, he later announced that a fifth studio album was forthcoming at the 2019 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.  On May 10, 2019, British singer Ed Sheeran and Bieber released the single ""I Don’t Care"", from Sheeran's album No.6 Collaborations Project (2019). The pair had previously collaborated, with Sheeran co-writing Bieber's 2015 song ""Love Yourself"", and Major Lazer's 2016 song ""Cold Water"", which featured Bieber. ""I Don't Care"" became a worldwide hit, reaching number-one in 26 countries, while peaking at number 2 in the United States.[146] Bieber later featured on a remix of Billie Eilish's breakthrough single ""Bad Guy"", which was released on July 11.[147] On October 4, 2019, Bieber and country music duo Dan + Shay released the song ""10,000 Hours"",[148] debuting at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100.[149]  On December 24, 2019, Bieber announced that he would be releasing his fifth studio album and embarking on his fourth concert tour in 2020.[150] The album's first single, ""Yummy"", was released on January 3, 2020. It debuted at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[151] On December 31, 2019, Bieber also released a trailer announcing his 10-episode YouTube Originals documentary series Seasons, which will appear in episodes on Mondays and Wednesdays, starting on January 27, 2020.[152] Appearing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on January 28, 2020, Bieber finally confirmed the release date of his fifth studio album, Changes, to be February 14, 2020.[153] The same day, he also released a promotional single for the album, ""Get Me"", featuring singer Kehlani.[154] On February 7, Bieber released ""Intentions"" (featuring Quavo) as the second single from the album.[155] It reached number five on the Billboard Hot 100.[156][151] Changes was released on February 14, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200, his seventh US number-one album.[157]  On January 27, 2020, at the premier of Bieber's Seasons documentary series, Bieber announced a new single, ""La Bomba"", featuring Colombian singer J Balvin, in which Bieber would sing in both English and Spanish.[158][159] On February 28, 2020, a clip of the music video shoot was leaked which included a portion of the song.[160] On May 8, 2020 American singer Ariana Grande and Bieber released the single ""Stuck with U"".[161]  Artistry  Musical style  Bieber has credited musicians such as Michael Jackson as his biggest influence  Bieber's music is mainly pop and R&B.[162] In 2010, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone asserted that the content of his music was ""offering a gentle introduction to the mysteries and heartaches of adolescence: songs flushed with romance but notably free of sex itself"".[163] In January 2012, Bieber told V magazine that he doesn't want to sing about sex, drugs and swearing. He stated ""I want to do it at my own pace. I don't want to start singing about things like sex, drugs and swearing. I'm into love, and maybe I'll get more into making love when I'm older. But I want to be someone who is respected by everybody.""[164] But since then, Bieber gradually altered his artistry, with Peter Gicas of E! Online describing ""PYD"" as ""sexed-up"", while In Touch Weekly magazine describing his song with Maejor Ali and Juicy J ""Lolly"" might make his fans a bit uncomfortable because of its lyrics.[165][107] After his hit in 2015 on Jack Ü's track ""Where Are Ü Now"", Bieber released the EDM-fuelled album Purpose a collaboration with Diplo, DJ Snake and Major Lazer.[166]  Influences  Bieber has cited Michael Jackson, The Beatles, Boyz II Men, Mariah Carey, Justin Timberlake, Stevie Wonder, Tupac, and Usher as his musical inspirations.[167][168][169] Believe was influenced by Timberlake, for which Bieber was trying to ""create a new sound that people aren't really used to hearing ... like when [Timberlake] did FutureSex/LoveSounds: It was a new sound… acoustic guitar over hard drums.""[170]  Voice  Bieber initially sang with a boy soprano voice,[171] before his voice broke, as was evidenced during a performance of ""Pray"" at the 2010 American Music Awards. Sean Michaels of The Guardian described puberty as ""the biggest threat to his career"" at the time.[172] Jody Rosen commented that Bieber sings with ""swing and rhythmic dexterity"" on his debut album, noting his tone to be ""nasal"".[163]  Bieber started to receive voice coaching from Jan Smith in 2008.[173]  As an adult singer, Bieber's voice type is tenor, with a vocal range spanning from the baritone A (A2) to the high tenor F (F5).[174][175] In a review of his Purpose album, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph complimented his ""soft, supple and seductive singing.""[176] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian also praised Bieber's ""affectedly breathy voice"", noting that ""the voice soon palls, but the songs are often interesting.""[177]  Business ventures and endorsements  In 2010 Bieber signed a deal with Proactiv.[178] In the same year, Bieber partnered with Nicole by OPI to launch a nail polish line ""The One Less Lonely Girl Collection"", which sold exclusively in Walmart.[179] Bieber's nail polish line sold one million bottles less than two months after its release.[180] Bieber endorsed Adidas, beside Derrick Rose and Venus Williams, in 2012.[181] He became the new ""face"" and ""body"" of Calvin Klein in early 2015.[182] In June 2015, Bieber teamed up with StarShop, a new shopping app launched by Kevin Harrington.[183] In January 2015, Entertainment Tonight reported that entertainer Justin Bieber had used MYO-X, a dietary supplement, in preparation for a Calvin Klein underwear photo shoot.[184] Bieber was criticized for ""... hyping the latest 'miracle' supplement MYO-X, to his 59 million Twitter fans.""[185] Bieber endorses Beats By Dre, Elizabeth Arden and Best Buy.[186][187] Bieber has been credited with boosting the careers of other singers such as Carly Rae Jepsen and Madison Beer when he tweeted about them.[188][189]  He has bandwagoned four fragrances as of 2014.[190] He launched his debut fragrance, Someday, in 2011;[190] it grossed more than three million US dollars in sales, at Macy's, in just under three weeks, which industry experts regard as a successful celebrity-led launch.[191] On the heels of that 2011 best-seller, he launched his second fragrance, Girlfriend, in June 2012.[192] His third fragrance, The Key, was launched in July 2013,[193] and his latest fragrance, Justin Bieber Collector's Edition, launched in 2014. In September 2019, after a year long collaboration with Schmidt's Naturals CEO, Michael Cammarata, Bieber released his deodorant line, ""Here +Now.""[194][195][196]  Public image  General  Bieber performing in Zürich , 2011  Bieber has been referred to as the ""Prince of Pop""[197] and ""King of Teen Pop""[198] by contemporary journalists. Usher commented that while he and Bieber were both signed at the same age, ""I had the chance to ramp up my success, where this has happened to Bieber abruptly"". As a result, when he was younger, Usher, Braun, Bieber's bodyguard, and other adults surrounding Bieber constantly coached him on handling fame and his public image.[27] After signing Bieber, Usher appointed one of his former assistants, Ryan Good, to be Bieber's road manager and stylist. Good, once nicknamed Bieber's ""swagger coach"", created a ""streetwise look"" for the singer which consisted of baseball caps, hoodies, dog chains, and flashy sneakers. Amy Kaufman of The Los Angeles Times comments, ""Though a product of a middle-class suburban upbringing in Stratford, Ontario, Bieber's manner of dress and speech ('Wassup man, how you doin'?' or 'It's like, you know, whateva' ') suggest he's mimicking his favourite rappers.""[199] In 2013, Bieber said he was ""very influenced by black culture"", but he neither thought ""of it as black or white"" nor tried to ""act or pose in a certain way"". To him, it was ""a lifestyle—like a suaveness or a swag"".[200] Wax statues of him with the hairstyle from his earlier career are on display at the Madame Tussauds wax museums in Amsterdam, London, and New York City.[201]  He's the only person in humanity who's grown up the way he has – with smartphones and cameras on him 24/7 ... Another kid can go out and have a good night on the town, and no one gives a crap, but Justin is the most Googled person on the planet – for four years straight! —Scooter Braun, Bieber's manager, in 2013[200]  Bieber was often featured in teen magazines, such as Tiger Beat,[27] and has been labelled as a ""teen heartthrob"".[202] In 2010, he was frequently criticized for looking and sounding younger than his age,[203] and the following year for an androgynous appearance, which had been commonly noted in the media, including his appearance on the cover of LOVE magazine's androgyny issue in 2011.[204] His teen-pop music, image (especially as a heartthrob to girls), and the media attention he receives have additionally been criticized.[203] He has been a target of Internet bloggers and message board posters, especially users of the Internet message board 4chan and of YouTube.[205] Nick Collins of The Daily Telegraph said that ""Bieber's character appears to strike a particularly sour note with his Internet critics"" who have questioned his manner of speech, among other things.[203]  In his later years, especially after his marriage in 2018, Bieber's persona changed. As his fan base got older and he got married, Bieber transitioned away from the teenage heartthrob image, taking on a more mature personality and a more soft-spoken style of speech.[206][207] In an interview with Vogue in February 2019, Bieber said that he would ""laugh at his past self"".[208]  Bieber's early fanbase developed on YouTube and predated the release of his debut album My World.[209] According to Jan Hoffman of The New York Times, part of Bieber's appeal stems from his YouTube channel. Chicago Tribune noted that Bieber's fanbase, ""Beliebers"", was among the top words of 2010.[210] Long before the November 2009 release of My World, his YouTube videos attracted millions of views.[27] Braun recognized the appeal. Before flying him to Atlanta, Braun wanted to ""build him up more on YouTube first"" and had Bieber record more home videos for the channel. ""I said: 'Justin, sing like there's no one in the room. But let's not use expensive cameras.' We'll give it to kids, let them do the work, so that they feel like it's theirs"", recalled Braun.[27] Bieber continues to upload videos to the same channel and has opened a Twitter account, from which he interacts with fans regularly;[32] his account was reported to have more than six million followers in November 2010.[211] Bieber surpassed Lady Gaga for being the most followed person on Twitter in January 2013. In early November 2013, Katy Perry surpassed him for having the most followers.[212]  As of 2017, Bieber was the second most followed user of Twitter, while his VEVO channel made him the third most subscribed user of YouTube until by 2018 where it became the second most subscribed user of YouTube. The music video for Bieber's song ""Baby"" is the second most disliked on YouTube, receiving over 9.93 million dislikes since its upload in 2010, being only surpassed by the 2018 YouTube Rewind in December 2018.[213] Guinness Book of World Records listed ""Baby"" as the most disliked video on YouTube and on the Internet as of 2013[214] and six of Bieber's music videos (more than any other artist) listed in the top 40 most disliked videos on YouTube.[215] Bieber was frequently a trending topic on Twitter when the feature first launched[216] because his fans frequently discussed him on the network,[217] and he was named the top trending star on Twitter in 2010;[218] Klout gave his account a score of 100.[219][220] In April 2013, the social media analysis company Socialbakers concluded that 16.7 million of Bieber's 37 million Twitter followers were not genuine.[221][222]  Personal life  As Bieber resides in the United States, he is reported to possess an O-1 visa for temporary resident status, based on ""extraordinary ability or achievement"" in a field.[223] Bieber has said he is not interested in obtaining US citizenship, and has praised Canada as being ""the best country in the world"", citing its mostly government-funded health care system as a model example.[224] However, in September 2018, TMZ reported that Bieber had begun the process of becoming an American citizen, following his marriage to Hailey Baldwin.[225]  Relationships  Bieber's father, Jeremy Bieber, is a former carpenter and pro-am mixed martial artist. In March 2014, Rolling Stone characterized Jeremy as having ""split with Justin's mom when Justin was a toddler, and wasn't always around afterward. But he has, as of late, accepted a place of honor in his superstar son's entourage"".[226]  In December 2010, Bieber began dating Selena Gomez.[227] After initially splitting in November 2012, they had an on-again, off-again relationship until March 2018.[228][229][230] On an interview during The Ellen Show, Bieber stated that hit songs including ""Sorry"", ""Mark My Words"", and ""What Do You Mean?"" are about his relationship with Gomez.[231]  Bieber became engaged to Hailey Baldwin on July 7, 2018.[232] They had briefly dated from December 2015 to January 2016 before splitting, then reconciled in May 2018. Bieber and Baldwin reportedly obtained a marriage license in September 2018,[233] leading to reports that they had a civil marriage.[234] On September 14, 2018, Baldwin stated on Twitter that she and Bieber had not yet married, but deleted the tweet afterward.[234] On November 23, 2018, Bieber stated he was married to Baldwin.[235] Bieber and Baldwin had an official ceremony in Bluffton, South Carolina on September 30, 2019.[236]  Beliefs  Bieber has described himself as a faithful adherent of Christianity, said he communicates with God via prayer, and that ""He's the reason I'm here"".[237] He reflected his faith in a music video with Brandon Burke, titled ""#iPledge"", in which he talks about God's forgiveness.[238] Bieber was baptized on January 9, 2014 by Pentecostal pastor Carl Lentz of Hillsong Church, New York, after a born again experience. He has described Lentz as a good friend.[239][240] When asked how he wants to raise his children, Bieber said, ""I'm a Jesus follower. When you accept Jesus, you walk with the holy spirit. I just want to be led by the holy spirit.""[241] Many of Bieber's tattoos have religious significance including the medium-sized cross on his chest and a tiny cross under his eye. Bieber also covered up the ""Son of God"" text tattooed on his abdomen with a large design that features two angels, gothic arches, a skeleton and a serpent.[242]  Regarding sexual abstinence, Bieber told music magazine Rolling Stone in 2011, ""I don't think you should have sex with anyone unless you love them."" He added that he does not ""believe in abortion"", and that it is ""like killing a baby"". When asked about the case of abortion with regard to rape, however, he said, ""I guess I haven't been in that position, so I wouldn't be able to judge that.""[224][243] His view on sexual orientation is quoted as ""everyone's own decision"",[244] and he has contributed to the It Gets Better Project,[245] a non-profit group aiming to prevent suicide among LGBT youth.[246]  Philanthropy  Bieber supports Pencils of Promise,[247] a charity founded by Adam Braun, the younger brother of Bieber's manager. The organization builds schools in developing countries, and Bieber became manager for the organization's campaign in Guatemala. He serves as a celebrity spokesman for the organization[248] by running ads for the charity and its campaign ""Schools4All"".[249][250] He promises to visit schools that donate the most funds to the organization.[251] He takes part in the charity's fund-raising galas and donates parts of the proceeds from his concerts and Someday line of fragrances,[252] and various merchandising to the charity. He also appears in an animal welfare PSA for PETA encouraging people to volunteer at and adopt from animal shelters instead of buying pets from breeders or pet stores.[253] In 2013, Bieber launched his online #GiveBackPhilippines campaign for helping the victims of Typhoon Haiyan and travelled to the Philippines after raising $3 million.[citation needed] His work in the country earned him a star on the Philippine Walk of Fame.[254] He also supports Children's Miracle Network Hospitals and Alzheimer's Association.[255][256]  Bieber and Ariana Grande collaborated on the single ""Stuck With U"", released in May 2020 as the first of series of singles coordinated by entertainment executive Scooter Braun, who is also Bieber's manager, to support the COVID-19 pandemic.[257] All net proceeds from the song went to the First Responders Children's Foundation to fund grants and scholarships for children of first responders and health care workers who worked on the front lines during the pandemic.[258]  Legal issues and controversies  Bieber had several run-ins with the law around the world before his first arrest in 2014,[259] including when he was accused of reckless driving in his neighbourhood in 2012, and charged in Brazil with vandalism in 2013.[259][260] One of his neighbours in Calabasas, California, accused Bieber of throwing eggs at his home on January 9, 2014, and causing thousands of dollars of damage.[259][261][262] On January 23, 2014, Bieber was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida, together with singer Khalil, on suspicion of driving under the influence (DUI), driving with an over six month expired license, and resisting arrest without violence.[260][263][264] Police said that Bieber told authorities he had consumed alcohol, smoked marijuana, and taken prescription drugs.[259] He has been released from these charges on a $2,500 bond.[265] A toxicology report revealed that Bieber had THC (a principal constituent of cannabis) and the anti-anxiety medication Xanax in his system at the time of his arrest.[266][267]  Justin Bieber's January 2014 mugshot, after being detained by police in Miami Beach, Florida  Following Bieber's arrest on the DUI charge, more than 270,000 people petitioned the White House seeking to have him deported from the United States. Although the number of signatures received was sufficient to require a response under published White House guidelines, the Obama Administration declined substantive comment on the petition.[268] Immigration Law expert Harlan York noted that the likelihood of Bieber being deported was extremely slim. York stated, ""About a decade ago, the Supreme Court ruled that driving under the influence, typically, is not a basis to deport someone.""[269]  On July 9, 2014, Bieber was charged with one misdemeanour count of vandalism in California for throwing eggs at his Calabasas neighbour's home in January.[262][270][271] Police earlier claimed that they had video footage of him high-fiving friends after the eggs were thrown.[262][272] With him pleading no contest to the charge, the Los Angeles County Superior Court sentenced him on July 9 to pay US$80,900 in restitution, serve two years' probation, complete twelve weeks of anger management, and five days of community service in what the district attorney termed a negotiated settlement. Since then, he has permanently moved to Beverly Hills, California.[262][270][271]  On August 13, 2014, the January DUI case was settled with a plea bargain; Bieber pleaded guilty to resisting an officer without violence and a lesser charge of driving without due care and attention. He was fined US$500 and sentenced to attend a 12-hour anger management course and a program that teaches the impact of drunken driving on victims. As part of the plea bargain, he made a US$50,000 contribution to Our Kids, a local children's charity.[273][274]  I didn't want to come off arrogant or conceited, or basically how I've been acting the past year, year and a half ... although what's happened in the past has happened, I just want to ... be kind and loving and gentle and soft. —Bieber reflects in a video posted in January 2015[275]  On September 1, 2014, Bieber was arrested and charged with assault and dangerous driving near his hometown of Stratford, Ontario, after a collision between a minivan and Bieber's all-terrain vehicle on August 29. Ontario police said that he then ""engaged in a physical altercation"" with an occupant of the minivan. He was released shortly and his lawyer blamed the incident on ""the unwelcome presence of paparazzi"".[276][277] On September 8, Toronto dropped an assault charge against him originally brought up on January 29 for an incident with a limousine driver in December 2013.[278][279] In November 2014, he was ordered to appear in Argentina within 60 days by a Buenos Aires court to give testimony on an alleged assault on a photographer on November 9, 2013.[280] When he failed to do so, an arrest warrant was issued and two of his bodyguards were released in Argentina in April 2015.[281]  In June 2014, a video emerged of a 15-year-old Bieber telling a joke about black people, which used the word ""nigger"" multiple times.[282] In the same month, a second video showed a 15-year-old Bieber giggling as he croons his song ""One Less Lonely Girl"", but parodying the main lyric as ""One less lonely nigger"", and stating that if he were to kill one, he would be ""part of the KKK"".[283][284] He apologized the day the latter was released: ""Facing my mistakes from years ago has been one of the hardest things I've ever dealt with.""[285]  In July 2017, the Chinese government banned Justin Bieber from performing in China. A Chinese Bieber fan reached out to the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture requesting the reason for the ban. The Bureau released a statement, explaining ""Justin Bieber is a gifted singer, but he is also a controversial young foreign singer"", and ""In order to maintain order in the Chinese market and purify the Chinese performance environment, it is not suitable to bring in badly behaved entertainers.""[286][287]  Health  Bieber has struggled with mental health issues,[288] particularly depression and anxiety,[289][290] at various points during his career.[291] He has generally been open about these issues.[292][293]  On January 8, 2020, on his Instagram, Bieber announced that he was diagnosed with Lyme disease, saying that speculation by other people that he looked like he was on drugs was false. He also revealed that he has infectious mononucleosis, which affected his neurological and overall health.[294][295]  Achievements  Throughout his career, Bieber has sold an estimated 150 million records as of 2019[296] and is one of the best-selling music artists globally.[297] In 2011, Bieber was honoured with a star in front of Avon Theater in Stratford, Ontario, Canada, where he used to busk when he was younger. On November 23, 2012, Bieber was presented with the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal by the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper. He was one of 60,000 Canadians to receive the Diamond Jubilee medal that year.[298] In 2013, Bieber received a Diamond award from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) to recognize his single ""Baby"" as the highest-certified digital song of all time (record later broken by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's ""Despacito"").[299][300] Bieber has earned ten Grammy nominations (including one win),[301][302][303] two Brit awards,[304][305] six NRJ Music Award nominations (Bieber won four awards out of six nominations, but he has six awards because he was honoured twice with special awards),[306][307][308] nineteen Billboard Music Awards,[309] and numerous fan voted accolades which include fifteen American Music Awards and[310] twenty three Teen Choice Awards.[311] He also has won twenty one MTV Europe Music Awards (one is a special award), which is the most awards received by a single artist to date.[312]  On November 13, 2015, the release of Purpose marked his sixth album to debut at number one. He also became the first artist, since Elvis Presley in 2005, to replace his own song as number one on the UK Singles Chart.[313] As of 2016, Bieber has received fourteen titles in the Guinness World Records, which include eight that were achieved from the success of his album Purpose and was featured in the 2017 Edition. These records included the most streamed track on Spotify in one week, the most streamed album on Spotify in one week, the most simultaneous tracks and most simultaneous new entries on the US Billboard Hot 100 by a solo artist, the first act to occupy all top three positions simultaneously on the UK Singles Chart, the most followers on Twitter by a male, the most viewed music channel on YouTube by an individual, and the most subscribers on YouTube for a musician by a male.[314]  Bieber was included among the top ten in The Highest-Paid Celebrities Under 30 annual list in the world by Forbes magazine. He has been listed six times in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017.[315]  ""Steps to Stardom"", an exhibit on Bieber's early career, opened in his hometown of Stratford, Ontario in February 2018 at the Stratford Perth Museum, offering a collection of mementoes from his formative years and rise to international stardom.[316] The items on display include a professional drum kit he owned as a younger child, his Grammy Award, microphones, his Stratford Warriors hockey jacket, and personal letters, including one from Michelle Obama.[316] Bieber made a number of visits to the museum.[317][318] ""Steps to Stardom"" was originally scheduled to close in October 2018 but board of the museum extended its stay for at least another year after the exhibit broke attendance records set by its Anne Frank House exhibit in 2015.[319]  Discography  Studio albums  Filmography  Tours  See also  References",real

4260,"About  Internet Death Hoaxes refer to unfounded rumors or misreports of someone's death, usually a celebrity, or otherwise famous public figure, that spread virally online, particularly through social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook.  Origin  One the original pre-internet celebrity death hoaxes was a rumor of Beatle Paul McCartney's death in 1966. One of the first death hoaxes to spread online was the 2010 Morgan Freeman death hoax.On December 16th, 2010, Twitter user OriginalCJiZZle tweeted a message asserting that actor Morgan Freeman had died, prefaced by an RT (retweet) signature credited to CNN to make it appear as if the news organization had tweeted the original report:  ""RT @CNN: Breaking News: actor Morgan Freeman has passed away in his Burbank home<< wow legendary actor #RIPmorganfreeman.""      CNN quickly issued a response explaining that it had not reported on Freeman’s death via Twitter :  ""CNN did not report Morgan Freeman death. Rumor is false. CNN will aggressively investigate this hoax.""      The same day, CNN published an article titled “Who said Morgan Freeman is dead? Not us,"" in which the news outlet reiterated their previous response and included a confirmation from the actor's publicist Stan Rosenfield that Freeman was still alive.  Notable Cases  Steve Jobs  Between Apple CEO Steve Jobs' announcement of his diagnosis in 2004 and his death in 2011, there had been a number of premature obituaries and breaking news updates falsely reporting on the passing of Apple's co-founder. Jobs maintained his chief executie role in the company until August 2011 when he resigned from his post.  In August 2008, Bloomberg mistakenly published an obituary article of Steve Jobs that had been put together by the staff in the case of such event. The report quickly spread through its corporate news service and the rumor intensified as blogs and other news carriers began syndicating the story.  During the Macworld Keynote speech in January 2009, Apple-related forum MacRumors was infiltrated by a hacker who defaced the website with false news of Steve Job's death that read ""STEVE JOBS JUST DIED."" The news media speculated that the hacker was associated with Anonymous and 4chan .  In September 2011, CBS reported via one of its Twitter accounts that Steve Jobs had passed from a heart attack. The post was removed within minutes with a formal retraction, but not before the information was re-tweeted by some of the account’s 11,000+ followers.  Cher  On January 26th, 2012, Twitter user Lorraine Star tweeted out a rumor that singer Cher had died, making it appear as if the tweet had originated from CNN:  ""RT @CNN: American recording artist Cher dies at 65 years old. Found dead in Malibu home.""      The rumor was further fueled when Kim Kardashian tweeted:  ""Did I juist hear Cher has passed away? Is this real? OMG""      The rumor was dispelled on January 27th, when Loree Rodkin , a friend of the singer, tweeted:  ""Whoever started that stupid rumor needs to have their face dragged across concrete..#cher is FINE""      Adele  On January 28th, 2012, RIP Adele was a trending topic on Twitter. This was proven untrue by the International Business Times and Gossip Cop.  Paul McCartney  On March 21st, 2012, RIP Paul McCartney began to trend on Twitter. The rumor was dispelled by a post on Gossip Cop published the next day.  Chris Brown  On March 23rd, 2012, rumors of singer Chris Brown's death spread on Twitter and on YouTube through comments on his music videos. The singer was the victim of several previous death rumors including one that spread on Twitter on February 15th, 2012.  Celine Dion  On November 9th, 2013, a rumor about the supposed death of singer Celine Dion circulated on Facebook. Authenticity was lent to the claim by an app that can put news organization logos on unaffiliated posts. Dion spoke to Digital Spy the same day to dispel rumors, saying:  ""Sometimes it's freaky because I have to call my family about it. I was celebrating the birthday of my twins in Montreal and I was getting these phone calls saying there was stuff on Facebook that I was dead. The thing that worries me is my mom. It makes me a little mad – she's 86 years old and if I'm not on the phone telling her I'm OK four seconds after it's on the news… it doesn't matter what they say, it's the impact it has on your family.""      Justin Bieber  On January 8th, 2014, a rumor that singer Justin Bieber had died in a car crash after driving over 120 miles per hour in his Ferrari circulated on Twitter. On January 12th, Global Associated News , a site known for spreading celebrity death rumors, published a post saying Bieber had died in a car crash:  ""Justin Bieber died in a single vehicle crash on Route 80 between Morristown and Roswell. He was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics responding to the vehicle accident and was identified by photo ID found on his body. Alcohol and drugs do not appear to have been a factor in this accident.""      The claim was proved false when Bieber posted a photo of his new tattoo to his Instagram account.  Jim Carrey  On January 12th, 2014, an rumor that actor Jim Carrey circulated on Facebook, but was quickly disproved when Carrey appeared at the Golden Globes held that evening. A second death rumor circulated on Facebook on January 14th, suggesting the actor had died in a snowboarding accident. A representative for the actor released a statement saying:  ""He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. He's still alive and well, stop believing what you see on the Internet.""      Subway Jared  On May 5th, 2014, Twitter user nice_mustard sent a tweet using the hashtag #RIPSubwayJared which implied Jared Fogle, who has been a spokesman for the sandwich chain Subway since 2000, had died. In less than 24 hours the hashtag #RIPSubwayJared had been tweeted out over 6,000 times. Nice_Mustard also tweeted out a request that their original RIP tweet be retweeted and the hashtag be spread.      The claim was proved false the same day in a post published on Gossip Cop.  Betty White  On September 3rd, 2014, Empire News, a satirical news site published an article about actress Betty White dying her hair with a pun in the title, ""Actress Betty White, 92, Dyes Peacefully In Her Los Angeles Home."" The title lead some readers to believe White had actually died. Within 24 hours the hashtag #BettyWhite was tweeted out over 100 times, with Twitter users inquiring whether White had died, or confirming it was simply a hoax. The hoax was covered that day my several sites including Business 2 Community and the Inquisitr.      Macaulay Culkin  On November 7th, 2014, a fake memorial page for actor and musician Macaulay Culkin was created on Facebook, which linked to a spoofed MSNBC article claiming the 34-year-old actor had passed away earlier that day (shown below). Within 72 hours, the article gained over 153,000 Facebook likes and 22,500 retweets.      The Facebook memorial page was subsequently removed. On November 8th, Culkin’s Velvet Underground cover band Pizza Underground tweeted a photograph of the actor with the caption “We’re on tour you silly people” (shown below, left). That same day, the rumor-debunking website Snopes posted an entry for Culkin's death hoax. On November 9th, Pizza Underground tweeted another photograph of Culkin being held up by a friend while posing as if he were dead, in reference to a scene from the 1989 comedy cult film Weekend at Bernie’s (shown below, right).      In the coming days, several news sites published articles about the hoax, including Mashable, UpRoxx, The Daily Dot, CBS News and People.

3789,"Hollywood is practically built on rumors and hearsays, so it’s no surprise that there have been reports of all kinds about the Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt situation. Numerous publications have been circulating details about how the pair will supposedly reunite on-screen with a romantic comedy project, for example. There have also been reports of the two getting married. As it turns out, neither of these is true.  Listing a variety of rumors and reports that it considers false, Gossip Cop has certainly gone out of its way to try and prove other publications wrong. The stated fictional declarations on that list include the supposed secret Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt marriage and that the pair is engaged once again.  Apparently, publications have been taking the smallest details to spin a narrative that was nowhere close to the truth. For example, a snapshot of the “Friends” actress wearing a ring for the movie she was shooting called “Murder Mystery” was mistaken for an engagement ring. This was quickly picked up and circulated all over the web, leading to a Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt rumor feeding frenzy.  There were also some reports about the former married couple tying the knot once more to celebrate what would have been their 18th wedding anniversary. As Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt rumors go, this one might just be one of the most misleading.  The part about the two actors being in a romantic-comedy has also been debunked recently by Gossip Cop, as well, which was reposted by MSN. Neither of the Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt parties had shown any indication that such a rumor was even close to being true. In fact, past discussions alluding to the same topic have been denied by spokespersons of the actors before.  For Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt news that does come with evidence, it would seem that the “Fight Club” actor likes to model his look after whoever he is currently dating. This tidbit was posted by Twitter user Sarah McGonagall after she spotted it on an old Daily Express article. At least this proposition actually has photographic proof.",fake

387,"Kevin Federline wants to triple the $20,000 in monthly child support he receives from Britney Spears.  Federline, 40, claims that Spears’ increased earnings compared with his decreasing income create “an extreme disparity” in their sons’ lifestyles from her home to his, documents obtained by The Blast revealed Tuesday.  Federline alleged in the documents that his work as a DJ nets him less than 1 percent of Spears’ reported $34 million income because he is “less of a name” than he was in 2008 when he took in six figures.  The former backup dancer claims he earns roughly $3,000 per month but that he doesn’t know how much Spears, 36, truly earns because she has allegedly refused to turn over her tax returns or reveal her income.  The couple, who were married from 2004 to 2007, agreed at the time that Spears would make $20,000 monthly child support payments to Federline for sons Sean Preston, 12, and Jayden James, 11. She also gave him $1.3 million at the time of their split.  Spears agreed to the terms through her father, Jamie, who controls her finances through a conservatorship to this day following her highly publicized breakdown in 2007.  Since then, she’s landed two lucrative Las Vegas residencies, gone on tour, released four new albums, five compilation albums, 18 fragrances and a lingerie line.  Federline laments in the documents that “[Spears] is a single woman who lives alone in a 13,264 square foot Neoclassical Italianate villa on 21 acres of land in a gated community with an elevator, a library, a media/game room, 3,500 bottle wine cellar, an additional 1,200 square foot pool house, an orchard, resort-sized pool and spa, lighted tennis court and three-green golf course. In contrast, Respondent lives with his wife, his two minor children from his current marriage, the two minor children he shares with Petitioner and two minor children from a previous relationship in a 2,000 square foot home.”  He claims that Spears (who’s currently dating hunky fitness junkie Sam Asghari) offers the boys amenities including private chefs, tutors, nannies and other staff, as well as the best toys and gadgets available and that he simply can’t keep up with their luxuries in his 2,000-square-foot home, in which his wife Victoria Prince, their two children and his two children from ex-wife Shar Jackson all live.  Federline has previously rejected attempts to settle the child support battle without litigation.  “It’s their position that they don’t have to turn over Britney’s financial information, including tax returns, which is required under the California family code. It’s not California celebrity code edition, she has to comply,” Federline’s lawyer, Mark Vincent Kaplan, told Us Weekly Tuesday. “This is the choice they have made, and they will now have to deal with it. We are still open to try and settling this without judicial intervention.”  Neither a rep nor an attorney for Spears immediately returned a request for comment.",fake
2059,"UPDATED with more reactions: Refresh for latest… Hollywood is waking up to the news that Brad Grey, who ran Paramount Pictures for 12 years as chairman and CEO and before that was a partner in the powerhouse management/production company Brillstein-Grey Entertainment, has died of cancer at 59. Grey exited Paramount officially in February.  Here are some reactions to the death of the man who oversaw a number of Paramount franchises including Transformers, Star Trek, Mission: Impossible, Paranormal Activity and Jackass. And before that at Brillstein, he worked on The Sopranos, Real Time with Bill Maher, The Steve Harvey Show and, of course, Garry Shandling’s The Larry Sanders Show.  Here is what Hollywood is saying. Check back for updates.  Related Story Brad Grey Dies OF Cancer: Former Paramount Chief Was 59  David Chase, The Sopranos creator:  “Brad was a grand partner and colleague. His taste was exquisite, he was so intelligent. When you went to pitch with Brad, it was actually fun. He had such confidence underneath a cool, amused exterior. The thing I will remember most about Brad is his generosity. He loved movies, he loved entertainment, he loved life. He loved his success and he made sure to share it with the people who surrounded him. I’m going to miss him terribly.”  Martin Scorsese, Oscar-winning filmmaker:  “Brad Grey was a true friend, and he genuinely loved movies. Our professional relationship started with The Departed, which he basically shepherded into existence —sadly, he is uncredited as a producer on that picture, but that’s the title he deserved. He and I worked together on every picture I made since, all the way through Silence, and he was always extremely protective of the creative process, very careful to keep it separate from all infighting and financial entanglements — in other words, the business. Like so many of Brad’s friends, I’m in a state of shock.”  Jim Gianopulos, Chairman & CEO of Paramount Pictures:  All of us at Paramount are deeply saddened by the news of Brad Grey’s passing. He was at the helm of the studio for over a decade and was responsible for so many of it’s most beloved films. We extend our deepest sympathies to Cassandra, Max, Sam, Emily and Jules Grey, along with Brad’s mother, brother and sister. I was proud to call Brad a friend, and one I greatly admired. He will be missed by us all, and left his mark on our industry and in our hearts.  I am devastated over the loss of my best friend since I was twenty-two, Brad Grey. My heart is with his family, who are my family. — bob saget (@bobsaget) May 15, 2017  Brillstein Entertainment Group:  Brad was a unique force in our business and a self-made man. Brad helped forge a new paradigm in representing artists and worked to reinvent how a management company can serve its clients. Our hearts go out to his family, whom he loved dearly. As a company, we are indebted to his legacy.  Jim Berkus, UTA chairman:  “Brad Grey was a colleague, collaborator and, most importantly, a great friend. As a talent executive, he fought for his clients and helped stretch the boundaries of tradition to enable his clients to do great things. As a studio executive, he was committed to making movies that would stand the test of time. He created a legacy in our industry that will have a lasting impact. All of UTA mourns his loss, and we will miss him greatly.”  At Bernie Brillstein memorial Brad said to me, ""In the blink of an eye John, it goes so fast, enjoy it all"" I'm in shock. #BradGrey pic.twitter.com/Lw6Fw7WeT9 — John Stamos (@JohnStamos) May 15, 2017  HBO:  All of us at HBO are heartsick to learn of the passing of our colleague and friend Brad Grey. From his early days as a founding partner of Brillstein-Grey, he brought many great comedic artists to HBO, and of course one of TV’s most iconic shows, The Sopranos, for which he served as Executive Producer. More importantly he was a friend, supporter and cheerleader for all of us for many years. We will miss him very much. Our heart goes out to his entire family.  Bob Iger, Chairman and CEO of the Walt Disney Company:  I was stunned and saddened to learn of Brad Grey’s passing. He was a dear friend, a respected colleague, and a great guy. He will be sorely missed by everyone who had the privilege of knowing him. My thoughts are with his wife Cassandra, his children, and his entire family.  Bob Weinstein, Co-Chairman of the Weinstein Company:  I knew Brad for over 40 years. He started out as me and my brother’s assistant and within 6 months it was clear that we should be working for him and not the other way around. He was destined for great things in this business, but more importantly on a personal level, I knew him as a family man and nothing was more important to him than that. My condolences to his family and he will be missed.  Filmmaker Ava Duvernay:  Before Selma was released, he invited me to dinner. Fab stories. Good laughs. And shrewd advice that I still use. May his soul be at rest.  Rest In Peace, Brad Grey. He was always good to me, in the small passing moments we had. My heart goes out to his family and loved ones. — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) May 15, 2017  I was lucky to be represented by Brad Grey early in my career.

13580,"As expected, Justin Timberlake announced a new album entitled “Man of the Woods” and a new single coming Friday via a minute-long video posted on his social media accounts. The album is due Feb. 2 — two days before his halftime performance on the Super Bowl on Feb. 4.  “This album is really inspired by my son, my wife, my family, but more so than any album I’ve ever written, where I’m from — it’s personal,” he says in the video, which is filled with shots of Timberlake in outdoors settings. In other shots he is seen working with Pharrell Williams, who says “It feels so earthy, it’s just where you are in your life right now,” before adding emphatically, “That is a smash,” presumably about a song. Snippets of two or three new songs play in the background during the video.  While the wintery scenes contrast with Timberlake’s upbringing in Memphis, Tennessee, he has been saying for some months that the album, on which he also worked with longtime collaborators Max Martin and Shellback (with whom he collaborated on his last single, the hit “Can’t Stop the Feeling” from the movie “Trolls”) and Timbaland, reflected his roots, calling it “Southern American music.”  Timberlake’s halftime performance during the Super Bowl is set for Sunday, Feb. 4 at Minneapolis’ U.S. Bank Stadium. Variety reported that he was the frontrunner on Sept. 27.",real

5074,"Hoda Kotb is a longtime news contributor and personality for NBC. In January 2018, she was named co-host of the opening hours of the network's flagship morning program, 'Today.'  Who Is Hoda Kotb?  Born in Oklahoma in 1964 to Egyptian parents, Hoda Kotb began her broadcasting career as a news assistant in 1986. She became a correspondent for Dateline NBC in 1998, carving out a strong reputation for her journalistic work, before earning a fan base for her lively personality as co-host of Today's 10 a.m. time slot. Taking over the higher-profile 7 and 8 a.m. hours after Matt Lauer was fired in November 2017, Kotb was formally named co-host of the show's opening hours, with Savannah Guthrie, in January 2018, marking the first time two female hosts were paired together in Today's history.  'Today' Co-Host  On January 2, 2018, Hoda Kotb began the New Year with the announcement that she was officially taking over as co-host of the 7 and 8 a.m hours of NBC’s daily morning talk show Today, alongside Savannah Guthrie.  Kotb, the longtime co-host of Today’s 10 a.m. hour, had served as interim host of the opening hours since late November 2017, when previous anchor Matt Lauer was fired for inappropriate workplace behavior. Her pairing with Guthrie had proved a winning combination, as Today surpassed the ratings of the rival ABC program Good Morning America for four consecutive weeks, prompting Today execs to make the move permanent.  'Dateline' to Kathie Lee Cohort  Prior to her ascension to the high-profile opening hours of Today, Kotb had been a valued member of NBC for nearly 20 years. She joined the network in 1998 as a correspondent for the newsmagazine Dateline NBC, and went on to cover some of the most important domestic and international events of the time, including the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia, the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. She also conducted exclusive interviews with notable figures such as Burmese leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and hosted the weekly syndicated series Your Total Health from 2004 to 2008.  Kotb began hosting the 10 a.m. hour of Today in September 2007, and the following spring was paired with veteran morning talk show host Kathie Lee Gifford in the slot. The two demonstrated an easy rapport as they sipped wine and riffed on issues of the day, sharing an Emmy win with the rest of the Today team in 2010. After Gifford left Today in April 2019, Kotb was joined by Jenna Bush Hager for the show's fourth hour.  Kotb also substituted for both Guthrie and Lauer on Today and stepped in for various network-related specials, including coverage of the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.  Egyptian Parents, American Upbringing  Hoda Kotb was born on August 9, 1964, in Norman, Oklahoma. The middle child of Egyptian immigrants who left Cairo to study at the University of Oklahoma, Kotb was raised in an English-speaking household, describing her assimilated parents as people who ""wanted us to be red, white and blue."" She spent her childhood in Morgantown, West Virginia, and Alexandria, Virginia, save for a year abroad in Nigeria and extended vacations with family in Egypt.  After attending Fort Hunt High School in Alexandria, Kotb stayed close to home to attend Virginia Tech University. She became involved with the Delta Delta Delta sorority and WUVT, the student radio station, before earning her B.A. in broadcast journalism in 1986.  Early Career  Kotb immediately embarked on her broadcasting career after college, joining CBS in 1986 as a news assistant in her parents' hometown of Cairo. After that, she moved on to stints for CBS and ABC affiliates in Illinois, Mississippi and Florida, before settling in as a reporter and anchor for WWL-TV in New Orleans, Louisiana, from 1992 to 1998.  Breast Cancer Survivor  Kotb was diagnosed with breast cancer in early 2007 after her gynecologist discovered lumps during a routine exam. Despite her years as host of Your Total Health, she had never undergone a mammogram.  Kotb opted to skip chemotherapy but underwent a mastectomy, a procedure that required an extensive mental and physical recuperation period. While keeping a journal of her recovery, she wrote the word ""forward"" at the end of each entry as a means of overcoming day-to-day difficulties and keeping faith in her progress.  After coming across a breast cancer walk in Central Park later that year, Kotb decided to go public with her story. Shortly after joining Today in 2007, she shared her experiences in an October episode as part of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.  Awards and Other Endeavors  In 2007, Kotb was part of the Dateline team honored with a prestigious Peabody Award for The Education of Ms. Groves, a documentary chronicling the challenges facing a first-year teacher at an urban middle school in Atlanta, Georgia. She is also a recipient of the Edward R. Murrow Award, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award and four Gracie Awards, and has been nominated for numerous Emmys.  Along with her celebrated broadcasting work, Kotb in 2010 published her memoir, Hoda: How I Survived War Zones, Bad Hair, Cancer, and Kathie Lee. She has since written two more books, Ten Years Later: Six People Who Faced Adversity and Transformed Their Lives (2013) and Where They Belong: The Best Decisions That People Almost Never Made (2016) .  The TV personality has also pulled double duty as a radio host since launching The Hoda Show on SiriusXM in February 2015.  Romantic Partners and Children  In 2005, Kotb married Burzis Kanga, the former tennis coach for the University of New Orleans, but they divorced two years later.  In 2013, the TV personality began dating financier Joel Schiffman. Unable to have children after her treatments for cancer, she adopted daughter Haley Joy in February 2017, introducing the 12-week-old to Today fans that Mother’s Day. In April 2019, Kotb adopted another girl, named Hope Catherine.  That November, Kotb announced her engagement to Schiffman.",real

Apparently, the two dated before she joined Season 21, with the relationship going long-distance for over a year.  The source also maintains she’s “still hung up” on him, which is why she’s “stalling” in getting more serious with Nick.  A post shared by Nick Viall (@nickviall) on Mar 25, 2017 at 11:29am PDT  “There’s no doubt she still has feelings for [Michael],” the insider states.  So much so, they even report “whispers” she might break up with the Wisconsin hunk to go back with her former beau.  A post shared by Nick Viall (@nickviall) on Apr 1, 2017 at 2:01pm PDT  She’s even said to have met up with him last July, prior to being cast on the reality series.  “They’re both on the fun-loving, goofy side, so they got along great,” the source claims.  As interesting as it is that the 29-year-old has a past with a semi-famous actor, it sounds like all this buzz is for nothing.  Gossip Cop debunked the rumor soon after, emphasizing there’s no proof the former couple has any intention of getting back together.  A post shared by VanessaGrimaldi (@vanessagrimaldi30) on Mar 31, 2017 at 12:48pm PDT  “This is a non-existent love triangle that was manufactured simply because Grimaldi happens to have a relatively famous ex,” the site insists.  That doesn’t mean the newly-engaged pair are out of the woods — there is the issue of the Bachelor spending most of his time practicing for DWTS and not with her.",fake

Katie Holmes Embraces Therapy & Jamie Foxx To Get Revenge On Cruise Scientology opposes traditional psychotherapies.  Crafty Katie Holmes is throwing some backhanded shade on ex-husband Tom Cruise and Scientology, RadarOnline.com has learned, by parading her romance with Jamie Foxx and lauding psychological therapy — which the church disdains.  “Katie says therapy is the ONLY thing that saved her and daughter Suri from her suffocating marriage to Tom and the clutches of the church,” a source revealed to RadarOnline.com exclusively. “Now she wants to pass on the benefit of her experience to help other women who’ve weathered similar nightmares.”  Though Holmes, 38, escaped Cruise (and Scientology) in 2012, she’s determined to continue being an advocate of therapy. So it may be no surprise that her next role is in the adaptation of the best-selling self-help book “The Secret.”  “Katie hopes to use the film to become a self-help guru and completely defy Scientology’s views of therapy,” said the source.  The actress had refused offers to write an explosive tell-all about her stifling marriage to Tom and the iron fist of the church. But she’s finally gone public with the worst-kept secret relationship ever — her romance with Cruise’s longtime pal Foxx — and is now happy to show it off to the world.  “She loves the fact this will be the ultimate slap in Tom’s face!”  We pay for juicy info!

""She was beautiful. I cried a little watching her,"" Thomas Markle said on ""Good Morning Britain."" ""I was very proud and I couldn't see a better moment in my life. The whole world was watching my daughter.""  ""The unfortunate thing now is that I'm a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history instead of a dad walking his daughter down the aisle,"" he said. ""It was a very emotional moment. I regretted it because I really wanted to walk her down the aisle. But I'm thankful for how it all went.""  Meghan Markle and Prince Harry attend a Wheelchair Tennis match during the Invictus Games 2017 at Nathan Philips Square, Sept. 25, 2017, in Toronto. Chris Jackson/Getty Images  Meghan's father admitted to being a bit jealous that he was not at the wedding, but expressed thanks to Prince Charles, Harry's father, for stepping in.  ""I can't think of a better replacement than Prince Charles,"" said Markle. ""He looked very handsome. I was jealous, I wish it was me, but thank God he was there and I thank him for that.""  The father of the bride, who described his daughter as a ""princess,"" said that he imagines Prince Charles was thrilled to walk his daughter down the aisle.  ""It might have been a treat for him as well because he didn't have a daughter.""  The Prince of Wales has expressed many times how he had always hoped to have a daughter. He has become particularly close to his new daughter-in-law, Meghan.  Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, places the wedding ring on Meghan Markle during their wedding ceremony in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, in Windsor, on May 19, 2018. Jonathan Brady/AFP/Getty Images  Thomas Markle decided to withdraw from the wedding after the U.K.'s Mail on Sunday claimed that he had been participating in staged photo shoots to help his image.

But again he backed out several days later after saying he had suffered a heart attack and would be unable to travel.  ""Good Morning Britain"" host Piers Morgan disclosed on-air that Markle, who lives in Mexico, was paid ""a few thousands pounds"" for his interview with the TV show.  Markle said his daughter was only concerned about his health in a tearful phone call with Prince Harry when he shared that he would be unable to attend her wedding.  ""They were disappointed,"" he said. ""Meghan cried, I'm sure, and they both said, 'Take care of yourself, we are really worried about you.'""  Meghan's father said he apologized to Meghan and Harry for his error in judgment with regard to taking the photos.  ""I realized it was a serious mistake,"" he said. ""It's hard to take it back.""  Kensington Palace issued a statement on Meghan’s behalf shortly before the wedding and after her father announced he would be undergoing heart surgery.  ""Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding,"" Markle, 36, said in the statement from Kensington Palace. ""I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.  ""I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support,"" the statement continued. ""Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.""  First conversation with Meghan about her new boyfriend  The first phone calls were, ""Daddy, I have a new boyfriend.' And I said, 'That's really nice,' and the next phone call was like, 'He's British,' and I said, 'That's really nice,' and eventually the third time around was like: 'He's a prince.'""  He continued: ""And at that point, she said, 'It's Harry,' and I said, 'Oh, Harry, OK!' She said, 'Of course we’ll have to call him 'H' so no one knows we're talking about Harry.'""  ""We talked a little about how they met and how happy they were with each other,"" Markle reflected.  ""He's quite easy to talk to; he's quite a comfortable person to talk to,"" Markle added. ""I wasn't nervous. Ten thousand miles apart, it's hard to be nervous talking to someone on the phone.""  Asking for Meghan's hand in marriage  Thomas Markle recounted the moment when Prince Harry asked him for his daughter's hand in marriage over the phone.  ""You are a gentleman, promise me you will never raise your hand against my daughter and of course I will grant you my permission,'"" he recalled saying.  Markle said his daughter has ""been a princess since the day she was born,"" adding, ""He made a good pick, didn't he?""  When asked about Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, Markle replied, ""I’ve had respect for that women since I was a child. I think she’s one of the most incredible women in the world and I would love to meet her.""

""I can't give you a date, no, [but] it was certainly a few months before the announcement of the engagement,"" he said.  ""My daughter is very intelligent. She knows how to choose who she wants to be with. She's a smart girl and she made a good pick. The royals are very complicated, but she can always rise to that occasion.

Meghan Markle walks down the aisle as she arrives for the wedding ceremony to Prince Harry at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle in Windsor, May 19, 2018. Danny Lawson/AP  On the staged photos and paparazzi deal  For the first time Meghan's father discussed the leaked photographs and his agreement to participate in order to change his image.  ""For the last year photographs of me were always derogatory,"" he explained. ""They would take pictures of my hand grabbing the beer, they’d take pictures of me getting in my car, taking the garbage out, they’d take pictures of me buying a toilet and making a big deal out of it. They took all kinds of pictures making me look negative.""  He said he apologized to his daughter and son-in-law over the phone.  ""I thought this would be a nice way of me improving my look. Well obviously that all went to hell. And I feel bad about it,"" he said. ""I apologized for it and that’s all I can do. I can't do much beyond that. That was a mistake.  Markle added, ""I didn’t do this for money; I did this to change my image. For one whole year I was presented as a hermit hiding out in Mexico. I was looking to change my image and obviously that was a mistake that went wrong.""  On Markle’s nickname for his daughter  Markle also spoke warmly about his nickname for his daughter and how it came about.  ""When she was a child she loved ""Jack and the Beanstalk."" ...

However, thankfully for Meghan, her mother Doria Ragland arrived in London on Wednesday to be by her side. “Meghan would not be able to handle all of this stress without her mom there,” the source said, adding, “Doria is one of the most grounded women ever and can calm Meghan down more than anyone.”  The report also adds that Prince Harry is least bothered about the tensions in Meghan’s family. “Harry isn’t bothered at all by all of this drama that is going on with her family and told her he doesn’t care about any of it. She feels like she is letting him down and he assured her that it is not the case,” an insider was quoted as saying.

They expand. One love isn’t moved out to make room for someone new. An addition is built.”  Ms. Sandberg, who has spoken often of her grief over the unexpected death of her husband, Dave Goldberg, in May 2015, also weighed in with a message of support for Mr. Oswalt and Ms. Salenger and praise for Ms. Roman’s piece.  “I laughed and cried a bit because what you are saying is so true,” she wrote on Facebook. “No one should judge another’s path — and everyone deserves to find love again.”  Mr. Oswalt, a stand-up comedian known for a string of roles on film and television, including the sitcom “The King of Queens,” has been very public about his struggle with grief after the death of his wife. In an interview with The New York Times last October, Mr. Oswalt said he would “never be at 100 percent again.”",real

The rapper posted a photo of the hallways in the home he shares with wife Kim Kardashian West with the caption, “Do this look like the sunken place?” — a reference to the mental state where Missy Armitage (Catherine Keener) sends the black people she imprisons in her home in the film.

The cruel and malicious publication of these stories is particularly offensive because Mr. Simmons fully supports individual autonomy and the essential human dignity of every person to make his or her own personal choices regarding sexual identity,"" the complaint stated.  The Hollywood Reporter obtained a copy of the complaint and reported that it said the following:  The National Enquirer and Radar Online have cheaply and crassly commercialized and sensationalized an issue that ought to be treated with respect and sensitivity. Principles of freedom of speech and press may protect their prerogative to mock and degrade the LGBTQ community. But freedom to speak is not freedom to defame. Mr. Simmons, like every person in this nation, has a legal right to insist that he not be portrayed as someone he is not. Even the most ardent supporter of sexual autonomy and LGBTQ rights is entitled to be portrayed in a manner that is truthful.  “While we have not seen Mr. Simmons’ complaint, we stand by our reporting about him, all of which was based on solid sourcing and material evidence,” a spokesman for American Media Inc. said, according to NBC News. “Should he choose to proceed with his lawsuit, we will defend it vigorously, and we look forward to the public vindication of our reports.”  RELATED: Rosie O’Donnell feels sympathy for Joan Crawford after being accused of abuse by her own daughter, Chelsea  “People have a right to privacy, and just because someone is a public figure doesn't mean their right to privacy is gone.” Simmons’ manager, Michael Catalano said in a statement to NBC News. “Richard is very glad get his side of the story out.

3951,"The Kardashians have baby fever — literally. Now that Khloé Kardashian welcomed her first child, True Thompson, with serial cheater boyfriend Tristan Thompson, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are looking to expand their family, again! The couple is already parents to North, 4, Saint, 2, and Chicago, 3 months, but a source told Radar Online they are itching for baby No. 4 by the end of this year.  “It’s always been a question of when, not if they’ll add to the family,” the source explained. “They’re confident they can cope with this because of the support they have with childcare.” And, yes, Kim will likely go the surrogate route again as the publication reported that she will probably use the same woman who carried Chicago.  Although Kim and Kanye are ready for a fourth child — hopefully another son if Kanye had it his way — some close friends don’t think it’s such a good idea. Radar Online reported that this could be something that actually tears them apart since their relationship isn’t in the greatest place at the moment.  “A lot of people think it’s crazy, since their marriage is hardly in the ideal place and they’re already struggling to cope with the demands of three kids,” the source said. “But they’re ignoring all reason and going with their impulse here.”  While Kim and Kanye have yet to comment on the possibility of adding to their family so soon, the KKW Beauty star did tell Elle‘s April issue that a fourth baby would be her last. “I don’t think I could handle more than [four kids]. My time is spread really thin,” Kim explained. “And I think it’s important that in all couples, the mom gives the husband as much attention as the kids.”  Kim and Kanye started dating in April 2012 before tying the knot in 2014 and they are still the perfect match for each other. “He’s taught me to have more of an opinion,” Kim admitted. “I’ve taught him to be a bit more calm or cautious. We’re a good balance.”",fake
3173,"© Gossip Cop (Getty Images) Is Queen Elizabeth ordering Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to tone down the PDA? That’s the latest rumor to emerge in the tabloids about the royal family. Gossip Cop, however, can bust the untrue claims.  The story in question appears in the Australian edition of Woman’s Day, which exclaims in a headline, “The Queen Is Not Amused!” The piece begins by asserting Prince Harry and Markle “couldn’t keep their hands off each other” at the Royal Foundation Forum last month, and contends that “while their affectionate behavior may be adorable to many, one person isn’t so thrilled: Harry’s grandmother.” It’s specifically alleged the queen has “warned Harry to tone down the public displays of affection… and start acting more prim and proper like other royals,” namely Prince William and Kate Middleton.  “Being affectionate just comes naturally to Harry and Meghan, but it’s totally against royal protocol,” claims a so-called “insider,” who further alleges, “The queen isn’t thrilled about it at all and word is she summoned Harry to the palace to remind him what’s expected of a royal.” This supposed tipster maintains, “All the hand-holding just isn’t the royal way at all.”  Consequently, the outlet asserts Prince Harry understands “he and Meghan will have to tone things down from now on.” Alleges the publication’s purported source, “Harry has so much respect for his grandmother, and while he doesn’t see anything wrong with what they’re doing in public, he certainly wouldn’t want to be seen as disobeying orders.” But Queen Elizabeth, Gossip Cop has learned, has never given Prince Harry and Markle any such “order.”  Contrary to the assertions here, there are no official royal protocols against PDA. In fact, Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla were photographed sharing a kiss last year. They also regularly hold hands in public. In contrast, his oldest son and daughter-in-law tend to avoid showing PDA while in the public eye, though Prince William and Middleton have held hands on occasion, such as when they were photographed arriving for a Christmas service in December. Simply put, it is up to each couple to decide what conduct is appropriate for them and under which setting. Prince Harry and Markle like to hold hands, although it’s possible their decorum will change once they officially wed.  Regardless, they haven’t engaged in any behavior that is actually out of line. And if the tabloid’s “insider” really had inside knowledge, he or she would know that not only isn’t there any official protocol against PDA, but that Prince Charles and Prince William have shown affection to their respective significant others without repercussion. It’s also worth noting that Prince Harry and Markle even held hands during the official photos taken following their engagement announcement (see above). Clearly this kind of PDA is a non-issue.

2304,"Even before tying the knot with a private wedding in 2008, Beyoncé and Jay Z have long been #RelationshipGoals.  Despite being among music’s most respected and iconic artists, influencers and, ultimately, power couples, one of their most admirable qualities has been keeping their personal business in the background while still standing at the forefront of elite stardom. The rightfully glorified relationship between the Houston starlet and New York rap heavyweight, blooming from over a decade ago, has since gracefully passed the test of time and birthed a beautiful baby girl, Blue Ivy Carter, and soon-to-be twins of the Carter family.  But even the most idolized of relationships trail obstacle-ridden roads. And though the Carters have obviously withstood them, it never stopped the rumor mills from spinning with attempts to creep into their private life. Namely, cheating scandals, pregnancy hoaxes and whispers of divorce have been abundant among the public, of which Bey and Jay may thinly address via lyricism — if the chatterboxes are lucky enough.  On their anniversary day of April 4, the day that the couple marks another successful year as Mr. and Mrs. Carter, we celebrate the unbreakable, unshakable, undeniable forces of Black love the Carter way.

Selena Gomez checked into a treatment center, and RadarOnline.com has the exclusive details about her latest rehab stint.  Justin Bieber’s 25-year-old girlfriend spent the last two weeks of January in a New York area treatment center and a source explained that those close to her were afraid of a drug relapse.  “Selena’s inner circle is afraid she is back on drugs and racing toward a breakdown,” the insider told Radar.  The singer’s party lifestyle was enabled by her boyfriend, the informant claimed.  “The label just gave her another huge advance which, mixed with Justin’s resources — he’s covering her security and transportation — has led to some pretty heavy partying…even for her.”  Gomez cut off her mother, Mandy Teefey, in the middle of her latest breakdown.  “Selena changed her number again in an effort to avoid Mandy. Mandy is now speaking to Selena through Justin and his mother,” the insider snitched to Radar.  Another source revealed Gomez sought treatment for “depression and anxiety.”  “Selena doesn’t want to fall back into her old ways,” the insider said. “She wants to be proactive about staying healthy.”  As Radar previously reported, Gomez checked into rehab in 2016 to battle her demons.  An insider revealed that Gomez had begun using a potentially deadly cocktail of “Lunesta, Ambien, Klonopin and Xanax” before loved ones staged a desperate intervention and checked her into rehab.  “Everyone close to her is worried because she seems to be back to old behavior,” said the source of Gomez, who also did a previous stint in treatment back in 2014.

The 18-year-old posed for the cover of the August issue of Allure magazine, and in addition to sitting down for a traditional celebrity profile, Kylie also opened up honestly to her big sister about her biggest beauty regret in a playful one-on-one.  'I definitely made my lips a little too big at one point,' she said. 'I got excited and felt like I needed to do a lot. And then you guys were like, ""Kylie, you need to chill."" And then I had to go back and have it fixed, and it was a crazy process. Thank God I didn't end up on Botched.'  Scroll down for video  Sharing the details: Kylie Jenner covers the August issue of Allure magazine and sat down for two separate interviews  Reel it in! She admitted that she went to far when she first started injecting her lips (pictured in August 2014)  Just like Kylie: These days, her lips are smaller and have become of the envy of fans everywhere  Beauty!!!! @kyliejenner @allure #augustissue #proudmama #allure A photo posted by Kris Jenner (@krisjenner) on Jul 13, 2016 at 12:26pm PDT  Rumors first started to swirl that Kylie was surgically enhancing her lips in 2014. Back then, people couldn't get enough of her suddenly-bigger pout, but it became a bit of a punchline as fans and critics alike criticized her for going to far.  Of course, few people are laughing now. After toning it down, Kylie's lips have become practically iconic — and have helped her grow her hugely successful Lip Kit brand, which even Kim says she has to beg to get her hands on.  'I don't think I've ever gotten more requests for anything than the Lip Kits. I have to finagle some out of Mom just to keep people happy,' she told Kylie in the interview. 'It's so crazy. I'm so happy [for you]...and I want to come over for dinner!'  Money makers: They've helped her grow her Lip Kit line into a hugely successful business  She sat down with big sister Kim Kardashian for a one-on-one talk, featured on the magazine's website  When she made her lips 'too big', her sisters had to convince her to relax with the fillers, and she eventually found the right size  Nothing lasts forever: Kylie said she likes Juvéderm because it's not permanent; she has to come back every two to four months but can let her lips go back to their natural size (left) if she changes her mind  Kylie has spoken out about her lip regrets in the past, telling the New York Times in September that she was overenthusiastic when she first got hooked on injectables.  Luckily, though, she soon found Dr.[Simon Ourian in Beverly Hills, whom she now relies on to keep her lips full and pillowy because 'he's super natural about it'.  'I still do Juvéderm for my lips,' she said, referring the to name-brand filler that is mostly made up of hyaluronic acid, a substance that the body does, in fact, produce naturally in limited amounts.  '[Dr. Ourian's] the best,' she added. 'I was going to somebody before, and it was just looking crazy.  'I would recommend that anyone who gets it done go for a filler that lasts only two to four months. It’s annoying to keep going back, but you have the option of stopping it.'  So natural: The reality star hit the beach to pose for her Allure photoshoot  The 18-year-old said Dr. Simon Ourian's technique is much more natural than that of the doctor she saw when she first started getting fillers  Imperfect pout: Kylie, pictured in 2011 before she had her lips enhanced, initially denied claims that she was using fillers to plump up her pout  Hanging with the ladies: Dr. Ourian (left) has been a Kardashian-Jenner go-to  But though Kylie's Allure cover story touches on her beauty secrets, the interview also delves into deeper subjects, like how proud the teenager is of her dad, who has become a role model for so many people.  Kylie explained that when Caitlyn finally told the family that she was transgender, it wasn't a major shock to her and Kendall, who — on more than one occasion — ran into their dad 'fully dressed in women's clothes'.  When she did break the news, Caitlyn was concerned about how her transition might negatively impact her kids, and even embarrass them — but Kylie put her at ease.  'I just told Caitlyn, ""You should do what you want in your life."" I'm just happy that she can live her life as herself now,' Kylie said.  Last laugh: Though people made fun of her lips at first, she's become an influential force in the beauty world  Kylie said she is happy her dad Caitlyn can live her life now, and noted how many trans people look up to her  Goofing off: In a behind-the-scenes video from Kylie's photoshoot, she's seen having fun between shots  A quiet life: Kylie revealed that one day she plans to step away from being famous  However, she also admitted that she didn't know a life that wasn't in front of the cameras  'A lot of young transgender people look up to [Caitlyn], and she's doing a lot [to educate people] around the world,' she went on. 'All she cares about is helping other people who are going through the same thing.'  While the family fame has given Caitlyn that opportunity to reach so many people, however, Kylie herself insisted she doesn't plan to be in the pubic eye her whole life — even though she's never lived any other way until now.",fake

Jones has been a featured performer at the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal and the Aspen Comedy Festival. In 2010, her one-hour comedy special, Problem Child, was broadcast on Showtime. Jones starred in Ghostbusters (2016) as Patty Tolan. In 2017 and 2018, Jones was nominated for an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on Saturday Night Live.  Early life [ edit ]  Annette Jones was born on September 7, 1967, in Memphis, Tennessee.[3] Her father was in the United States Army, and her family moved frequently.[4] Her family moved to Los Angeles, when her father took a job at Stevie Wonder's radio station, KJLH, as an electronics engineer.[3] Jones attended high school in Lynwood, California, where she also played basketball; her father suggested that she play the sport because she is six feet tall.[5]  Jones attended Chapman University on a basketball scholarship and transferred to Colorado State University when her coach Brian Berger left Chapman for Colorado State.[1][6][7] She intended to become a lawyer,[8] but changed her mind and changed her major a few times, including to business accounting and computer science, and ended up majoring in communications.[9] At Chapman, Jones became a radio DJ.[9] She was unsure of what she wanted to do and contemplated the possibility of a career playing basketball overseas.[8]  She had a brother, Rodney Keith Jones (1971–2009).[citation needed][10]  Career [ edit ]  Jones started to do stand-up comedy in college in 1987, when a friend signed her up for a ""Funniest Person on Campus"" contest.[4][8] After she won the contest, Jones left school and moved to Los Angeles.[8] She performed at regular clubs and worked at Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles and UPS[11] to make ends meet. Mother Love and Dave Chappelle encouraged her to move to New York City to hone her craft for two years, where she appeared on BET's ComicView before returning to Los Angeles.[9] She performed at The Comedy Store in West Hollywood, but received unfavorable reviews.[9] She opened for Jamie Foxx and was booed by the audience. Feeling she lacked experience, Jones stopped performing for three years.[9] Fearing that she would only ever be known in African American circles around 2010 she began to stop playing so called ""black clubs""[12] One night Chris Rock saw her perform and gave her name to several of ""the biggest managers in comedy"" all of whom ""didn't get it.""[13] Rock would eventually help Jones get a job at Saturday Night Live.[13]  In 2008, Jones was part of Katt Williams's It's Pimpin' Pimpin' tour.[4][14]  Netflix signed Jones for a stand-up special slated for 2020.[15]  Saturday Night Live [ edit ]  In December 2013, Saturday Night Live held a casting call to add at least one African-American woman to the show, and Jones auditioned. Prior to being asked to audition, Jones had criticized the show, saying that the show, and especially cast member Kenan Thompson, was ""not funny"".[16] Sasheer Zamata was added as a featured player, while Jones and LaKendra Tookes were hired as writers.[17] Jones appeared during the Weekend Update segment of the May 3, 2014 episode hosted by Andrew Garfield, where her jokes about her current dating problems and her potential effectiveness as a breeding slave were met with controversy.[6][18]  Jones appeared in the first and third episodes of the 40th season, hosted by Chris Pratt and Bill Hader, respectively. On October 20, 2014, Jones was promoted to the cast as a featured player, and made her official debut on the October 25, 2014 episode hosted by Jim Carrey. She became, at the age of 47, the oldest person to join the show as a cast member (surpassing Michael McKean and George Coe, who were 46 when they joined the show in 1994 and 1975, respectively).[19][20] Jones's addition marked the first time in SNL history that the show's cast included more than one African-American woman; in addition, the 40th season had the most African-American cast members to date.[21] Jones subsequently returned for Seasons 41, 42 (where she was promoted to Repertory Status), 43, and 44.  In 2017 and 2018, Jones was nominated for a Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on SNL.  Jones did not return to the 45th season, making the 44th season her last season.[22]  Film [ edit ]  In 2006, Jones appeared in Master P's movie Repos.  In 2014, Jones appeared in Chris Rock's directorial debut, Top Five; Rock has said a follow-up is in the works,[23] telling Complex Magazine, ""Some people really shine in Top Five. You might want to see a little more Leslie Jones.""[24]  In 2015, Jones appeared in the Judd Apatow and Amy Schumer project, Trainwreck; reportedly Apatow and Schumer wrote a part specifically for Jones after seeing her turn in Top Five.[25]  In 2016, she starred in the reboot Ghostbusters as Patty Tolan, alongside Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, and Kate McKinnon.[6][26]  Jones is set to star in Coming 2 America alongside Tracy Morgan, Rick Ross, and KiKi Layne. The film is a sequel to Coming to America, starring Eddie Murphy.[27]  Olympics [ edit ]  During the 2016 olympic games in Rio, Jones[28] regularly live-tweeted events and posted videos of her reactions.[29] Enthusiasm for Jones's commentary grew, with articles appearing like The Huffington Post's ""Watching Leslie Jones Watch The Olympics Is Better Than The Actual Olympics"".[30] Television producer Mike Shoemaker, one of Jones's Twitter followers, posted on Twitter that his friend Jim Bell, NBC's executive producer of the network's Olympics coverage, should add Jones to NBC's team of commentators covering the Games; Bell responded on Twitter the next day asking Jones to join NBC in Rio. She accepted and flew to Rio, covering swimming, track and field, gymnastics, and beach volleyball for NBC.[31]  Jones reprised her duties at the 2018 Winter Olympics.[32]  Other projects [ edit ]  Jones and fellow comedian Adam DeVine appeared in a 2016 ad campaign for Allstate Insurance, created by Leo Burnett Worldwide.[33]  Jones hosted the BET Awards on June 25, 2017.[34] This marked her hosting debut.  In 2018, Jones appeared in two advertisements for Amazon's Echo Spot.[35]  Sports fandom [ edit ]  Jones is a fan of the MLS team Seattle Sounders FC.[36]  Influences [ edit ]  Jones has cited as her comedic influences Eddie Murphy,[8] Richard Pryor,[4] Carol Burnett,[37] Lucille Ball,[37] John Ritter,[37] and Whoopi Goldberg.[4]  Online attacks [ edit ]  Following the release of Ghostbusters, Jones became the target of racist attacks by numerous accounts on social networking site Twitter. Twitter responded by taking action against several users, resulting in the permanent Twitter suspension of user and Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos, who had described her as ""barely literate"".[38]  After continuing to receive racist comments, Jones left Twitter on July 18, 2016.[39] Jones appeared later in the week on Late Night with Seth Meyers, in which she described the ordeal and her meeting with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Responding to Yiannopoulos's claim that he was targeted for being a ""gay conservative"", Jones stated, ""Free speech and hate speech [are] two different things"".[40]  Nearly a month later, Jones was again the subject of numerous online attacks. Her personal website was hacked, with its contents being replaced by photos of her driver's license and passport.[41] The site was changed to display alleged nude photographs of Jones, as well as a video tribute to Harambe, the Cincinnati Zoo gorilla killed in May 2016 (a reference to the racially charged gorilla remarks directed at Jones in the earlier attack). Jones' team took the website down shortly after it was hacked.[42]  Both incidents resulted in large outpourings of celebrity and fan support, via the hashtag ""#LoveForLeslieJ"", which trended on both Twitter and Instagram.[43] Paul Feig,[44] Gabourey Sidibe, Ellen DeGeneres, Sara Benincasa, Ava DuVernay, Hillary Clinton, Corey Taylor,[45] Katy Perry, Octavia Spencer, Anna Kendrick, Lena Dunham[46] and Loni Love expressed solidarity with Jones. Jones responded to the hacks on the October 22, 2016, episode of Saturday Night Live.[47]  Filmography [ edit ]  Film [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]",fake

4712,"Despite being just 20 years old, Kylie Jenner has been the subject of much speculation about whether or not she’s had plastic surgery. At last count, it’s been five years since the world became obsessed with Kylie’s lips. Some of her fans even tried using a lip-enhancing tool to get a Jenner-sized pout. (Spoiler: the #KylieJennerLipChallenge did not end well.) For a long time, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star denied getting injections, instead claiming that she had been over lining her lips. However, she recently came clean about the lip fillers, explaining that she’s been having them done for five years. This got us thinking: What else has Kylie had done that she hasn’t told us about? Here, plastic surgeon Dr Andrea Giannitrapani from MYA gives his professional opinion on the procedures Kylie Jenner miiiight have had done.  Lips  So, Kylie’s lips are no longer a mystery: She’s definitely had them done. On a recent episode of Life of Kylie, she opened up about why she got them done:  “I was 15 and I was insecure about my lips. I have really small lips. And it was like one of my first kisses and a guy was like, ‘I didn’t think you would be a good kisser because you have such small lips.’ I took that really hard. When a guy you like says that, I don’t know, it just really affected me. I just didn’t feel desirable or pretty. “I would overline my lips with the lip liner to create the illusion of bigger lips and then, finally, I was like, this lip liner isn't doing it and ended up getting my lips done.”  Breasts  In 2015, Kylie posted on her app, telling her fans that the secret to her new, bigger boobs was a Victoria’s Secret bra. “Everyone thinks I’ve gotten a breast augmentation recently and I haven’t.” She adds, “I just use the ‘Bombsh ell’ by Victoria’s Secret – it’s life-changing. I’ve gotten all my sisters on it, all my friends and if you ever want the look of bigger breasts, that’s what I do.”  Referring to the above images, Dr Giannitrapani thinks that Kylie has probably had breast augmentation. “There is a clear size increase to Kylie’s breasts looking at the side profile of these comparison pictures,” he said. “Although they are not out of proportion with her frame, they have the characteristics of a breast enlargement in the early stages of healing and look as though they still need time to settle.” “If she intended on keeping the procedure a secret, the surgeon will have gone for an implant size to suit her frame and for the result to look as natural as possible whilst still creating the volume increase she desired.”  Curves",fake
79,"LONDON — People around the world — from celebrity Kim Kardashian to regular folks — rushed to congratulate Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle on their engagement Monday. But many here, where the royal family resides, reacted in British ho-hum fashion.  ""I'm happy for the geezer, but I don't care,"" John Hedge, 42, said on a street in Streatham, a mixed-income neighborhood in south London.  That low-key response, expressed by others in the British capital, matched the way Harry said he popped the big question: while they were cooking a roast chicken during a ""standard, typical night"" at their cottage on the grounds of Kensington Palace.  ""Not interested,"" said Tony Jones, a commuter rushing to a train at London's Victoria station Monday evening.  Other Britons took to social media to ask whether the engagement would mean an extra day off — it won't. ""Give us the bank holiday or else,"" wrote Owen Jones, a left-wing newspaper columnist who believes the monarchy should be abolished.  Prime Minister Theresa May's office said the wedding day — sometime in the spring — will not be a national holiday, in contrast to the 2011 nuptials of Harry's older brother and future king, Prince William and Duchess Kate.  More:Palace: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announce engagement  More:Prince Harry: Princess Diana 'would be over the moon'  ""Me thinking about the monarchy on a normal day V me realising we might get a bank holiday for the Royal Wedding,"" said a Twitter user with the handle @Gamble1878. Posted with the tweet was a picture of a protester holding a sign that said ""down with the monarchy"" next to a separate image of a man dressed in a suit emblazoned with the Union Jack, the flag of the United Kingdom.  Others were more upbeat, despite what some described as ""royal wedding and baby fatigue,"" referring to William and Kate's marriage and their two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, with a third on the way.  ""I love Harry,"" said carpenter Jerry Walsh, 61, outside a pub in south London. ""He's the most natural of them (the royal family). They can do their own thing — let them live their lives. She's a beautiful girl — good luck to them. When his mum (Princess Diana) died, I felt for them.""

""She's very nice — she's a beautiful woman,"" she added about Markle, 36, a Los Angeles native who met Harry, 33, last year when he launched the Invictus Games in Toronto, where her TV show Suits is filmed.  ""I'm happy,"" said Kathleen Connell, 78, adding that Markle is ""different from everyone else.""  ""It's fantastic,"" she added.  Reaction outside Buckingham Palace, a top draw for tourists worldwide, was also relatively low-key.  ""I think it's perfectly fine for her to marry into the royal family,"" said Kieran Verseim, a medical lab technician from Denver. ""Anybody should be able to chose who they want to marry regardless of background,"" she said.  Markle, who is biracial, will be the first non-white person to marry into the royal family in modern history, a fact that sparked debate about interracial marriages in the United Kingdom. About 1 in every 10 people are in racially mixed relationships in the U.K., according to the latest census data.  ""We don't know too much about the royal family in Turkey,"" said Tarik Dogan, 42, an engineer from Istanbul as he marveled at the queen's official residence.  ""The little ones, the children, they are sweet,"" he added, referring to Prince George and Princess Charlotte.  Unlike some locals, the tourism industry reacted with glee about the next royal wedding. Visit London, the official city guide, congratulated Harry and Meghan and said the royal family are ""so important for tourism in London.""  Tourism across the U.K. linked to the royal family generates more than $666 million a year and attracts more than 2.7 million visitors, according to Visit London.

For the Swiss company, see ShapeShift  ""Shapeshifter"" redirects here. For other uses, see Shapeshifter (disambiguation)  The ability to physically transform through an inherent ability, divine intervention or generic tendencies  ""The giant Galligantua and the wicked old magician transform the duke's daughter into a white hind ."" by Arthur Rackham  In mythology, folklore and speculative fiction, shapeshifting is the ability to physically transform through an inherently superhuman ability, divine intervention, demonic manipulation, sorcery, spells or having inherited the ability. The idea of shapeshifting is in the oldest forms of totemism and shamanism, as well as the oldest existant literature and epic poems such as the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Iliad. The concept remains a common trope in conspiracy theories, modern fantasy, children's literature and popular culture.  Folklore and mythology [ edit ]  1722 German woodcut of a werewolf transforming  Popular shapeshifting creatures in folklore are werewolves and vampires (mostly of European, Canadian, and Native American/early American origin), the huli jing of East Asia (including the Japanese kitsune and Korean kumiho), and the gods, goddesses, and demons of numerous mythologies, such as the Norse Loki or the Greek Proteus. Shapeshifting to the form of a wolf is specifically known as lycanthropy, and such creatures who undergo such change are called lycanthropes. Therianthropy is the more general term for human-animal shifts, but it is rarely used in that capacity. It was also common for deities to transform mortals into animals and plants.  Other terms for shapeshifters include metamorph, the Navajo skin-walker, mimic, and therianthrope. The prefix ""were-,"" coming from the Old English word for ""man"" (masculine rather than generic), is also used to designate shapeshifters; despite its root, it is used to indicate female shapeshifters as well.  While the popular idea of a shapeshifter is of a human being who turns into something else, there are numerous stories about animals that can transform themselves as well.[1]  Examples of shapeshifting in classical literature include many examples in Ovid's Metamorphoses, Circe's transforming of Odysseus' men to pigs in Homer's The Odyssey, and Apuleius's Lucius becoming a donkey in The Golden Ass. Proteus was noted among the gods for his shapeshifting; both Menelaus and Aristaeus seized him to win information from him, and succeeded only because they held on during his various changes. Nereus told Heracles where to find the Apples of the Hesperides for the same reason.  The Titan Metis, the first wife of Zeus and the mother of the goddess Athena, was believed to be able to change her appearance into anything she wanted. In one story, she was so proud, that her husband, Zeus, tricked her into changing into a fly. He then swallowed her because he feared that he and Metis would have a son who would be more powerful than Zeus himself. Metis, however, was already pregnant. She stayed alive inside his head and built armor for her daughter. The banging of her metalworking made Zeus have a headache, so Hephaestus clove his head with an axe. Athena sprang from her father's head, fully grown, and in battle armor.  In Greek mythology, the transformation is often a punishment from the gods to humans who crossed them.  Zeus transformed King Lycaon and his children into wolves (hence lycanthropy) as a punishment for either killing Zeus' children or serving him the flesh of Lycaon's own murdered son Nyctimus, depending on the exact version of the myth.  Ares assigned Alectryon to keep watch for the other gods during his affair with Aphrodite, but Alectryon fell asleep, leading to their discovery and humiliation that morning. Ares turned Alectryon into a rooster, which always crows to signal the morning.  Demeter transformed Ascalabus into a lizard for mocking her sorrow and thirst during her search for her daughter Persephone. She also turned King Lyncus into a lynx for trying to murder her prophet Triptolemus.  Athena transformed Arachne into a spider for challenging her as a weaver and/or weaving a tapestry that insulted the gods. She also turned Nyctimene into an owl, though in this case it was an act of mercy, as the girl wished to hide from the daylight out of shame from being raped by her father.  Artemis transformed Actaeon into a stag for spying on her bathing, and he was later devoured by his own hunting dogs.  Galanthis was transformed into a weasel or cat after interfering in Hera's plans to hinder the birth of Heracles.  Atalanta and Hippomenes were turned into lions after making love in a temple dedicated to Zeus or Cybele.  Io was a priestess of Hera in Argos, a nymph who was raped by Zeus, who changed her into a heifer to escape detection.  Hera punished young Tiresias by transforming him into a woman and, seven years later, back into a man.  King Tereus, his wife Procne and her sister Philomela were all turned into birds (a hoopoe, a swallow and a nightingale respectively), after Tereus raped Philomela and cut out her tongue, and in revenge she and Procne served him the flesh of his murdered son Itys.  While the Greek gods could use transformation punitively – such as Medusa, turned to a monster for having sexual intercourse with Poseidon in Athena's temple – even more frequently, the tales using it are of amorous adventure. Zeus repeatedly transformed himself to approach mortals as a means of gaining access:[2]  Danaë as a shower of gold  Europa as a bull  Leda as a swan  Ganymede, as an eagle  Alcmene as her husband Amphitryon  Hera as a cuckoo  Leto as a quail  Semele as a mortal shepherd  Io, as a cloud  Nemesis (Goddess of retribution) transformed into a goose to escape Zeus' advances, but he turned into a swan. She later bore the egg in which Helen of Troy was found.  Vertumnus transformed himself into an old woman to gain entry to Pomona's orchard; there, he persuaded her to marry him.  In other tales, the woman appealed to other gods to protect her from rape, and was transformed (Daphne into laurel, Cornix into a crow). Unlike Zeus and other gods' shapeshifting, these women were permanently metamorphosed.  In one tale, Demeter transformed herself into a mare to escape Poseidon, but Poseidon counter-transformed himself into a stallion to pursue her, and succeeded in the rape. Caenis, having been raped by Poseidon, demanded of him that she be changed to a man. He agreed, and she became Caeneus, a form he never lost, except, in some versions, upon death.  As a final reward from the gods for their hospitality, Baucis and Philemon were transformed, at their deaths, into a pair of trees.  In some variants of the tale of Narcissus, he is turned into a narcissus flower.  Sometimes metamorphoses transformed objects into humans. In the myths of both Jason and Cadmus, one task set to the hero was to sow dragon's teeth; on being sown, they would metamorphose into belligerent warriors, and both heroes had to throw a rock to trick them into fighting each other to survive. Deucalion and Pyrrha repopulated the world after a flood by throwing stones behind them; they were transformed into people. Cadmus is also often known to have transformed into a dragon or serpent towards the end of his life. Pygmalion fell in love with Galatea, a statue he had made. Aphrodite had pity on him and transformed the stone to a living woman.  British and Irish [ edit ]  Fairies, witches, and wizards were all noted for their shapeshifting ability. Not all fairies could shapeshift, and some were limited to changing their size, as with the spriggans, and others to a few forms and other fairies might have only the appearance of shapeshifting, through their power, called ""glamour,"" to create illusions.[3] But others, such as the Hedley Kow, could change to many forms, and both human and supernatural wizards were capable of both such changes, and inflicting them on others.[4]  Witches could turn into hares and in that form steal milk and butter.[5]  Many British fairy tales, such as Jack the Giant Killer and The Black Bull of Norroway, feature shapeshifting.  Celtic mythology [ edit ]  Pwyll was transformed by Arawn into Arawn's own shape, and Arawn transformed himself into Pwyll's, so that they could trade places for a year and a day.  Llwyd ap Cil Coed transformed his wife and attendants into mice to attack a crop in revenge; when his wife is captured, he turned himself into three clergymen in succession to try to pay a ransom.  Math fab Mathonwy and Gwydion transform flowers into a woman named Blodeuwedd, and when she betrays her husband Lleu Llaw Gyffes, who is transformed into an eagle, they transform her again, into an owl.  Gilfaethwy committed rape with help from his brother Gwydion. Both were transformed into animals, for one year each. Gwydion was transformed into a stag, sow and wolf, and Gilfaethwy into a hind, boar and she-wolf. Each year, they had a child. Math turned the three young animals into boys.  Gwion, having accidentally taken some of the wisdom potion that Ceridwen was brewing for her son, fled from her through a succession of changes that she answered with changes of her own, ending with his being eaten, a grain of corn, by her as a hen. She became pregnant, and he was reborn in a new form, as Taliesin.  Tales abound about the selkie, a seal that can remove its skin to make contact with humans for only a short amount of time before it must return to the sea. Clan MacColdrum of Uist's foundation myths include a union between the founder of the clan and a shapeshifting selkie.[6] Another such creature is the Scottish selkie, which needs its sealskin to regain its form. In The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry the (male) selkie seduces a human woman. Such stories surrounding these creatures are usually romantic tragedies.  Scottish mythology features shapeshifters, which allows the various creatures to trick, deceive, hunt, and kill humans. Water spirits such as the each-uisge, which inhabit lochs and waterways in Scotland, were said to appear as a horse or a young man.[4] Other tales include kelpies who emerge from lochs and rivers in the disguise of a horse or woman in order to ensnare and kill weary travelers. Tam Lin, a man captured by the Queen of the Fairies is changed into all manner of beasts before being rescued. He finally turned into a burning coal and was thrown into a well, whereupon he reappeared in his human form. The motif of capturing a person by holding him through all forms of transformation is a common thread in folktales.[7]  Perhaps the best-known Irish myth is that of Aoife who turned her stepchildren, the Children of Lir, into swans to be rid of them. Likewise, in the Tochmarc Étaíne, Fuamnach jealously turns Étaín into a butterfly. The most dramatic example of shapeshifting in Irish myth is that of Tuan mac Cairill, the only survivor of Partholón's settlement of Ireland. In his centuries long life he became successively a stag, a wild boar, a hawk and finally a salmon prior to being eaten and (as in the Wooing of Étaín) reborn as a human.  The Púca is a Celtic faery, and also a deft shapeshifter. He can transform into many different, terrifying forms.  Sadhbh, the wife of the famous hero Fionn mac Cumhaill, was changed into a deer by the druid Fer Doirich when she spurned his amorous interests.  Norse [ edit ]  In the Lokasenna, Odin and Loki taunt each other with having taken the form of females and nursing offspring to which they had given birth. A 13th-century Edda relates Loki taking the form of a mare to bear Odin's steed Sleipnir which was the fastest horse ever to exist, and also the form of a she-wolf to bear Fenrir.[8]  Svipdagr angered Odin, who turned him into a dragon. Despite his monstrous appearance, his lover, the goddess Freyja, refused to leave his side. When the warrior Hadding found and slew Svipdagr, Freyja cursed him to be tormented by a tempest and shunned like the plague wherever he went.[citation needed] In the Hyndluljóð, Freyja transformed her protégé Óttar into a boar to conceal him. She also possessed a cloak of falcon feathers that allowed her to transform into a falcon, which Loki borrowed on occasion.  The Volsunga saga contains many shapeshifting characters. Siggeir's mother changed into a wolf to help torture his defeated brothers-in-law with slow and ignominious deaths. When one, Sigmund, survived, he and his nephew and son Sinfjötli killed men wearing wolfskins; when they donned the skins themselves, they were cursed to become werewolves.  The dwarf Andvari is described as being able to magically turn into a pike. Alberich, his counterpart in Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, using the Tarnhelm, takes on many forms, including a giant serpent and a toad, in a failed attempt to impress or intimidate Loki and Odin/Wotan.  Fafnir was originally a dwarf, a giant or even a human, depending on the exact myth, but in all variants he transformed into a dragon—a symbol of greed—while guarding his ill-gotten hoard. His brother, Ótr, enjoyed spending time as an otter, which led to his accidental slaying by Loki.  In Scandinavia, there existed, for example, the famous race of she-werewolves known with a name of Maras, women who took on the appearance of the night looking for huge half-human and half-wolf monsters. If a female at midnight stretches the membrane which envelopes the foal when it is brought forth, between four sticks and creeps through it, naked, she will bear children without pain; but all the boys will be shamans, and all the girls Maras.[citation needed]  The Nisse is sometimes said to be a shapeshifter. This trait also is attributed to Huldra.  Gunnhild, Mother of Kings (Gunnhild konungamóðir) (c. 910 – c. 980), a quasi-historical figure who appears in the Icelandic Sagas, according to which she was the wife of Eric Bloodaxe, was credited with magic powers - including the power of shapeshifting and turning at will into a bird. She is the central character of the novel Mother of Kings by Poul Anderson,[9] which considerably elaborates on her shapeshifting abilities.  Other lore [ edit ]  Armenian [ edit ]  In Armenian mythology, shapeshifters include the Nhang, a serpentine river monster than can transform itself into a woman or seal, and will drown humans and then drink their blood; or the beneficial Shahapet, a guardian spirit that can appear either as a man or a snake.[10]  Indian [ edit ]  Ancient Indian mythology tells of Nāga, snakes that can sometimes assume human form. Scriptures describe shapeshifting Rakshasa (demons) assuming animal forms to deceive humans. The Ramayana also includes the Vanara, a group of apelike humanoids who possessed supernatural powers and could change their shapes.[11][12]  In the Indian fable The Dog Bride from Folklore of the Santal Parganas by Cecil Henry Bompas, a buffalo herder falls in love with a dog that has the power to turn into a woman when she bathes.  Philippines [ edit ]  Philippine mythology includes the Aswang, a vampiric monster capable of transforming into a bat, a large black dog, a black cat, a black boar or some other form in order to stalk humans at night. The folklore also mentions other beings such as the Kapre, the Tikbalang and the Engkanto, which change their appearances to woo beautiful maidens. Also, talismans (called ""anting-anting"" or ""birtud"" in the local dialect), can give their owners the ability to shapeshift. In one tale, Chonguita the Monkey Wife,[14] a woman is turned into a monkey, only becoming human again if she can marry a handsome man.  Tatar [ edit ]  Tatar folklore includes Yuxa, a hundred-year-old snake that can transform itself into a beautiful young woman, and seeks to marry men in order to have children.  ""Madame White Snake"" Picture on long veranda in the Summer Palace , Beijing, China  Chinese [ edit ]  Chinese mythology contains many tales of animal shapeshifters, capable of taking on human form. The most common such shapeshifter is the huli jing, a fox spirit which usually appears as a beautiful young woman; most are dangerous, but some feature as the heroines of love stories. Madame White Snake is one such legend; a snake falls in love with a man, and the story recounts the trials that she and her husband faced.  Japanese [ edit ]  Kuzunoha the fox woman, casting a fox shadow  In Japanese folklore ōbake are a type of yōkai with the ability to shapeshift. The fox, or kitsune is among the most commonly known, but other such creatures include the bakeneko, the mujina and the tanuki.  Korean [ edit ]  Korean mythology also contains a fox with the ability to shapeshift. Unlike its Chinese and Japanese counterparts, the kumiho is always malevolent. Usually its form is of a beautiful young woman; one tale recounts a man, a would-be seducer, revealed as a kumiho.[15] The kumiho has nine tails and as she desires to be a full human, she uses her beauty to seduce men and eat their hearts (or in some cases livers where the belief is that 100 livers would turn her into a real human).  Somali [ edit ]  In Somali mythology Qori ismaris (""One who rubs himself with a stick"") was a man who could transform himself into a ""Hyena-man"" by rubbing himself with a magic stick at nightfall and by repeating this process could return to his human state before dawn.  Trinidad and Tobago [ edit ]  The Ligahoo or loup-garou is the shapeshifter of Trinidad and Tobago's folklore. This unique ability is believed to be handed down in some old creole families, and is usually associated with witch-doctors and practitioners of African magic.[16] [17]  Mapuche (Argentina and Chile) [ edit ]  The name of the Nahuel Huapi Lake in Argentina derives from the toponym of its major island in Mapudungun (Mapuche language): ""Island of the Jaguar (or Puma)"", from nahuel, ""puma (or jaguar)"", and huapí, ""island"". There is, however, more to the word ""Nahuel"" - it can also signify ""a man who by sorcery has been transformed into a puma"" (or jaguar).  Folktales [ edit ]  Themes [ edit ]  Shapeshifting may be used as a plot device, such as when Puss in Boots in the fairy tales tricks the ogre into becoming a mouse to be eaten. Shapeshifting may also include symbolic significance, like the Beast's transformation in Beauty and the Beast indicates Belle's ability to accept him despite his appearance.  When a form is taken on involuntarily, the thematic effect can be one of confinement and restraint; the person is bound to the new form. In extreme cases, such as petrifaction, the character is entirely disabled. On the other hand, voluntary shapeshifting can be a means of escape and liberation. Even when the form is not undertaken to resemble a literal escape, the abilities specific to the form allow the character to act in a manner that was previously impossible.  Examples of this are in fairy tales. A prince who is forced into a bear's shape (as in East of the Sun and West of the Moon) is a prisoner, but a princess who takes on a bear's shape voluntarily to flee a situation (as in The She-Bear) escapes with her new shape.[22] In the Earthsea books, Ursula K. Le Guin depicts an animal form as slowly transforming the wizard's mind, so that the dolphin, bear or other creature forgets it was human, making it impossible to change back. This makes an example for a voluntary shapeshifting becoming an imprisoning metamorphosis. Beyond this, the uses of shapeshifting, transformation, and metamorphosis in fiction are as protean as the forms the characters take on. Some are rare, such as Italo Calvino's ""The Canary Prince"" is a Rapunzel variant in which shapeshifting is used to gain access to the tower.  Punitive changes [ edit ]  In many cases, imposed forms are punitive in nature. This may be a just punishment, the nature of the transformation matching the crime for which it occurs; in other cases, the form is unjustly imposed by an angry and powerful person. In fairy tales, such transformations are usually temporary, but they commonly appear as the resolution of myths (as in many of the Metamorphoses) or produce origin myths.  Transformation chase [ edit ]  In many fairy tales and ballads, as in Child Ballad #44, The Twa Magicians or Farmer Weathersky, a magical chase occurs where the pursued endlessly takes on forms in an effort to shake off the pursuer, and the pursuer answers with shapeshifting, as, a dove is answered with a hawk, and a hare with a greyhound. The pursued may finally succeed in escape or the pursuer in capturing.  The Grimm Brothers fairy tale Foundling-Bird contains this as the bulk of the plot.[24] In the Italian Campania Fables collection of Pentamerone by Gianbattista Basile, tells of a Neapolitan princess who, to escape from her father who had imprisoned her, becomes a huge she-bear. The magic happens due to a potion given to her by an old witch. The girl, once gone, can regain her human aspect.  In other variants, the pursued may transform various objects into obstacles, as in the fairy tale ""The Master Maid"", where the Master Maid transforms a wooden comb into a forest, a lump of salt into a mountain, and a flask of water into a sea. In these tales, the pursued normally escapes after overcoming three obstacles.[25] This obstacle chase is literally found worldwide, in many variants in every region.[26]  In fairy tales of the Aarne–Thompson type 313A, The Girl Helps the Hero Flee, such a chase is an integral part of the tale. It can be either a transformation chase (as in The Grateful Prince, King Kojata, Foundling-Bird, Jean, the Soldier, and Eulalie, the Devil's Daughter, or The Two Kings' Children) or an obstacle chase (as in The Battle of the Birds, The White Dove, or The Master Maid).[27]  In a similar effect, a captive may shapeshift in order to break a hold on him. Proteus and Nereus's shapeshifting was to prevent heroes such as Menelaus and Heracles from forcing information from them. Tam Lin, once seized by Janet, was transformed by the faeries to keep Janet from taking him, but as he had advised her, she did not let go, and so freed him.[29] The motif of capturing a person by holding him through many transformations is found in folktales throughout Europe,[7] and Patricia A. McKillip references it in her Riddle-Master trilogy: a shapeshifting Earthmaster finally wins its freedom by startling the man holding it.  Powers [ edit ]  One motif is a shape change in order to obtain abilities in the new form. Berserkers were held to change into wolves and bears in order to fight more effectively. In many cultures, evil magicians could transform into animal shapes and thus skulk about.  In many fairy tales, the hero's talking animal helper proves to be a shapeshifted human being, able to help him in its animal form. In one variation, featured in The Three Enchanted Princes and The Death of Koschei the Deathless, the hero's three sisters have been married to animals. These prove to be shapeshifted men, who aid their brother-in-law in a variant of tale types.[30]  In an early Mayan text, the Shapeshifter, or Mestaclocan, has the ability to change his appearance and to manipulate the minds of animals. In one tale, the Mestaclocan finds a dying eagle. Changing into the form of an eagle, he convinces the dying bird that it is, in fact, not dying. As the story goes they both soar into the heavens, and lived together for eternity.  Bildungsroman [ edit ]  Beauty and the Beast has been interpreted as a young woman's coming-of-age, in which she changes from being repulsed by sexual activity and regarding a husband therefore bestial, to a mature woman who can marry.  Needed items [ edit ]  Valkyries as swan maidens, having shed their swan skins.  Some shapeshifters are able to change form only if they have some item, usually an article of clothing. In Bisclavret by Marie de France, a werewolf cannot regain human form without his clothing, but in wolf form does no harm to anyone. The most common use of this motif, however, is in tales where a man steals the article and forces the shapeshifter, trapped in human form, to become his bride. This lasts until she discovers where he has hidden the article, and she can flee. Selkies feature in these tales. Others include swan maidens and the Japanese tennin.  Inner conflict [ edit ]  The power to externally transform can symbolize an internal savagery; a central theme in many strands of werewolf mythology, and the inversion of the ""liberation"" theme, as in Dr Jekyll's transformation into Mr. Hyde.  Usurpation [ edit ]  Sister Alenushka Weeping about Brother Ivanushka by Brother and Sister: Alenushka laments her brother's transformation into a goat. by Viktor Vasnetsov , Russian variant of: Alenushka laments her brother's transformation into a goat.  Some transformations are performed to remove the victim from his place, so that the transformer can usurp it. Bisclaveret's wife steals his clothing and traps him in wolf form because she has a lover. A witch, in The Wonderful Birch, changed a mother into a sheep to take her place, and had the mother slaughtered; when her stepdaughter married the king, the witch transformed her into a reindeer so as to put her daughter in the queen's place. In the Korean Transformation of the Kumiho, a kumiho, a fox with magical powers, transformed itself into an image of the bride, only being detected when her clothing is removed. In Brother and Sister, when two children flee from their cruel stepmother, she enchants the streams along the way to transform them. While the brother refrains from the first two, which threaten to turn them into tigers and wolves, he is too thirsty at the third, which turns him into a deer. The Six Swans are transformed into swans by their stepmother, as are the Children of Lir in Irish mythology.  Ill-advised wishes [ edit ]  Many fairy-tale characters have expressed ill-advised wishes to have any child at all, even one that has another form, and had such children born to them.[34] At the end of the fairy tale, normally after marriage, such children metamorphose into human form. Hans My Hedgehog was born when his father wished for a child, even a hedgehog. Even stranger forms are possible: Giambattista Basile included in his Pentamerone the tale of a girl born as a sprig of myrtle, and Italo Calvino, in his Italian Folktales, a girl born as an apple.  Sometimes, the parent who wishes for a child is told how to gain one, but does not obey the directions perfectly, resulting in the transformed birth. In Prince Lindworm, the woman eats two onions, but does not peel one, resulting in her first child being a lindworm. In Tatterhood, a woman magically produces two flowers, but disobeys the directions to eat only the beautiful one, resulting her having a beautiful and sweet daughter, but only after a disgusting and hideous one.  Less commonly, ill-advised wishes can transform a person after birth. The Seven Ravens are transformed when their father thinks his sons are playing instead of fetching water to christen their newborn and sickly sister, and curses them.[35] In Puddocky, when three princes start to quarrel over the beautiful heroine, a witch curses her because of the noise.  Monstrous bride/bridegroom [ edit ]  Such wished-for children may become monstrous brides or bridegrooms. These tales have often been interpreted as symbolically representing arranged marriages; the bride's revulsion to marrying a stranger being symbolized by his bestial form.[36]  The heroine must fall in love with the transformed groom. The hero or heroine must marry, as promised, and the monstrous form is removed by the wedding. Sir Gawain thus transformed the Loathly lady; although he was told that this was half-way, she could at his choice be beautiful by day and hideous by night, or vice versa, he told her that he would choose what she preferred, which broke the spell entirely. In Tatterhood, Tatterhood is transformed by her asking her bridegroom why he didn't ask her why she rode a goat, why she carried a spoon, and why she was so ugly, and when he asked her, denying it and therefore transforming her goat into a horse, her spoon into a fan, and herself into a beauty. Puddocky is transformed when her prince, after she had helped him with two other tasks, tells him that his father has sent him for a bride. A similar effect is found in Child ballad 34, Kemp Owyne, where the hero can transform a dragon back into a maiden by kissing her three times.  Sometimes the bridegroom removes his animal skin for the wedding night, whereupon it can be burned. Hans My Hedgehog, The Donkey and The Pig King fall under this grouping. At an extreme, in Prince Lindworm, the bride who avoids being eaten by the lindworm bridegroom arrives at her wedding wearing every gown she owns, and she tells the bridegroom she will remove one of hers if he removes one of his; only when her last gown comes off has he removed his last skin, and become a white shape that she can form into a man.[1]  In some tales, the hero or heroine must obey a prohibition; the bride must spend a period of time not seeing the transformed groom in human shape (as in East of the Sun and West of the Moon), or the bridegroom must not burn the animals' skins. In The Brown Bear of Norway, The Golden Crab, The Enchanted Snake and some variants of The Frog Princess, burning the skin is a catastrophe, putting the transformed bride or bridegroom in danger. In these tales, the prohibition is broken, invariably, resulting in a separation and a search by one spouse for the other.[1]  Death [ edit ]  Ghosts sometimes appear in animal form. In The Famous Flower of Serving-Men, the heroine's murdered husband appears to the king as a white dove, lamenting her fate over his own grave. In The White and the Black Bride and The Three Little Men in the Wood, the murdered – drowned – true bride reappears as a white duck. In The Rose Tree and The Juniper Tree, the murdered children become birds who avenge their own deaths. There are African folk tales of murder victims avenging themselves in the form of crocodiles that can shapeshift into human form.[39]  In some fairy tales, the character can reveal himself in every new form, and so a usurper repeatedly kills the victim in every new form, as in Beauty and Pock Face, A String of Pearls Twined with Golden Flowers, and The Boys with the Golden Stars. This eventually leads to a form in which the character (or characters) can reveal the truth to someone able to stop the villain.  Similarly, the transformation back may be acts that would be fatal. In The Wounded Lion, the prescription for turning the lion back into a prince was to kill him, chop him to pieces, burn the pieces, and throw the ash into water. Less drastic but no less apparently fatal, the fox in The Golden Bird, the foals in The Seven Foals, and the cats in Lord Peter and The White Cat tell the heroes of those stories to cut off their heads; this restores them to human shape.[40] In the Greek tale of Scylla, Scylla's father Nisus turns into an eagle after death and drowns her daughter for betraying her father.

1839,"The Boston Free Speech rally on Saturday has raised fears last weekend's white supremacist march on Charlottesville — and the ensuing violence — will play out in the Massachusetts capital, too. Groups of counter-protesters have gathered under a Fight Supremacy demonstration, including Antifa members, Black Lives Matter activists, and anti-racists across the board. But what does Fight Supremacy want, and what are their goals of the counter-protest?  Well, for starters, the Facebook page for the Fight Supremacy counter-protest has over 14,000 marked as attending. So, in this case, gathering a crowd isn't an issue. As for the protest's objective, organizers shared a handful of clear intentions on the page. Understandably, one of the main intentions is to combat any possible repeat of the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville by organizing a coalition to march against the hate groups. There can be safety, or at least, solidarity in greater numbers.  ""As we have seen with the events in Charlottesville and around the country, white nationalists are emboldened by the current political administration and growing police state. Rallies and marches organized by white supremacists are more prevalent than in recent years, and—as always—it is the most marginalized who are left vulnerable,"" read the Fight Supremacy event page.  In case violence breaks, the Boston Mayor Marty Walsh made it clear he's prepared to shut down the Free Speech rally. ""If anything gets out of hand, we will shut it down,” Walsh said at a news conference Friday. “We’re going to respect their right to free speech. In return, they must respect our city.""  In preparation, there are already 500 police officers deployed to keep the peace. Although, given the fact that police officers stood by while a 20-year-old black man was beaten by white supremacists last weekend, their presence means little to those who need protection the most.  By noon on Saturday, there were already thousands of Fight Supremacy protesters gathered, greatly outnumber the amount of white supremacists who showed up.  ""Resistance takes many forms. One of those forms is counter-protest. Counter-protests send a message to white supremacists that their hateful rhetoric, physical violence, and fear mongering will not go uncontested. It's also a show of solidarity and an opportunity for allies to ""show up"" and wield their privilege,"" wrote the Fight Supremacy mission statement.  Regardless of how the events continue to unfold throughout the remainder of Saturday, it appears that Fight Supremacy organizers have already successfully gathered thousands to counter white supremacists. And that's a feat for such short notice.",fake

3331,"Sage Steele, like many sports figures, found herself in the middle of the debate over Donald Trump’s new immigration policy over the weekend — and received a lot of backlash for her comments about the protests at airports.  From her Instagram post:  So THIS is why thousands of us dragged luggage nearly 2 miles to get to LAX, but still missed our flights. Fortunately, a 7 hour wait for the next flight to Houston won’t affect me that much, but my heart sank for the elderly and parents with small children who did their best to walk all that way but had no chance of making their flights. I love witnessing people exercise their right to protest! But it saddened me to see the joy on their faces knowing that they were successful in disrupting so many people’s travel plans. Yes, immigrants were affected by this as well. Brilliant. 🇺🇸  On Instagram, in an effort to stand up for the immigrants and refugees affected by the ban, many commentors criticized her for what they believed wasn’t seeing the bigger picture. Many also resorted to using slurs to describe the ESPN personality, which is really just a reminder that social media can be terrible all around.

8952,"In case you missed it, production on the popular “Bachelor” spinoff was shuttered in June after alleged “misconduct” took place during filming on set in Mexico. Producers did not elaborate, though within hours rumors were flying, namely that the situation involved two cast members; an incident in a pool; and “a drunk sexual encounter with a female contestant who may have been too intoxicated to consent,” according to reports.  AD  AD  Soon, it emerged the two contestants were Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson — Olympios, 24, hired a lawyer and called the incident her “worst nightmare.” Jackson, 30, said his character was being destroyed with “false claims and malicious allegations.” A couple of weeks later, production company Warner Bros. completed an investigation of the footage, and found it “does not support any charge of misconduct by a cast member.” Olympios’s own investigation was competed to her satisfaction. A few days later, filming resumed, though Olympios and Jackson did not return.  Even though the show went on, viewers were very aware of the fact that allegations occurred — ones that triggered the franchise to review its safety procedures. Yet before the premiere, producers appeared to treat the controversy as a harmless misstep, along with a cheery promo that some dubbed “horribly flippant.” (ABC Entertainment’s president, Channing Dungey, said they meant the trailer to be “cheeky,” and pulled them when it was clear that audiences weren’t amused.)  Before the premiere, the Hollywood Reporter published an interview with Robert Mills, head of ABC’s alternative programming, who said the show would address the controversy “head on.” According to THR, Monday’s episode would “air footage leading up to the shutdown, and Tuesday will see Chris Harrison hosting a ‘thought-provoking’ conversation with the cast about the show’s new rules and the topic of consent.”  However, if you didn’t read about this plan ahead of time, it sure looked like the show was tastelessly using the scandal as bait for fans to tune in to Tuesday’s episode — as evidenced by many frustrated tweets from viewers. And while cliffhangers are certainly a much-used part of “The Bachelor” formula, maybe this wasn’t the time or place for that strategy.  The beginning of the episode looked like it would be different, as it featured host Chris Harrison on an empty beach.  AD  AD  “As many of you already know, this was the season of ‘Paradise’ that looked like it might not happen. After two days of shooting, we decided to suspend production. Yes, there was trouble in paradise as accusations and allegations ran wild. It was an extraordinarily stressful and emotional time for our cast and all of our crew, including myself,” he said gravely.  Still, he added, the goal of “Paradise” is to help former “Bachelor” cast members find love. But first, the producers wanted to show everything that happened during the two days before production came to a halt. “Let’s get this season started, a season that I can definitely say will go down in ‘Bachelor’ history as the most shocking, and yes, the most dramatic season ever,” Harrison said, a wink to longtime viewers who know that’s promised every season.  So the show went on, as the contestants were introduced and started pairing off — a couple scenes showed DeMario and Corinne bonding. Eventually viewers saw them laughing together, with Corinne sitting on his lap. They ran over to the pool, yelling hello to fellow contestant Alex Woytkiw, who was conducting an on-camera interview.  AD  AD  “What’s going on with Corinne and DeMario, I don’t know. I know that they’re enjoying each other’s company. They seem like they are clicking,” Alex said, watching in amusement. ” ‘Paradise’ comes with potential to fall in love, and Corinne and DeMario are forging a relationship. They look like they have a connection.”  Alex continued to narrate as Corinne and DeMario jumped in the pool. “Just to let the viewers at home know, Corinne has not changed out of her clothing. She is fully dressed, in the pool right now with DeMario. This is so romantic. It is approximately 4:30 in the afternoon right now, and Corinne and DeMario are already attached at the hip,” he laughed.  That was the last time Corinne and DeMario were seen together on camera. Throughout the episode, there were multiple teasers about drama. “Stay tuned for the moment … the cameras stopped rolling,” a voice-over said mischievously.  Then, with about two minutes left in the show, the camera zoomed in on Corinne talking with Alex and another cast member, Amanda Stanton. A producer walked over. “Can I steal you for a minute?” he asked Corinne. Looking confused, Corinne stood up. Then they cut to another producer who found DeMario on the beach, walking with Alexis Waters. “I hate to do this, but I need him. I gotta talk to him in private,” the producer said.  AD  AD  “What the f— is going on?” Alexis asked.  There was no answer. The next two minutes were a blur of activity, with dramatic music playing in the background. The contestants talked over each other: “I think DeMario left.” “Where’s Corinne?” A producer marched over. “Shut it down!” he barked at a camera operator, who lowered his camera to the sand.  Things got blurry as other cameras were dramatically pointed to the ground, and the crew was ordered to stop filming. The cast grew increasingly confused. “I’m thinking it’s something with Corinne and DeMario from the first night,” one woman said in the background.  The contestants slowly packed up and headed back to their rooms. “It’s kind of like a chill fell over ‘Paradise,’” explained Danielle Maltby to the camera. “We’re just all looking at each other like, ‘What the f— is happening?’”  AD  AD  Eventually, viewers saw an empty beach as the spooky music continued, with a voice-over urging the audience to tune in on Tuesday night. A couple scenes showed the cast all gathered around Harrison saying sternly, “Do you want to be here?”  Obviously, there’s not much suspense — any “Paradise” viewer knows what happens next. And given the serious nature of the initial allegations, there was no reason not to explain everything upfront, no cliffhangers necessary.  Read more:",real
1222,"Beyoncé Rumored To Be Asking For Silent Delivery  As the countdown to Blueprint 1 and Blueprint 2’s arrival continues, the stories about Bey’s birth plans abound. First, we heard she planned to give birth at home, then they said her security has been running weekly drills to practice their approach to Cedars-Sinai and now there’s a report that Bey wants silence in the delivery room.  According to Naughty Gossip reports:  “Beyoncé likes peace and calm around her. She has zero time for drama and gossip. She likes her inner circle to be soft spoken if they have to talk at all. And you can expect the same will be true when she gives birth to the twins,” sources tell Straight Shuter. “You can only get into her private life if you are invited. She is very guarded and protects her privacy at all cost. She likes to be surrounded with peaceful colors and soft sounds. This will be of utmost importance for her when giving birth.”  This story is almost like opening up a fortune cookie or visiting your average storefront psychic. EVERYBODY knows Beyoncé is private. THAT doesn’t take an exclusive source to figure out.  Silent birth is a real thing though – something that Scientologists practice and Katie Holmes even did when she gave birth to Suri, but as much as Bey loves music we don’t really see her doing a silent birth.  Speaking of Bey’s love of music… Hit the flip for some recently posted pics of her from a Michael Jackson/Prince party.  GettyImages/Instagram",fake

This page contains spoilers from an upcoming, or newly released, installment of the Jurassic Park franchise. If you don't want spoilers, leave the page!          Lockwood's daughter was the daughter of Benjamin Lockwood, the partner of John Hammond in creation of Jurassic Park and company InGen.  She was raised by the housekeeper of Lockwood Manor, Iris Carroll.  She died untimely in a car crash along with her husband before the events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, causing Benjamin much distress. While Benjamin wanted to bring his daughter back through cloning, Hammond was opposed by the idea. This caused a break in the relationship between the two partners that was seemingly never rekindled. After the death of John Hammond, Lockwood went ahead and cloned his once daughter, resulting in Maisie Lockwood. Lockwood then kept Maisie's past secret to most visitors to the mansion by stating Maisie is his granddaughter, the daughter of his own daughter and her husband.

1519,"KATY Perry and Orlando Bloom are back together 11 months after they split, claim friends.  The A-list couple broke up in March 2017, but insiders say they’re officially dating again after a romantic holiday to the Maldives, reports The Sun.  “They’re back on,” a source reportedly told The Sun. “Katy wants to make things work this time around. She tried, but she couldn’t cut him off. She cares too much about him. This time, they’re keeping things low key — but they’re back together.”  Rumours that the pair had reunited started last month when both Bloom and Perry were spotted on holiday in the Maldives.  The singer flew in after her Dubai tour date, and Bloom posted that he was enjoying a break at the luxury Amilla Fushi resort.  Fans spotted the pair separately, then a friend’s tagged Instagram post revealed they were both at the same resort.  Since then, Perry and Bloom have been very public about their relationship — liking almost every one of each other’s Instagram posts and commenting on the photos.  When Bloom posted a video of himself driving, and crashing, an F1 car, Perry wrote “Exhibit A: why I’m scared of your driving” and also tagged him in a post about McDonalds.  She also commented on a photo of his dog Mighty and one of him modelling, telling the actor he looked so hot “you’re making yourself drool”.  Perry also posted an Instagram Story of her and her dog Butters hanging out at home — and Perry was wearing a special customised onsie with Bloom’s face on it, that she had made especially for Bloom’s 40th birthday last year.  Fans also spotted that the actor had been wearing a mustard Supreme hat on his Instagram Stories — which matches one that Perry wore on a trip to Japan with Bloom last year.  The two first got together after they were spotted partying together at a Golden Globes afterparty in 2016.  They issued a statement saying they were taking “respectful, loving space” from each other in March last year, and Orlando said he’d remain friends with Perry as they are “all grown up”.  Late last year they were spotted at an Ed Sheeran concert and paddleboarding on the beach in California, but sources say they’ve only officially started dating again this year.  The pop singer has a history of taking back her exes — she reportedly got back together with John Mayer five times before ending it in January 2016.

According to an insider, the singer is not expecting, and she is not even trying to enter motherhood at the moment.  A person, who attended a big event with the couple, explained: “She is not pregnant lol. She was taking shots backstage last night and drinking at the afterparty.”  Another source spoke to Hollywood Life and added: “At this point, Rihanna feels like all she can do is laugh off all the pregnancy rumors, in addition to just ignoring them now.

Yes, but definitely in the future, she is simply not ready to start a family… just yet. Rihanna loves children though, she is a natural mom, and she thinks Hassan will make an amazing father — he is really kind and patient, and a very loving person — but right now she is focused on her career first and foremost.

He and Kourtney didn’t get along. They decided to take a break, but were not officially over. Now with the pictures of Younes in Mexico, they are definitely not getting back together.”  “Kourtney doesn’t play games.

She also mentioned the Inclusion Rider, something people working in film can include in their contracts. The clause can be added to contracts for actors and others working on a movie, requiring that the movie’s producers hire a diverse cast and crew. If the movie wasn’t diverse, it would give the actor a legal reason to back out of the contract — meaning the rider could have a serious effect on all the hiring practices on a film.",real

16153,"Goop is kicking off its weekly podcast in a big way. Oprah big. Oprah Winfrey is Goop’s inaugural guest on its podcast, hosted by founder Gwyneth Paltrow, and the hour-plus conversation touches on everything Oprah, from her decades as an inimitable television host to her experiences with Harvey Weinstein and her ultimate hope for the #MeToo movement and her political aspirations, or lack thereof.  Winfrey said she was friendly with Weinstein in a professional capacity from the days of her eponymous talk show, but addressed accusations that she must have known of his allegedly long history of sexually predatory behavior toward female actors and other women, saying she simply had no idea and wasn’t really in that world of entertainment. But she did know that everyone dreaded getting a call from him.  “I was in Chicago, in my own little world, but what I knew about Harvey was that Harvey was a bully and that if Harvey’s on the phone, you didn’t want to take the call because you’re going to get bullied in some way,” Winfrey said.  While for her a call from Weinstein generally meant being pressured, in a way left undefined, to have certain people on her show, now Winfrey is left wondering why she even let herself be bullied at all.  Advertisement  “What I do question for myself is why I was willing to put up with a bullying thing?” Winfrey said. “I was willing to put up with, ‘OK I’ll take the call,’ ‘OK I’ll do that’…why am I willing to put up with an a–hole? Why we won’t tolerate other things, but you can throw phones and call people jerks or whatever and do all this nasty stuff.”  As for why Weinstein’s alleged behavior was a watershed for the long-normalized harassment and sexual abuse of women, despite many previous public allegations against not only Weinstein but other high-profile men, Winfrey thinks it’s something akin to critical mass.  “It had been coming, it had been coming,” Winfrey said. “It had been coming with [Bill] Cosby and nothing happened, it had been coming with Bill O’Reilly, even with the President of the United States, where people can hear the Access Hollywood tape and yet, nothing happens. It had been coming and [Weinstein] was the moment was where it all crystallized.…In order for a phenomenon to be a phenomenon everything has to line up. It means the culture, the zeitgeist, for a particular moment in time to be ready, available and open to hear that message.”  The idea that these issues and women’s experiences with abuse and harassment have been building up in the culture for so long, with most women throughout history being unable to speak up because it would likely have meant further harm to them and their families, was what Winfrey was trying to get across in her acceptance speech at this year’s Golden Globes — not a political platform.  Advertisement  “I wasn’t trying to run for any office,” Winfrey said of the speech. “I wanted to be able to say to the #MeToo movement, I’m proud of where we are and what we’re doing, but you need to know you didn’t get here alone. There are those who endured, suffered and didn’t speak because they couldn’t speak.”  Winfrey slipped back into her role of interviewer and asked Paltrow if her decision to go public last fall with her own Weinstein story — wherein the producer got her as a relatively unestablished young actor to his hotel room under the guise of a business meeting and proceeded to unabashedly proposition her and then berate her for confiding in family and friends about the episode — was triggered by the then few other stories that had come out about him.  “Very, and it’s been months of me trying to process through it all,” Paltrow, who worked with Weinstein several times after the incident, said. “It only happened one time and I confronted him and he never tried anything like that again, but he was [always] a bully about work things, he was shaming, he was really hard on me and then was incredibly generous and would send me a private plane somewhere. It was a kind of typical abusive relationship and I hadn’t processed it, because so much of my acting career and so many of the incredible highs and lows, as well, were associated with him and Miramax.”  Paltrow added that the experience of going public has “brought up a lot of stuff lately” including abuse from her childhood, a topic that Winfrey spoke of her own experiences with during the podcast, and said she’s recently begun to question whether her decision to mostly leave acting when she had her first child was actually related to her experiences with Weinstein.  Advertisement  “I always told myself the story that I’d lost the passion for it and then I had my daughter and I wanted to be home and now I’m starting to put the pieces together and thinking did this predominate relationship in my professional life lead me to not want to do it anymore?”  Winfrey said that so many negative experiences with Weinstein “certainly had an influence” but also admitted that her hope for the #MeToo movement goes beyond women’s rights, and that it continues to facilitate what she and Paltrow agreed has become “a culture of enough.”  “I’m hoping that it leads to a better way of all human beings treating each other and that this moment in the movement is leading to us toward saying, ‘Not only am I not going to take your sexual harassment, I’m not going to take any of your bulls–t.’ Period. I think we’re on our way but we’re still figuring it out.”",real
2789,"Last week, we reported on rumors that Rob Kardashian is dating Mehgan James, a reality star best known for her time on VH1's Bad Girls Club.  Several media outlets seemed certain that the relationship was the real deal and that Rob and Meghan had been seeing each other on the down-low for months.  As more details rolled in, however, the situation became increasingly sketchy.  Eventually, Rob himself took to social media to deny that he's dating Mehgan, insisting that he's never even met the troubled 27-year-old.  ""Wait reading online about some chick I'm dating Megan something,"" Rob tweeted.  ""Not true never even met or heard of her before.""  The dual takeaways from this tweet seem abundantly clear:  1. Someone needs to introduce Rob to our old friend Mr. Punctuation, and 2. he's legitimately not hooking up with Meghan.  After all, Rob isn't one to deny that he's sleeping with a hot, young, semi-famous woman unless there's really just no shred of truth to the rumor.  So how did news of this phony couple spread so far so fast?  Well, it seems Mehgan may have had a hand creating the false impression that she and Rob are an item.  At first, James pretended she was just as shocked by the situation as everyone else.  But a new report from TMZ accuses her of spreading the rumor herself in an effort to boost her public profile.  Sources close to the situation say that James and her team reported the fake relationship to a number of tabloids and media outlets, so as to help the aspiring model accumulate a larger online following.  The sad thing is, the ploy seems to have been effective.  Mehgan's Instagram following has doubled - reaching a total of more than 800,000 - in the week since news of her alleged relationship with Rob first broke.  Judging by the comments on some of her pics, however, she's already experiencing some backlash from her ill-conceived publicity stunt.  Sources say Rob's baby mama, Blac Chyna, is especially disgusted by the situation, and we don't blame her.  After all, if you're gonna use Rob for fame, the least you could do is go an actual date with the guy!  That's just common decency.",fake

371,"It seems Sandra Bullock won’t be walking down the aisle anytime soon. According to a new report, even though the A-list actress and her boyfriend, Bryan Randall, are doing perfectly, they aren’t in a rush to get engaged.  “Sandy is a bit hesitant about getting married because of the legalities,” a pal of hers told Us Weekly, adding that Bryan has not yet adopted her two kids, Louis, 7, and Laila, 5. “It gets complicated.”  Apparently, Sandra turned to her good friend Jennifer Aniston for advice, who is clearly a pro at secretive relationships and weddings. The Blind Side actress suggested she and Bryan would hold a private, small ceremony to which Jen agreed since she thinks they’re basically already husband and wife. “Jen was saying, ‘What’s the difference? He’s already living here, he’s already your old man,'” a source told the news outlet.  Prior to Bryan, Sandra was married to Jesse James from 2005 until their messy divorce in 2010 after he admitted to a plethora of cheating scandals. “She went through a great deal of heartbreak after Jesse,” says the friend. “And she is scarred by it to this day.”  It was previously revealed that despite her past heartbreak, she’s found love again with Bryan. A source said, “Bryan takes care of her in all of the right ways. She feels loved and appreciated all of the time.” Can we find a relationship like that, please?  Sandra, 53, and Bryan, 51, began dating in late 2015, and even though the happy couple is often busy with their careers and “most of their time revolves around the kids,” they’ve both made it a point to make time for each other whether it’s by planning a late lunch or even an early dinner.  “Bryan has fully stepped up and embraced the dad role,” the insider adds. “He is 100 percent there for Louis and Laila and wonderful with them in every way. Sandy feels incredibly fortunate and blessed that she is sharing the parenting journey with Bryan.” Here’s hoping they tie the knot sooner rather than later!",fake

465,"Reverend Swadley – the local wedding priest and friend of the Pitt family – has confirmed to friends that the A-list couple recently spent a week with Brad’s family, discussing detailed plans for a wedding.  It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar. He knows he wants Jen to be his wife again.  ‘We’re pretty sure they’ll be married in Missouri before the end of the year, Brad and Jen are both keen to push through their divorces as soon as possible so they can walk down the aisle together. That’s all that they want.’  For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!",fake

In between handshakes at Dublin’s Croke Park July 11, Duchess Meghan allowed 3-year-old Walter Cullen to pet her cheek while husband Prince Harry let Dylan Mahon, 4, touch his beard. The duo, says a source in the new issue of Us Weekly, “enjoy every opportunity to interact and spend time with locals.” And though their stay was short — just two days — it ignited their desire to travel.  Before Harry, 33, and the former Suits star, 36, begin packing for their October tour of Australia and New Zealand, they are already laying the groundwork for another trip in the spring of 2019 — this time, to her native country. “They are so excited to head to the U.S.,” reveals a palace insider, noting it will be their first trip to the States since their May vows. “Meghan is looking forward to introducing Harry to everything she loves about the U.S.”  Her favorites range from coast to coast. Though there is no official itinerary yet, “they are thinking New York, Washington, D.C., and California,” says the insider. “They’re working to finalize locations and venues.” Their goal, however, is set. “Meghan and Harry want to solidify ties between the U.K. and the U.S.,” continues the source. “They want to highlight and foster these relationships.”  They’re open to possibilities, too. Other potential stops include visits to Chicago’s Obama Foundation — “President and Mrs. Obama have been stalwart supporters,” says the insider — as well as Canada. Adds the insider, “The Canadian Foreign Office has heard about the tour and would love to have them stop there. This may very well become a North American tour.”  For more on Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry’s trip across the pond, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now.

1197,"Advertisement  The Duke of York 'footed the bill' for Harper Beckham's party which took place at his own private residence in the palace, it has been claimed.  And it is not the first time such a party has taken place, despite criticism that Prince Andrew and his former wife Sarah Ferguson were 'treating Buckingham Palace like a theme park'.  A royal source told MailOnline all members of the Royal Family have private quarters in the palace and that guests 'come and go all the time' for private events they fund themselves.  David and Victoria's youngest child enjoyed a day at the Queen's residence last week alongside Princess Eugenie and a large group of school friends, with her parents uploading the photos to Instagram on Monday, her sixth birthday.  A representative for the Beckham family yesterday claimed it was Fergie - a long-time friend of their family - who extended the invitation, telling MailOnline: 'Let me be very clear this was a private tea party last week that the Duchess of York organised.'  However, the Duchess' official spokesman has distanced her from the sole responsibility of organisation, suggesting Andrew and the whole family were behind the controversial function and that her ex-husband was 'footing the bill', which led to outrage from the Queen's former press secretary, among others.  Scroll down for video  That's some party venue: Harper Beckham holds her balloon at Buckingham Palace. her parents shared the snaps on Instagram on Monday as they wished her a happy sixth birthday, but denied the visit was for the milestone  Friends in high places: Once inside, she posed with her friends and Princess Eugenie in a small drawing room inside the palace at the event, which was organised by the Duchess of York  Something to say: David later shared another post in which he defended the special party, saying 'this wasn't the palace opening the gates for Harper's birthday party'  Proud: David shared another snap of himself cuddling his daughter, who was wearing a cream lace dress after seemingly getting changed  The Duchess of York (bottom left) is a longstanding friend of the Beckhams and is seen with Victoria (far right) and other Spirce Girls Mel C and Mel B back in 1999  Among other Instagram tributes from the family, her brother Cruz wrote: 'Dear Harper I can't believe it has been already 6 years yoyo are such a big girl so to the best sister in the world I love you so much have a amazing day'  She's so loved: Her eldest brother Brooklyn shared this picture, posting: 'Happy birthday to my little sister. Love you so much'  Her spokesman said: 'The Duke of York and the York family hosted a private event at the private apartments of the Duke at Buckingham Palace which was privately catered.'  He said it was not the Duchess' doing but was a 'private family event' which he said was a 'small family tea'.  The unprecedented step has divided opinion over the Beckham's seemingly preferential treatment and Dickie Arbiter, the Queen's former press secretary, was highly critical of the party.  He told the Times: 'What a nonsense. What are they doing there? What is Eugenie having a party there for? What is Sarah York doing, having organised it — allegedly? None of them has got a right to be there. Is it being opened up as a theme park? It devalues what the place is all about.  'Why can't Joe Public, when they go in on the Buckingham Palace tour, why can't there have their pictures taken in the quadrangle?  'That sets a precedent. They don't allow cameras in the summer opening and people can't just walk out in the quadrangle and pose for photographs. So why do the Beckhams get special treatment?'  The 'indiscreet' publication of the pictures – showing the youngster enjoying the run of the royal residence – caused frustration at the Palace. One image was taken by the former footballer inside Andrew's private office with Princess Eugenie, it is understood.  A royal source added: 'Any costs in terms of refreshments were covered [by Andrew] privately.'  It is understood that both Andrew and his former wife, the Duchess of York, were at the party.  Sources close to the Duchess of York insisted it was a 'family' event, with the invitation being extended by the whole of the York family.  'Members of the Royal Family often invite friends for tea at the palace and the Beckhams are family friends. This was a treat for Harper and some of her friends,' the source said.  However, they admitted that the Beckhams' decision to publish photos had not gone down well.  'It was very indiscreet for them to have posted pictures on a public forum of what was a private family event,' they said.  Sweet: Harper's mother, Victoria, also shared a Snapchat which showed the enormous pile of presents her daughter received (left)  Something to say: Some comments were not quite as favourable  Gorgeous: While Romeo shared another sweet snap, writing: 'Happy birthday to the best sister in the world!!!!!! I hope you have an amazing day. I love you so much'  Eugenie, 27, who is eighth in line to the throne, can be seen kneeling down with her arms around two of Harper's five friends.  Underneath the picture, David wrote: 'Lucky Harper meeting a real life princess at the Palace x.'  Harper also dressed like royalty for the occasion – in a blue gown like her heroine Princess Elsa from the hit Disney film Frozen.  Details of the supposedly 'private' tea party were shrouded in secrecy until yesterday morning, when both David and Victoria Beckham decided to treat their combined 55million followers on Instagram to a series of photographs to mark Harper's birthday.  Another photograph shows Harper on her own, holding a red balloon in the Palace's central quadrangle, with the message from mother Victoria: 'Our little birthday princess x Kisses.'  As the pictures went viral – being viewed several million times within hours – both the Beckhams and Buckingham Palace came under fire online. One critic wrote: 'If you have enough money you can buy anything!!'  Another said: 'Is this a new commercial venture by the Royal Family or do all little princesses now get an invite?'  Sweet: The boys all helped to put a doll's house together for their youngest sibling  Well wishers: Lots of fans wrote kind messages alongside the latest posts  'Happy birthday baby girl': Victoria, 43, had taken to Instagram to document the celebrations that took place ahead of her daughter Harper's sixth birthday on Monday  Royal author Robert Jobson last night warned that Buckingham Palace should not be seen as a 'party venue for millionaires', particularly when the Queen is about to receive £370million of public money for a top-to-toe refit.  He said: 'It seems odd to me that if you have the money or connections then the Palace – a building funded by the British taxpayer – can be used in this way for a selected few. If it is just for the rich and famous it is simply not right.  'The Palace is the venue for glittering state occasions but when it is used – or misused like this – surely the public is entitled to know how it came about, who organised it, was money paid and why it is only open to rich and famous ex-footballers.'  The sports star yesterday posted a further picture of himself and Harper at the Palace, this time with his mother Sandra.  Family day: The fashion designer shared a group shot of herself, David and their loved ones as they got together to mark Harper's special day  'Posh Spice or Dawn French?': Victoria revealed she and her footballer beau had been trying out their cake decorating skills, but appeared to mock David's efforts with her fans  He wrote: 'One last picture of the birthday girl ... Just to be clear this wasn't the Palace opening the gates for Harper's birthday party, this was a tea party where us and other guests were invited, so it was a beautiful thing to do with my mum, Harper plus a few school friends... We were honored [sic] to be able to [be] there...'  Asked to explain why the tea party was held, a Buckingham Palace spokesman confirmed the 'private' event.  He said: 'From time to time members of the Royal Family who reside at royal residences invite guests to visit privately.'  'Mums had a little too many Pimms!': David, meanwhile, suggested everybody had been in high spirits at the bash as he poked fun at his mother Sandra  Loving life: It's not the first time the Beckhams have been at the palace. Victoria received an OBE for her contribution to fashion from the Duke of Cambridge back in April  Proud moment: Victoria's husband-of-17-years David received his OBE at Buckingham Palace in 2003 for services to football, with Victoria by his side  Lovely: Sources close to the family told MailOnline before Christmas that Victoria, 42, was 'delighted and humbled for the recognition' when she picked up her gong  Close: Meanwhile, in an interview with Esquire magazine back in 2012, David said that he now counts Princes William and Harry as friends - pictured in 2010  VIP invite: David and Victoria arriving at Westminster Abbey for the wedding of Prince William to Kate Middleton, in London, UK on April 29, 2011  Ode: The famous family also nicknamed their former £10million Hertfordshire residence 'Beckingham palace,' before putting it up for sale in 2013  The Duchess of York is no stranger to controversy, after she was secretly filmed offering to sell access of Prince Andrew for £500,000  The Duchess of York is no stranger to controversy, after she was secretly filmed offering to sell access to Prince Andrew for £500,000.  A News of the World video in 2010 showed Sarah Ferguson promising to introduce an undercover reporter posing as a wealthy businessman to the Prince, who has been the UK's special representative for international trade and investment since 2001.  During a covert film of the agreement, the Duchess was apparently handed a $40,000 US (£27,000) cash down payment.  She was filmed telling him how to transfer £500,000 to her UK bank account and said: 'Then that, is then like, then you open up all the channels whatever you need, whatever you want, and then that's what and then you meet Andrew and that's fine. And that's, that's when you really open up whatever you want.'  The paper said that, despite the Prince knowing nothing about the deal, the Duchess claimed to have discussed it with him: 'Andrew said to me, 'Tell him £500,000'.  'He knows that he's had to underwrite me up to now because I've got no money. So if you want to meet him in your business, look after me and he'll look after you ... you'll get it back tenfold.'  The Duchess later said she was 'devastated' and 'regretful' about the incident.",fake
18409,"After eight long years of feuding, the cast of Jersey Shorehas finally buried the hatchet with Angelina Pivarnick, the infamous cast member who left the show multiple times during the show's first and second seasons.  On Thursday's new episode of Jersey Shore Family Vacation, Angelina walked back into the lives of her former roomates, looking to make amends.  Angelina notoriously walked off the show midway through the first season before calling it quits for good the next season after getting into a full-on fight with Nicole ""Snooki"" Polizzi, and generally feuding with everyone else.  However, being off TV for the better part of a decade has a way of making people want to get back on TV -- or rather, it made Angelina come back looking to extend an olive branch instead of her fist.  Things started off on shaky ground at first when Jenni ""JWoww"" Farley and Snooki returned to the house to find Angelina waiting for them.  JWoww initially rejected the idea entirely and stormed out, while Snooki called out her former castmate for a litany of insults and offenses. However, Angelina surprised her by candidly apologizing for remarks she'd made in the past, including mocking Snooki's lip injections.

Her persistence paid off, and with Ronnie Ortiz-Magro championing her to Snooki, and convincing her to let Angelina party with them.  The two former enemies managed to quickly move past their drama and began enjoying each other's company, i.e. getting totally wasted and coming home drunk, hanging off one another like life-long pals.  JWoww was understandably furious when she came home to find them acting like besties, but eventually, she came around herself and accepted Angelina into her good graces.  Addressing the house, Angelina admitted that she had said 'f**ked up s**t"" in the past.  ""I was spiteful, I was immature and I shouldn’t have went that way,"" she said.

The 37-year-old actor began his five-hour-long Twitter spree by announcing that he would not be watching the 2018 Oscars.  ""I will be live tweeting the Oscars tonight, but I won't be watching them.

10821,"    Did Nikki Bella retire? Fans have been following Nikki’s journey on her hit E! TV shows Total Divas and Total Bellas after she underwent surgery for her nearly career-ending neck injury last January, and it was a long road to recovery. She had a brief comeback in 2016, but she had her last match at Wrestlemania 33 earlier this year — after which her longtime love John Cena got down on one knee and proposed! Both Nikki and her twin sister Brie Bella — also known as the Bella Twins — are currently in retirement, and they exclusively revealed to Life & Style that watching the WWE women’s matches from the sidelines has given them serious FOMO. Watch the video below to find out what the Bella Twins miss the most about wrestling after retiring from the WWE!  Like Nikki, Brie is also retired from the WWE and she retired just one year before Nikki did after a career-defining match during Wrestlemania 32. Brie was open about the reason for her retirement, which was so that she could focus her energy on trying to start a family with her husband, Daniel Bryan. After struggling to concieve, she finally got pregnant with their daughter Birdie Joe, who was born in May.  But now that Brie has become a mommy, it looks like she’s ready to get back in the ring with her sister — and it may be sooner than everyone thinks. The Bella Twins opened up about their plans to return to the ring at some point next year.  “We miss it terribly,” Brie told In Touch back in September. “I think about it every day. Once you have the passion for wrestling, you can’t forget it,” Nikki added. “I say we make our comeback in 2018, but as the Bella Twins, not individuals,” Brie told Nikki and Nikki agreed: “It’s a deal!”",real
2940,"Lindsay Lohan was spotted at a modest fashion show wearing a hijab. The actress attended the second annual London Modest Fashion Week over the weekend, and she dressed the part.  Before the show, she posted a video on her Instagram, in which she learned how to style a hijab and expressed her desire to wear it traditionally. “I think it needs [to be] a little bit more tighter in the [back]. I don’t want it to come off and show too much,” the once risqué woman told her hijab-tutor in the video.  Photo: BBC News  When someone suggested she switch wrapping styles so she could wear it as tight as she wanted, she said she wanted “to do traditional Saudi wrap. … That’s what I’d rather learn to do so I know. … I want to learn how to do it properly.” This could be because she’s set to film an all-female movie in Saudi Arabia. She then told the woman that she had been living in Dubai for three years.  She also posted a video from the fashion show and spoke to BBC Minute about modest apparel. “Fashion doesn’t always have to be so naked and can be adventurous and still beautiful, with a strong group of women behind it,” Lohan said.  Not only did she wear the right clothing, she also wore the right makeup. According to halal/vegetarian/vegan makeup retailer HawaCosmetics, Lohan stopped by their booth and told them about “how she’s into halal cosmetics and what she’s actually wearing on her face today was all halal!!” according to their social media post. They were referencing the Muslim diet and referring to avoiding non-halal makeup.      Story continues  Lohan’s efforts to respect Muslim traditions are getting mixed reactions. Some people really into this look were impressed by her interest, including the designers.  @lindsaylohan is getting fitted for a hijab on her insta live right now and I am LIVING #Traditional — Evan ☕️BlackWhite (@EvBenjamin) February 17, 2018      Can we deep, a whole fabulous @lindsaylohan repping at London Modest Fashion week @HauteElan!

Lindsay Lohan seems seriously confused, vis a vis the intersection of Islam and BDSM-lite with the hijab and ill-fitting leather minidress. — Amy Alkon (@amyalkon) February 18, 2018      Lindsay Lohan, who has never openly admitted to converting to #Islam, was spotted at the event wearing a hijab  Lindsay Lohan Rocks Leather Dress at #ZeynepKartal Fashion Show (AW18 collection show) @lindsaylohan @pekkan1 @ZeynepKartalOffical pic.twitter.com/kGdKvxfv1D — Real News Line (@RealNewsLine) February 18, 2018      Modest fashion blogger Maryam thinks we’re overthinking it. “Lindsay Lohan donning a Hijab is nothing offensive or alerting in my opinion,” she told Yahoo! Lifestyle. She gives the actress credit for exploring another religion. “I think it’s actually pretty cool that she is touching this part of the Islamic faith. If she wants to wear it, even if it’s occasionally, that’s her personal choice, I don’t see what the issue is,” the Muslim mom stated. “She’s expressed her interest in Islam and perhaps wants to experience the Hijab aspect of it and that’s kind of a no-brainer. So many Muslim women and those studying Islam take this step in their spiritual journey as Hijab is a pivotal part of a Muslim women’s identity. It’s just unfortunate her journey has to be so scrutinized and watched by the thousands since she’s a public figure.”  While LiLo does love to shock, anyone who’s been following her shouldn’t be that surprised. She expressed an interest in Islam before this. She changed her Instagram bio in January to “Salam Aleikum,” a standard greeting among Muslims. “In Islamic culture, I feel like it’s a family to me, a lot of my friends are Arab, and they’ve been really good people to me,” she said in an interview on Good Morning Britain in 2017.  Lohan also told Piers Morgan about the time she got stopped at an airport while wearing a headscarf. She referred to it as the first time she was “racially profiled.” She had to remove her headscarf, and while she was OK with that, she was still shaken. “What scared me was, in that moment, how would another woman who doesn’t feel comfortable taking off her headscarf feel? That was really interesting to me. I mean, I was kind of in shock,” she said.  When pressed about her interest in the religion, she said she had a soft spot for Islam. “I do study it, nothing is confirmed yet…” she said of converting.  The actress went to Turkey in 2016 to visit with Syrian refugees and was spotted wearing a floral headscarf. Then there was the time she hit the beach in Thailand wearing a burkini.  And she sparked rumors that she’d be designing her own hijabs in 2017 when she posted a black-and-white photo of herself wearing one, with a caption reading, “New Fashion Line coming soon …. #fashion.” The post has since vanished, as have any signs of her hijab fashion line.

8539,"While it may be true that most swimsuit shopping happens in June when we’re all still enthusiastically making beach plans, we may or may not keep and aren’t totally put off by the prospect of a heat wave, there’s something to be said for waiting until August to stock up on swimwear.  End-of-season sales are still on, discounts are deep, and those bathing suits that a few months ago seemed awfully expensive for just a few skimpy bits of nylon are now actually quite reasonably priced—and at certain retailers, downright cheap.  Because the selection has been picked over, you’ve got to be strategic: use the site’s filters to narrow down what you see to only the suits available in your size, otherwise you’re setting yourself up for disappointment—especially if you happen to wear something other than an XS or XL. Stores with copious swimwear offerings each season—think ASOS, J.Crew, and any major department store—are going to have both the deepest discounts and the greatest chance of finding something that fits you within your desired price range.  Also, don’t be put off if only the top or bottom of a suit is available in your size—think of it as an opportunity to mix and match (some of my favorite bikinis were never actually meant to be pairs). And if you’ve been coveting a piece from an It-brand like Lisa Marie Fernandez, Solid and Striped, or Marysia but can’t imagine shelling out more than $300 for a swimsuit, now’s the time to do a little hunting—you may get lucky and find one for 70 percent off.  Ahead, find 31 bathing suit bargains to snag before summer’s up.",real
4885,"Mel B’s sister, Danielle Brown has decided to speak against the alleged abuse Stephen Belafonte has put his wife through after Mel got a restraining order against the man. Danielle started and entire social media war against the abuser and slammed him with her sharp words.  At first, Danielle posted on Instagram a snap meant for the media in which she assured them she never has and never will sell a story on her sister.  In order to be left alone, however, she did address the situation, later on, slamming Belafonte in another tweet: ” @stephenthinks11 8 years of abusive calls me and my mum have had stating we would never see Melanie again.I am laughing and celebrating as you were wrong. you are a sorry excuse of a man !!”  “To the left to the left everything you own in the box to the left hope you … go to jail and rot in hell!!” she added.  Her series of tweets came shortly after Belafonte also decided to open up about the situation and tell his side of the story.  Stephen denied all of Mel B’s allegations, including the ones about him beating her up and forcing her into threesomes, claiming that it is all “a smear campaign” against him.  Belafonte’s rep claimed that after legal action will be taking by the man it will be proven that Mel B lied in order to cover up her own marital misconducts. Furthermore, she tried to gain leverage with the kids’ custody by lying.  They also alleged that when the truth about the extent to which Mel B lied in the depiction of her marriage will be revealed real victims of domestic violence will be very offended by her outrageous accusations.

248,"Post Malone recently lamented, in a revealing Rolling Stone profile, that his friend Justin Bieber has turned “super-religious” and “real culty,” claiming the pop star had donated $10 million to Hillsong, the megachurch he belongs to. “It’s nice to support something you believe in, I guess,” the rapper said. “But people are spending so much money, and God doesn’t care that your church has a fucking gold roof.” Now Carl Lentz, pastor at Hillsong New York City, has refuted those claims, telling RS, “I put no stock in comments made by people who know absolutely nothing about the subject they are speaking on.”  “I do not know Post Malone, and I have no idea why he would say reckless things about our church, which he has never visited,” he continued. “Justin has not given our church $10 million, and we do not have gold ceilings. We do not even own a church building. So that gives you a little insight about how serious you can take his observations about anything to do with us.”  Despite the tension, Lentz added that he’s still a Post Malone fan. “He is a very gifted artist,” he said, “and I wish him nothing but the best.”  In Rolling Stone‘s original, wide-ranging story, a source close to Bieber also denied that he’s donated $10 million. During the same conversation, Post Malone labeled the mega-church “a total cult” while praising the Purpose singer as a “fucking awesome, great dude” and “genuine friend.”",fake

19872,"E! Online sat down with the cast of Deadpool 2 at Comic-Con this past weekend. The interview, similar to the film, was filled with dirty and fun jokes. When the interviewer asked Reynolds about the infamous red and black costume, he said that he doesn’t have to deal with the chaffing of wearing such a tight costume anymore.  “Oh I got that down for the second movie,” Reynolds explained. He then continued saying, “It’s a very specific system. It’s a homemade recipe my mom came up with. She lives in Vancouver so she can come over and get it on me before we shoot.”  Reynolds’ mom was actually in the audience during the interview, playing along with the joke.  Reynolds then said, “She did the whole cast before we got her,” continuing to play along to the chaffing joke.  The interviewer then asked Reynolds if he’s allowed to cuss in front of his mother, being that Deadpool is filled with cusses. He joked saying that they usually “beep it out,” but then went onto say “Yeah, she’s heard it all, I’m the youngest of four boys.”  Ryan Reynolds and Mom Featured image credit: Arthur Mola Getty Images  The cast were at Comic-Con to promote the release of Deadpool 2: Super Duper Cut which is an extended version of the theatrical release. It features alternate jokes as well as extended and deleted scenes. Reynolds said that they shot so many alternate versions of every joke that they could basically release a different film.  According to the Washington Post, the cast teased a little bit of Deadpool 2: Super Duper Cut at a panel and fans were all for it.  Reynolds Instagrammed his appreciation of attending the event and being Deadpool. He posted a photo of himself at the panel with the caption, “Being the drunk uncle of the Marvel universe is a responsibility I take seriously. Loved bringing the #Deadpool2Super Duper F’n Cut to #SDCC — out on Digital August 7 & Blu-ray August 21”  Reynolds is also slated to voice the title character in Detective Pikachu out next year.

Last month, to promote his clothing line, Bad Vibes Forever, his mother appeared in an Instagram video to say “his message was essentially to heal” and that he was “spreading love and light to the world.” A week later, a news release for a major-label single called him the “voice of his generation.”  “He’s going to go down as a Tupac,” Sebastian Baldeon, a producer, D.J. and songwriter known as Diablo, who worked with XXXTentacion when they were both starting out in South Florida, said in an interview. “The music he was putting out was so good, and so beautiful, and the fact that he was taken from society and his family and his friends left such a big impact on people.”  XXXTentacion, born Jahseh Onfroy, had built a huge audience before he was fatally shot during an attempted robbery in Deerfield Beach, Fla., in June. His first two official albums generated nearly 5.5 billion streams, according to Nielsen Music, and he had more than eight million Instagram followers hanging on to every word of his posts and stories, which like his music, were emotional missives that addressed depression and anger.

Earlier that same day a doctor had told the spouses of three years that their baby boy was still two weeks away from arriving.

415,"Less than two months after Kim Kardashian welcomed her daughter Chicago, she already has baby No. 4 on her mind — but that’s where she would draw the line.  “I don’t think I could handle more than that,” the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 37, said in her cover story for Elle magazine’s April 2018 issue. “My time is spread really thin. And I think it’s important that in all couples, the mom gives the husband as much attention as the kids.”  As Kardashian and Kanye West’s family blossoms (they are also the parents of daughter North, 4, and son Saint, 2), so does their relationship. “He’s taught me to have more of an opinion,” she explained. “I’ve taught him to be a bit more calm or cautious. We’re a good balance.”  As Us Weekly exclusively revealed in July 2017, the couple hired a surrogate to carry Chicago because the reality star suffered from placenta accreta during her previous pregnancies.  “It’s a really tricky thing,” she recalled of the process. “What sex do you put in? I just said, ‘Which one is the healthiest? Pick the healthiest one,’ and that was a girl.”  But Kardashian wasn’t a momzilla with her gestational carrier. “I straight-up told her, ‘Look, I ate doughnuts every single day. If you want doughnuts and ice cream, go for it. Do whatever you feel. I’m not going to be picky like that. That’s just ridiculous,’” she told the publication.  In the end, the social media mogul knew she made the right decision. “I hated being pregnant,” she said. “But as much as I hated it, I still wished I could have done it on my own. The control is hard at the beginning. Once you let that go, it’s the best experience. I would recommend surrogacy for anybody.”",fake

Sources reveal Aniston, 48, is pleading with Theroux, 46, to completely cut ties with buddies of the likes of Danny Masterson and Terry Richardson — whom Jen has already banned from her social circle amid the climate of harassment.  “Jen is really freaked out by all of the harassment stories around Hollywood and it’s led to a reality check when it comes to Justin and his oddball buddies like Terry Richardson, Danny Masterson, and even Louis CK,” a source spills to Radar.  As readers know, all three men have been accused of sexual harassment in recent months.  “These are all guys Justin seriously respected, but Jen’s demanding he have no association with them going forward.”  “Justin likes to play up his edgy ‘street cred’ and his cool New York friends,” the insider says, adding, “but this is way more controversial than Jen would like, especially when she’s dealing with her big corporate sponsors like Smart Water or production partners like Apple.”  But Theroux’s bad boy buds are the least of the couple’s problems.  As Radar previously reported exclusively, the duo’s two-year marriage was on the brink and erupted in a face-to-face showdown over the holidays after they had spent two and a half months apart. Sources claimed the incident sent the two hurtling toward a $225 million divorce.  The vicious bust-up at their Bel-Air mansion on Dec. 14 was “the fight to end all fights,” according to insiders — who saw a furious Justin storm out and head to a luxury hotel. “It was a stupid argument — the kind of disagreement most couples have.

10897,"Not to be confused with MeTwo movement  #MeToo does not redirect here due to technical restrictions  movement against sexual harassment and assault  The Me Too (or #MeToo) movement, with variations of related local or international names, is a movement against sexual harassment and sexual abuse where people publicize their allegations of sex crimes committed by powerful and/or prominent men.[1][2][3] The phrase ""Me Too"" was initially used in this context on social media in 2006, on Myspace, by sexual harassment survivor and activist Tarana Burke.[4]  Similar to other social justice and empowerment movements based upon breaking silence, the purpose of ""Me Too"", as initially voiced by Burke as well as those who later adopted the tactic, is to empower women through empathy and solidarity through strength in numbers, especially young and vulnerable women, by visibly demonstrating how many women have survived sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace.[4][5][6]  Following the exposure of the widespread sexual-abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein in early October 2017,[7][8] the movement began to spread virally as a hashtag on social media.[6][9][10] On October 15, 2017, American actress Alyssa Milano posted on Twitter, ""If all the women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote 'Me too' as a status, we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem,"" saying that she got the idea from a friend.[11][12][13][14] A number of high-profile posts and responses from American celebrities Gwyneth Paltrow,[15] Ashley Judd,[16] Jennifer Lawrence,[17] and Uma Thurman, among others, soon followed.[18]  Widespread media coverage and discussion of sexual harassment, particularly in Hollywood, led to high-profile firings, as well as criticism and backlash.[19][20][21]  After millions of people started using the phrase and hashtag in this manner in English, the expression began to spread to dozens of other languages. The scope has become somewhat broader with this expansion, however, and Burke has more recently referred to it as an international movement for justice for marginalized people in marginalized communities.[22]  Purpose  The original purpose of ""Me Too"" as used by Tarana Burke in 2006 was to empower women through empathy, especially young and vulnerable women. In October 2017, Alyssa Milano encouraged using the phrase as a hashtag to help reveal the extent of problems with sexual harassment and assault by showing how many people have experienced these events themselves.[4][5]  After millions of people started using the phrase, and it spread to dozens of other languages, the purpose changed and expanded, and as a result, it has come to mean different things to different people. Tarana Burke accepts the title of ""leader"" of the movement, but has stated that she considers herself more of a ""worker."" Burke has stated that this movement has grown to include both men and women of all colors and ages, as it continues to support marginalized people in marginalized communities.[19][22] There have also been movements by men aimed at changing the culture through personal reflection and future action, including #IDidThat, #IHave, and #IWill.[23]  Awareness and empathy  Analyses of the movement often point to the prevalence of sexual violence, which has been estimated by the World Health Organization to affect one-third of all women worldwide. A 2017 poll by ABC News and The Washington Post also found that 54% of American women report receiving ""unwanted and inappropriate"" sexual advances with 95% saying that such behavior usually goes unpunished. Others state that #MeToo underscores the need for men to intervene when they witness demeaning behavior.[24][25][26]  Burke said that #MeToo declares sexual violence sufferers are not alone and should not be ashamed.[27] Burke says sexual violence is usually caused by someone the woman knows, so people should be educated from a young age that they have the right to say no to sexual contact from any person, even after repeated solicitations from an authority or spouse, and to report predatory behavior.[28] Burke advises men to talk to each other about consent, call out demeaning behavior when they see it and try to listen to victims when they tell their stories.[28]  Alyssa Milano described the reach of #MeToo as helping society understand the ""magnitude of the problem"" and said, ""it's a standing in solidarity to all those who have been hurt.""[29][30] She stated that the success of #MeToo will require men to take a stand against behavior that objectifies women.[31]  Policies and laws  Burke has stated the current purpose of the movement is to give people the resources to have access to healing, and to advocate for changes to laws and policies. Burke has highlighted goals such as processing all untested rape kits, re-examining local school policies, improving the vetting of teachers, and updating sexual harassment policies.[32] She has called for all professionals who work with children to be fingerprinted and subjected to a background check before being cleared to start work. She advocates for sex education that teaches kids to report predatory behavior immediately.[28] Burke supports the #MeToo bill in the US Congress, which would remove the requirement that staffers of the federal government go through months of ""cooling off"" before being allowed to file a complaint against a Congressperson.[32]  Milano states that a priority for #MeToo is changing the laws surrounding sexual harassment and assault, for example instituting protocols that give sufferers in all industries the ability to file complaints without retaliation. She supports legislation making it difficult for publicly traded companies to hide cover-up payments from their stockholders and would like to make it illegal for employers to require new workers to sign non-disclosure agreements as a condition of employment.[31] Gender analysts such as Anna North have stated that #MeToo should be addressed as a labor issue due to the economic disadvantages to reporting harassment. North suggested combating underlying power imbalances in some workplaces, for example by raising the tipped minimum wage, and embraces innovations like the ""portable panic buttons"" that are mandated for hotel employees in Seattle.[33]  Others have suggested that barriers to employment must be removed, such as the job requirement by some employers to sign non-disclosure agreements or other agreements that prevent an employee from talking about their employment publicly, or taking disputes (including sexual harassment claims) to arbitration rather than to legal proceedings. It's been suggested that legislation should be passed that bans these types of mandatory pre-employment agreements.[1]  Some policy-based changes that have been suggested include increasing managerial oversight; creating clear internal reporting mechanisms; more effective and proactive disciplinary measures; creating a culture that encourages employees to be open about serious problems;[1] imposing financial penalties for companies that allow workers to remain in their position when they have repeatedly sexually harassed others; and forcing companies to pay huge fines or lose tax breaks if they decide to retain workers who are sexual harassers.[34]  Media coverage  In the coverage of #MeToo, there has been widespread discussion about the best ways to stop sexual harassment and abuse - for those who are currently being victimized at work, as well as those who are seeking justice for past abuse and trying to find ways to end what they see as a widespread culture of abuse. There is general agreement that a lack of effective reporting options is a major factor that drives unchecked sexual misconduct in the workplace.[35]  False reports of sexual assault are very rare, but when they happen, they are put in the spotlight for the public to see. This can give the false impression that the majority of the reported sexual assaults are false. However, false reports of sexual assault only make up 2%–10% of the total number that are reported.[36][37] These figures do not take into account that the majority of victims do not report when they are assaulted or harassed. Misconceptions about false reports are one of the reasons why women are scared to report their experiences with sexual assault - because they are afraid that no one will believe them, that in the process they will have embarrassed and humiliated themselves, in addition to opening themselves up to retribution from the assailants.[38][39]  In France, a person who makes a sexual harassment complaint at work is reprimanded or fired 40% of the time, while the accused person is typically not investigated or punished.[40] In the United States, a 2016 report from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission states that although 25–85% of women say they experience sexual harassment at work, few ever report the incidents, most commonly due to fear of reprisal.[35] There is evidence that in Japan, as few as 4% of rape victims report the crime, and the charges are dropped about half the time.[41][42]  There is a discussion on the best ways to handle whisper networks, or private lists of ""people to avoid"" that are shared unofficially in nearly every major institution or industry where sexual harassment is common due to power imbalances, including government, media, news, and academia. These lists have the stated purpose of warning other workers in the industry and are shared from person-to-person, on forums, in private social media groups, and via spreadsheets. However, it has been argued that these lists can become ""weaponized"" and be used to spread unsubstantiated gossip - an opinion which has been discussed widely in the media.[43]  Defenders say the lists provide a way to warn other vulnerable people in the industry if worried about serious retribution from the abusers, especially if complaints have already been ignored. They say the lists help victims identify each other so they can speak out together and find safety in numbers.[43][44] Sometimes these lists are kept for other reasons. For example, a spreadsheet from the United Kingdom called ""High Libido MPs"" and dubbed ""the spreadsheet of shame"" was created by a group of male and female Parliamentary researchers, and contained a list of allegations against nearly 40 Conservative MPs in the British Parliament. It is also rumored that party whips (who are in charge of getting members of Parliament to commit to votes) maintain a ""black book"" that contains allegations against several lawmakers that can be used for blackmail.[45][46][47] When it is claimed a well-known person's sexual misconduct was an ""open secret"", these lists are often the source.[43] In the wake of #MeToo, several private whisper network lists have been leaked to the public.[43][44]  In India, a student gave her friends a list containing names of professors and academics in the Indian university system to be avoided. The list went viral after it was posted on social media.[48] In response to criticism in the media, the authors defended themselves by saying they were only trying to warn their friends, had confirmed every case, and several victims from the list were poor students who had already been punished or ignored when trying to come forward.[49][50] Moira Donegan, a New York City-based journalist, privately shared a crowd-sourced list of ""Shitty Media Men"" to avoid in publishing and journalism. When it was shared outside her private network, Donegan lost her job. Donegan stated it was unfair so few people had access to the list before it went public; for example, very few women of color received access (and therefore protection) from it. She pointed to her ""whiteness, health, education, and class"" that allowed her to take the risk of sharing the list and getting fired.[44]  The main problem with trying to protect more potential victims by publishing whisper networks is determining the best mechanism to verify allegations in a way that is fair to all parties.[51][52] Some suggestions have included strengthening labor unions in vulnerable industries so workers can report harassment directly to the union instead of to an employer. Another suggestion is to maintain industry hotlines which have the power to trigger third-party investigations.[51] Several apps have been developed which offer various ways to report sexual misconduct, and some of these apps also have the ability to connect victims who have reported the same person.[53]  Issues with social norms  In the wake of #MeToo, many countries such as the U.S.,[54] India,[55] France,[56] China,[57] Japan,[41] and Italy,[58] have seen discussion in the media on whether cultural norms need to be changed for sexual harassment to be eradicated in the workplace.  Dr. John Launer of Health Education England stated leaders must be made aware of common ""mismatches of perceptions"" at work to reduce incidents where one person thinks they are flirting while the other person feels like they're being demeaned or harassed.[59] Reporter Anna North from Vox states one way to address #MeToo is teach children the basics of sex. North states the cultural notion that women do not enjoy sex leads men ""to believe that a lukewarm yes is all they're ever going to get"", referring to a 2017 study which found that men who believe women enjoy being forced into sex are ""more likely to perceive women as consenting"".[60] Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Post called for society to be careful of overreaching by ""being clear about what behavior is criminal, what behavior is legal but intolerable in a workplace, and what private intimate behavior is worthy of condemnation"" but not part of the workplace discussion. She says ""preserving the nuances"" is more inclusive and realistic.[61]  Professor Daniel Drezner stated that #MeToo laid the groundwork for two major cultural shifts. One is the acceptance that sexual harassment (not just sexual assault) is unacceptable in the workplace. The other is that when a powerful person is accused of sexual harassment, the reaction should be a presumption that the less powerful accuser is ""likely telling the truth, because the risks of going public are great."" However, he states society is struggling with the speed at which change is being demanded.[62]  Reform and implementation  Although #MeToo initially focused on adults, the message spread to students in K–12 schools where sexual abuse is common both in person and online.[63] MeTooK12 is a spin-off of #MeToo created in January 2018 by the group Stop Sexual Assault in Schools, founded by Joel Levin and Esther Warkov, aimed at stopping sexual abuse in education from kindergarten to high school.[64][65] #MeTooK12 was inspired in part by the removal of certain federal Title IX sexual misconduct guidelines.[66] There is evidence that sexual misconduct in K–12 education is dramatically underreported by both schools and students, because nearly 80% of public schools never report any incidents of harassment. A 2011 survey found 40% of boys and 56% of girls in grades 7–12 reported had experienced some type of negative sexual comment or sexual harassment in their lives.[64][66] Approximately 5% of K–12 sexual misconduct reports involved 5 or 6-year-old students. #MeTooK12 is meant to demonstrate the widespread prevalence of sexual misconduct towards children in school, and the need for increased training on Title IX policies, as only 18 states require people in education to receive training about what to do when a student or teacher is sexually abused.[65]  Role of men  There has been discussion about what possible roles men may have in the #MeToo movement.[67][68][69] It has been noted that 1 in 6 men have experienced sexual abuse of some sort during their lives and often feel unable to talk about it.[70] Creator Tarana Burke and others have asked men to call out bad behavior when they see it,[68][69] or just spend time quietly listening.[19][71] Some men have expressed the desire to keep a greater distance from women since #MeToo went viral because they do not fully understand what actions might be considered inappropriate.[72][73] For the first few months after #MeToo started trending, many men expressed difficulty in participating in the conversation due to fear of negative consequences, citing examples of men who have been treated negatively after sharing their thoughts about #MeToo.[74]  Author and former pick-up artist Michael Ellsberg encourages men to reflect on past behavior and examples of questionable sexual behavior, such as the viral story Cat Person, which is written from the perspective of a twenty-year-old woman who goes on a date with a much older man and ends up having an unpleasant sexual experience that was consensual but unwanted. Ellsberg has asked men to pledge to ensure women are mutually interested in initiating a sexual encounter and to slow down if there is ever doubt a woman wants to continue.[75][76]  Relationship instructor Kasia Urbaniak said the movement is creating its own crisis around masculinity. ""There's a reflective questioning about whether they’re going to be next and if they’ve ever hurt a woman. There's a level of anger and frustration. If you’ve been doing something wrong but haven't been told, there's an incredible sense of betrayal and it’ll provoke a backlash. I think silence on both sides is incredibly dangerous."" Urbaniak says she would like women to be allies of men and to be curious about their experience. ""In that alliance there's a lot more power and possibility than there is in men stepping aside and starting to stew.""[77]  In August 2018, The New York Times detailed allegations that leading #MeToo figure Asia Argento sexually assaulted actor Jimmy Bennett.[78] The sexual assault allegedly took place in a California hotel room in 2013 when he was only two months past his 17th birthday and she was 37; the age of consent in that state is 18.[78] Bennett said when Argento came out against Harvey Weinstein, it stirred memories of his own experience. He imparted he had sought to resolve the matter privately, and had not spoken out sooner, ""because I was ashamed and afraid to be part of the public narrative.""[79] In a statement provided to The Times, he said: ""I was underage when the event took place, and I tried to seek justice in a way that made sense to me at the time because I was not ready to deal with the ramifications of my story becoming public. At the time I believed there was still a stigma to being in the situation as a male in our society. I didn't think that people would understand the event that took place from the eyes of a teenage boy."" Bennett said he would like to ""move past this event in my life,"" adding, ""today I choose to move forward, no longer in silence.""[79] Argento, who quietly arranged a $380,000 nondisclosure settlement with Bennett in the months following her revelations regarding Weinstein, has denied the allegations.[80] Rose McGowan initially expressed support for Argento on and implored others to show restraint, tweeting, ""None of us know the truth of the situation and I'm sure more will be revealed. Be gentle."" As one of the most vocal advocates of the Me Too movement, McGowan faced criticism on social media for her comments, which conflicted with the movement's message of believing survivors.[81] MeToo founder Tarana Burke responded the Asia Argento report, stating ""I’ve said repeatedly that the #metooMVMT is for all of us, including these brave young men who are now coming forward. Sexual violence is about power and privilege. That doesn't change if the perpetrator is your favorite actress, activist or professor of any gender.""[3]  Timeline  2006 (Tarana Burke)  Tarana Burke, a social activist and community organizer, began using the phrase ""Me Too"" in 2006, on the Myspace social network[4] in order to promote ""empowerment through empathy"" among women of color who have been sexually abused.[14][82][83] Burke, who is creating a documentary titled Me Too, has said she was inspired to use the phrase after being unable to respond to a 13-year-old girl who confided to her that she had been sexually assaulted. Burke said she later wished she had simply told the girl: ""Me too"".[4][27]  2015 (Ambra Gutierrez)  In 2015 The New York Times reported that Weinstein was questioned by police ""after a 22-year-old woman accused him of touching her inappropriately.""[84] The woman, Italian model Ambra Gutierrez, cooperated with the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to obtain an audio recording where Weinstein admitted to having inappropriately touched her.[85] As the police investigation progressed and became public, tabloids published negative stories about Gutierrez that portrayed her as an opportunist.[86] American Media, publisher of the National Enquirer, allegedly agreed to help suppress the allegations by Gutierrez and Rose McGowan. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. decided not to file charges against Weinstein, citing insufficient evidence of criminal intent, against the advice of local police who considered the evidence sufficient.[87] The New York district attorney's office and the NYPD blamed each other for failing to bring charges.[87]  2016: Russia and Ukraine (Anastasia Melnichenko)  In July 2016, a social media post by Ukrainian journalist Anastasia Melnichenko went viral. Thousands of women, and some men, in Russia and Ukraine began posting their personal stories of sexual harassment and assault on social media using the hashtag #IAmNotAfraidToSpeak (#яНеБоюсьСказати‬ in Ukrainian; #яНеБоюсьСказать in Russian).[88][89][90][91] Her original post in Ukrainian[92] was about a sexual harassment in family, on the streets, with ex-boyfriend, but not in the workspace. Also she updated her post with the words: ""Цей допис писала, лютуючи на коменти чоловіків під цим дописом: <...>. Тому і дозволила собі досить агресивний випад у бік чоловіків вкінці посту. Звісно ж, не хотіла образити хороших і адекватних. Як з*ясувалося, їх більше, ніж я думала."" (""I wrote this post, raging at the comments of men under this post: <...> That is why I let myself aggressive enough attack towards men at the end of the post. Of course, I did not want to offend good and adequate ones. As it turned out, there are more of them than I thought."").[citation needed]  2017 (Alyssa Milano)  Following widespread exposure of accusations of predatory behavior by Harvey Weinstein, and her own blog post on the subject, on October 15, 2017, actress Alyssa Milano wrote: ""If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ as a reply to this tweet."", and reposted the following phrase suggested by a friend: ""If all the women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote ‘Me too.’ as a status, we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem."",[12][11] encouraging spreading the phrase ""Me Too."" to attempt to draw attention to sexual assault and harassment.[5][14] The next day, October 16, 2017, Milano wrote: ""I was just made aware of an earlier #MeToo movement, and the origin story is equal parts heartbreaking and inspiring"", providing the link to site of Ms. Burke.[4][27][93] Milano credits her identification with the Me Too movement to being personally affected by sexual harassment during a concert when she was 19.[94]  Several hashtags related to sharing stories of workplace sexual harassment were in use before #MeToo, including #MyHarveyWeinstein, #WhatWereYouWearing (on March 12, 2014 there was a question on Twitter ""What Were You Wearing When You Were Assaulted?"" and there were answers what they wore;[95] there were posts with the #whatwereyouwearing as late as of 2010, not related to any kind of sexual harassment or workplace[96][97][98]), #SurvivorPrivilege (in June 2014 the #SurvivorPrivilege was about alleged lies of rape survivors to get privileges and denial of that by females, especially by students[99]) and #YouOkSis (on August 2, 2014 there was #YouOkSis about street harassment[100]).[101][102][103]  Impact  US media and fashion industries  The phrase ""Me too"" was tweeted by Milano around noon on October 15, 2017, and had been used more than 200,000 times by the end of the day,[104] and tweeted more than 500,000 times by October 16.[105] On Facebook, the hashtag was used by more than 4.7 million people in 12 million posts during the first 24 hours.[27] The platform reported that 45% of users in the United States had a friend who had posted using the term.[106]  Tens of thousands of people, including hundreds of celebrities, replied with #MeToo stories.[107] Some men, such as actors Terry Crews[108] and James Van Der Beek,[109] have responded to the hashtag with their own experiences of harassment and abuse. Others have responded by acknowledging past behaviors against women, spawning the hashtag #HowIWillChange.[110]  In addition to Hollywood, ""Me Too"" declarations elicited discussion of sexual harassment and abuse in the music industry,[111] sciences,[112] academia,[113] and politics.[114]  Feminist author Gloria Feldt stated in Time that many employers are being forced to make changes in response to #MeToo, for example examining gender-based pay differences and improving sexual harassment policies.[115] Others have noted there has been pressure on companies, specifically in the financial industry, to disclose diversity statistics[clarification needed].[116]  In February 2019 actress Emma Thompson wrote a letter to the American production company Skydance Media, to explain that she had pulled out of the production of the animated feature film Luck the month prior because of the company's decision to hire Disney Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter,[117] who had been accused of harassing women while at Disney. His behavior resulted in his decision to take a six-month leave of absence from the company, as he indicated in a memo in which he acknowledged ""painful"" conversations and unspecified ""missteps.""[118]  Among others, Thompson stated: ""If a man has been touching women inappropriately for decades, why would a woman want to work for him if the only reason he’s not touching them inappropriately now is that it says in his contract that he must behave ""professionally""?[117]  The 2019 rerelease of Toy Story 2 had a blooper scene during the credits removed due to sexual misconduct concerns.[119]  Churches  In November 2017, the hashtag #ChurchToo was started by Emily Joy and Hannah Paasch on Twitter and began trending in response to #MeToo as a way to try to highlight and stop sexual abuse that happens in a church.[120][121] In early January 2018, about a hundred evangelical women also launched #SilenceIsNotSpiritual to call for changes to how sexual misconduct is dealt within the church.[122][123] #ChurchToo started spreading again virally later in January 2018 in response to a live-streamed video admission by Pastor Andy Savage to his church that he sexually assaulted a 17-year-old girl twenty years before as a youth pastor while driving her home, but then received applause by his church for admitting to the incident and asking for forgiveness. Pastor Andy Savage then resigned from his staff position at Highpoint Church and stepped away from ministry.[124][125][126] Many have argued that one of the biggest crises in the history of the Catholic Church is the current child sexual abuse that is being reported, according to Tom Inglis in his book Are the Irish Different?.[127]  Education  The University of California has been no stranger to sexual harassment, with substantial accusations reported yearly in the hundreds at all nine UC campuses, notably UC Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, and San Diego.[128] However, a landmark event at the University of California, Irvine spearheaded the removal and reprimand of several campus officials and professors accused of sexual harassment and discrimination. In early July 2018, UC Irvine removed millionaire benefactor Francisco J. Ayala's name from its biology school, central science library, graduate fellowships, scholar programs, and endowed chairs after an internal investigation substantiated a number of sexual harassment claims. The results from the investigation were compiled in a 97-page report, which included testimony from victims enduring Ayala's harassment for 15 years.[129][130][131][132][133][134][135] His removal promptly sparked the removal of Professor Ron Carlson in August 2018, who had led the creative writing program at UC Irvine. He resigned after substantiated reports of sexual misconduct with an underage student were unearthed.[136] UC Irvine upon learning about the report accepted Professor Carlson's immediate resignation.[137] Four additional professors in the School of Biological Sciences at UC Irvine between June and August 2018 were put under sanctions or terminated for violating the UC Policy on Sexual Harassment[citation needed]. Several claims were also reviewed against Thomas A. Parham, former vice chancellor at UC Irvine and former president of the Association of Black Psychologists.[138]  To address harassment within scientific settings, BethAnn McLaughlin started the #MeTooSTEM movement and hashtag.[139] She called for the National Institutes of Health to cut funding to anyone who has been found guilty of harassment charges.[139][140] McLaughlin shared the MIT Media Lab Disobedience Award with Tarana Burke and Sherry Marts for her work on Me Too in STEM.[141][142]  There are still many places of education such as high schools, however, where legal intervention is not readily enforced for situations where sexual assault takes place. Pamela Y. Price in her book Directions in Sexual Harassment Law describes how ""a major argument for why [laws against] sexual harassment won't work in education is that issues of sexuality can't be regulated (similar to the debate in employment) or that adolescent behavior is too unpredictable to be legally controlled"" (Price 62).[143]  Finance  It has been noted that, although the financial industry is known to have a wide prevalence of sexual harassment,[144] as of January 2018, there were no high-profile financial executives stepping down as the result of #MeToo allegations.[145] The first widely covered example of concrete consequences in finance was when two reporters, including Madison Marriage of the Financial Times, went undercover at a men-only Presidents Club event meant to raise money for children. Because women were not allowed to attend except as ""hostesses"" in tight, short black dresses with black underwear, Financial Times reporter Madison Marriage and another reporter got jobs as hostesses and documented widespread sexual misconduct. As a result, The Presidents Club was shut down.[145]  In March 2018, Morgan Stanley broker Douglas E. Greenberg was put on administrative leave after a New York Times story outlined harassment allegations by four women, including multiple arrests for the violation of restraining orders, and a threat to burn down an ex-girlfriend's house. It has been called the #MeToo moment of Portland's financial service industry.[146]  Only about a quarter of top positions are held by women at several major banks, and there is evidence there may be wide disparities in some financial institutions between how much men and women are paid on average.[116][relevant? – discuss]  The authors of a December 2018 Bloomberg News article on this topic interviewed more than thirty senior Wall Street executives and found that many are now more cautious about mentoring up and coming female executives because of the perceived risks involved. One said, ""If men avoid working or traveling with women alone, or stop mentoring women for fear of being accused of sexual harassment, those men are going to back out of a sexual harassment complaint and right into a sex discrimination complaint.""[147]  Politics and government  Statehouses in California, Illinois, Oregon, and Rhode Island responded to allegations of sexual harassment surfaced by the campaign,[148] and several women in politics spoke out about their experiences of sexual harassment, including United States Senators Heidi Heitkamp, Mazie Hirono, Claire McCaskill and Elizabeth Warren.[114] Congresswoman Jackie Speier has introduced a bill aimed at making sexual harassment complaints easier to report on Capitol Hill.[149] The accusations in the world of Spanish politics have also been published in the media,[150] and a series of allegations and research on MPs and political figures of (all major British political parties) regarding sexual impropriety became a nationwide scandal in 2017; this research was undertaken in the aftermath of the Weinstein scandal and the Me Too movement.[151][152][153]  Detective Leslie Branch-Wise of the Denver Police Department spoke publicly for the first time in 2018 about experiencing sexual harassment by Denver Mayor Michael B. Hancock. The detective provided sexually suggestive text messages from Hancock sent to her while working for Hancock's security detail in 2012. After six years of keeping the secret, Detective Branch-Wise credited the Me Too movement as an inspiration to share her experience.[154]  Congressman John Conyers was the first sitting United States politician to resign in the wake of #MeToo.[155][156][157] Later in 2019, Katie Hill resigned from Congress[158] due to an affair with a staffer after the House Ethics Committee opened an investigation into her conduct, stemming from these new rules.[159]  ME TOO bill in U.S. Congress  Jackie Speier proposed the Member and Employee Training and Oversight on Congress Act (ME TOO Congress Act) on November 15, 2017.[160] The full language of the bipartisan bill was revealed by the House on January 18, 2018 as an amendment to the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995.[161] The purpose of the bill is to change how the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government treats sexual harassment complaints. Under the old system, complaints regarding the legislative branch were channeled through the Office of Compliance, which required complete confidentially through the process and took months of counseling and mediation before a complaint could actually be filed. Any settlement payments were paid using federal taxes, and it was reported that within a decade, $15 million of tax money had been spent settling harassment and discrimination complaints. The bill would ensure future complaints could only take up to 180 days to be filed. The bill would also allow the staffers to transfer to a different department or otherwise work away from the presence of the alleged harasser without losing their jobs if they requested it. The bill would require Representatives and Senators to pay for their own harassment settlements. The Office of Compliance would no longer be allowed to keep settlements secret, and would be required to publicly publish the settlement amounts and the associated employing offices. For the first time, the same protections would also apply to unpaid workers, including pages, fellows and interns.[162][163][164]  Silicon Valley  In the months preceding the NY Times story on Harvey Weinstein, Travis Kalanick (CEO of Uber at the time) came under fire for enabling a misogynist culture at the company, and having extensive knowledge of sexual harassment complaints at the company, while failing to do anything about them.[165] After an initial blog post by a former Uber Engineer detailed her experiences at the company, more employees came out with their own stories, as documented in a follow-up article by the NY Times in late February 2017. In it, they detail how they had notified senior management including Kalanick about incidents of sexual harassment, and that their complaints had gone ignored.[166] A few months later, in June 2017, Kalanick himself came under allegations of sexual harassment, as it was reported that he visited an escort bar in Seoul, bringing fellow female employees of the company along with him.[167] One of the female employees filed a complaint to Human Resources about how she felt forced to be there, and was very uncomfortable in that environment, where women were made to wear tags with numbers on them, as if in an auction.[168] Fresh allegations of sexual harassment at the company surfaced one year later, implicating Uber's Corporate Development Executive Cameron Poetzscher. The allegations made it clear that Uber was not taking this issue seriously enough.[169]  On October 25, 2018, the New York Times released a detailed report on the prior behavior of Andy Rubin at Google. The allegations cite that Google knew of a sexual misconduct claim against Rubin, and yet still decided to pay him a $90 million separation package at his departure from the company.[170]  Sports  Soon after #MeToo started spreading in late 2017, several allegations from a 2016 Indianapolis Star article resurfaced in the gymnastic industry against former U.S. Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar of Michigan State University. Nassar was called out via #MeToo for sexually assaulting gymnasts as young as 6 years old during ""treatments"".[171] Rachael Denhollander was the first to call him out.[172] Though nothing was done after the initial allegations came out in 2016, after more than 150 women came forward, Nassar was effectively sentenced to life in prison. The president of Michigan State University, Lou Anna Simon, resigned in the wake of the scandal.[171]  At around the same time, WNBA star Breanna Stewart publicly revealed that she had been a victim of child sexual abuse from age 9 to 11.[173]  In late November 2017, Lui Lai Yiu, a hurdler from Hong Kong, recounted in a Facebook post instances of having been sexually assaulted by her male coach when she was 14, sparking off mass controversy in Hong Kong.[174] Her coach was arrested in late January 2018,[175] but acquitted in mid-November 2018.[176]  In 1996, while attending the University of Tennessee, former American football player Peyton Manning was accused of sexual assault by trainer Jamie Ann Naughright after he pressed his genitals against Naughright's face during a foot examination. Manning claims that he was just pulling a prank by ""mooning"" another athlete in the room as Naughright bent over to examine him. Both Naughright and the other athlete deny Manning's story. Naughright settled with the university for $300,000 for its alleged failure in four incidents, and resigned from the school. She had initially made a list of 33 complaints about the school.[177] Naughright filed a defamation lawsuit against Peyton Manning and three other parties in 2002. Manning defamed her in a book he wrote with his father and author John Underwood. The lawsuit was settled after the court ruled there was sufficient evidence for it to be heard by a jury. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed due to confidentiality terms.[178][179]  Medicine  MeToo has encouraged discussion about sexual harassment in the medical field.[59][180][181] Research had indicated that among U.S. academic medical faculty members, about 30% of women and 4% of men have reported experiencing sexual harassment, and it has been noted that medical staff who complain often receive negative consequences to their careers.[69][181] Other evidence has indicated 60% of medical trainees and students experienced harassment or discrimination during training, though most do not report the incidents.[59]  Music  Several prominent musicians have expressed support for the Me Too movement and have shared their own experiences of sexual assault and harassment.  Before the Me Too Movement, in 2017, Jessie Reyez released the song ""Gatekeeper"" about her experience of harassment by a famous producer, describing the conversations men in power have with young women working in the music industry.[182] This song inspired female artists in the music industry to speak up against sexual harassment, contributing to the start of the Me Too movement.[183]  Actress Alyssa Milano's activism for the Me Too movement began because she was harassed at the age of 19 during a concert.[184] On October 15, 2017, she started a viral twitter thread by tweeting ""If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ as a reply to this tweet."" Musicians such as Sheryl Crow, Christina Perri and Lady Gaga responded and contributed their own personal experiences.[185]  Amanda Palmer and songwriter Jasmine Power composed ""Mr. Weinstein Will See You Now"", a song that takes listeners through a story of a woman being invited to the office of a man in power.[186] A music video with an all-woman crew, cast and production team was released on the anniversary of the New York Times's reporting on sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein, with profits donated to #TimesUp, a movement against sexual harassment.[187]  The band Veruca Salt used the #MeToo hashtag to air allegations of sexual harassment against James Toback,[188] and singer-songwriter Alice Glass used the hashtag to share a history of alleged sexual assault and other abuses by former Crystal Castles bandmate Ethan Kath.[189][190]  Singer Halsey wrote a poem, ""A Story Like Mine"", which she delivered at a 2018 Women's march in New York City. The poem describes incidents of sexual assault and violence throughout her life, including accompanying her best friend to Planned Parenthood after she had been raped and her personal experiences of sexual assault by neighbors and boyfriends.[191]  Allegations against figures in the music industry  In January 2019, the Lifetime documentary Surviving R. Kelly aired, describing several women's accusations of sexual, emotional, mental, and physical abuse by singer R. Kelly. The documentary questioned the ""ecosystem"" that ""supports and enables"" powerful individuals in the music industry.[192] In February 2019, Kelly was arrested for 10 alleged counts of sexual abuse against four women, three of whom were minors at the time of the incidents.[193] His former wife Andrea Kelly has also accused him of domestic violence and filed a restraining order against him in 2005.[194]  Singer Kesha has accused her former producer Dr. Luke of sexually, physically, and emotionally abusing her since the beginning of her music career.[195] Dr. Luke denied the allegations and a judge refused her request to be released from a contract with Sony Music due to the alleged abuse.[196] Kesha described her response to this experience in the song ""Praying"", which she performed at the 2018 Grammys. The song was seen as offering encouragement to sexual assault survivors that the world can improve.[197]  A documentary was also instrumental in publicizing accusations in the case of late singer Michael Jackson. Child sexual abuse allegations against Jackson were renewed after the airing of the documentary Leaving Neverland in 2019. The documentary focuses on Wade Robson and James Safechuck and their interactions with Jackson, especially the sexual interactions they say they endured for years during their childhood.[198] Both had previously testified in Jackson's defense — Safechuck as a child during the 1993 investigation, Robson both as a child in 1993 and as a young adult in 2005.[199][200] In 2015, Robson's case against Jackson's estate was dismissed on the grounds that it was filed too late.[201][202][203] The documentary resulted in a backlash against Jackson and a reassessment of his legacy in some quarters, while other viewers dismissed it as one-sided, questioned its veracity and viewed it as unconvincing due to factual conflicts between the film and the 1993 and 2005 allegations against Jackson, and his acquittal at trial.[204]  In 2020, it was revealed that rape allegations were made against former Recording Academy President, Neil Portnow.[205]  Removal of music  In November 2018, Cleveland, Ohio radio station WDOK Star 102 announced that it had removed the song ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"" from its playlist because listeners felt that the lyrics were inappropriate. The station's host commented that ""in a world where #MeToo has finally given women the voice they deserve, the song has no place"".[206] The streaming service Spotify removed music by XXXTentacion and R. Kelly from Spotify-owned playlists after allegations of ""hateful conduct"",[183][207] but later reversed course due to the fact that the allegations against the artists were unproven.[208]  Social justice and journalism  Sarah Lyons wrote ""Hands Off Pants On"", in which she explained the importance of allowing an open space for victims of sexual assault in the work place to heal.[209] Sarah Jaffe analyzed the issues facing victims who follow through with police departments and the court system.[210]  Military  In the wake of #MeToo, #MeTooMilitary came to be used by service men and women who were sexually assaulted or harassed while in the military,[211] appearing on social media in January 2018 the day after remarks by Oprah Winfrey at the Golden Globe Awards honoring female soldiers in the military ""whose names we'll never know"" who have suffered sexual assault and abuse in order to make things better for women today.[212]  A report from the Pentagon indicated that 15,000 members of the military reported being sexually assaulted in the year 2016 and only 1 out of 3 people assaulted actually made a report.[213] Veteran Nichole Bowen-Crawford has said the rates have improved over the last decade, but the military still has a long way to go, and recommends that women veterans connect privately on social media to discuss sexual abuse in a safe environment.[212][214]  There was a ""#MeTooMilitary Stand Down"" protest, organized by Service Women's Action Network, which gathered at the Pentagon on January 8, 2018. The protest was endorsed by the U.S. Department of Defense, who stated that current service members were welcome to attend as long as they did not wear their uniform.[215][216][217] The protest supported the Military Justice Improvement Act, sponsored by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, which would move ""the decision over whether to prosecute serious [sex] crimes to independent, trained, professional military prosecutors, while leaving uniquely military crimes within the chain of command"".[216]  Pornography  There have been discussions about how pornography is related to the emergence of the #MeToo movement, and what changes, if any, should be made to the porn industry in response.[218][219] The deaths of five female porn actresses during the first three months of 2018 inspired demands that workers in the industry be included as part of the #MeToo movement.[220] It has been pointed out that many women and men have been sexually assaulted on set.[221] Some high-profile pornographic performers have been accused of assault since the emergence of #MeToo, including James Deen and Ron Jeremy.[220][222][223] The porn industry has overall been publicly supportive of #MeToo, with the topics of harassment and bodily autonomy being addressed at the 2018 AVN Awards.[224] There have been calls for the industry to police itself better in the wake of #MeToo.[221] However, when gay actor Tegan Zayne accused fellow actor Topher DiMaggio of rape in a #MeToo post, and four other men came forward with their own allegations of sexual misconduct against DiMaggio, very little happened and there was no official investigation.[225]  Several groups of Christians, conservative women, and radical feminists have argued that #MeToo demonstrates pornography causes women to be viewed as sexual objects and contributes to the prevalence of sexual harassment. As a result, these groups believe the production and consumption of pornography should be greatly restricted or made illegal.[218]  Other social advocates and feminists have responded by pointing out that attempts to suppress pornography in the U.S. have historically never been effective at reducing consumption. They note that porn consumption in the U.S. is currently at what is likely the highest levels in history, but overall levels of sexual violence and rape are far lower today than when the anti-pornography movement in the U.S. first emerged during the 1960s. Additionally, many feminists argue that laws which make pornography illegal only further restrict women as far what they are and are not allowed to do with their bodies.[218]  Many feminists have stated that pornography can be empowering or enjoyable for women and depicting female sexuality is not always objectification.[218][226] Others point out that a lot of porn is made by women and for women.[227] Award-winning porn actress and director Angela White says there is a ""large positive shift within the industry"" to more women directing and producing their own content and ""to represent women as powerful sexual beings.""[220] Anti-porn activist Melissa Farley has said this ignores the ""choicelessness"" faced by many actresses in porn.[218] Liberal advocates argue that anti-pornography movements in the U.S. have historically never tried to increase choices for vulnerable adult performers, and taking away a person's right to act in porn may hurt them economically by reducing their choices. Many adult performers have stated that the social stigma surrounding their type of work is already a major barrier when they're seeking help, and making porn illegal would leave them few options if they are suffering from sexual abuse.[220]  As a result of #MeToo, many adult performers, sex worker advocates and feminists have called for greater protections for pornographic actresses, for example reducing social stigmas, mandating training courses that teach performers their rights, and providing access to independent hotlines where performers can report abuse. They argue that making porn illegal would only cause the production of porn to go underground where there are even fewer options for help. Some liberal activists have argued to compromise by raising the legal age of entry into adult entertainment from 18 to 21, which would prevent some of the most vulnerable women from being taken advantage of, while allowing adult women to still do what they want with their own bodies.[220]  Some have pointed out that many young people who do not receive a sex education adopt ideas about sex and sexual roles from pornography, whose fantasy depictions of those behaviors are not accurate to life, as they are designed for purposes of adult entertainment, and not educating the public on the reality of sexual behavior.[228] Some areas of the United States teach birth-control methods only by abstinence from sex. In a 2015 article for the American Journal of Nursing David Carter noted that a study found that abstinence-based education was ""correlated with increases in teenage pregnancies and births"". Multiple people have voiced support for comprehensive sex education programs that encompass a wide range topics, which they state leave children more informed.[229] Several feminists have argued it is crucial to provide children with basic sex education before they are inevitably exposed to porn. Sex education can also effectively prepare children to identify and say no to unwanted sexual contact before it occurs, and gives parents an opportunity to teach children about consent.[230]  Animal advocacy  The #MeToo movement has had an impact on the field of animal advocacy. For instance, on January 30, 2018, Politico published an article titled, ""Female Employees Allege Culture of Sexual Harassment at Humane Society: Two senior officials, including the CEO, have been investigated for incidents dating back over a decade.""[231] The article concerned allegations against then- Humane Society of the United States CEO, Wayne Pacelle; and a well-known animal protection activist named Paul Shapiro.[231] Mr. Pacelle soon resigned.[232] Mr. Shapiro also soon left the Humane Society of the United States.[233] Both men have nonetheless continued to hold leadership positions either in, or adjacent to, the animal protection movement.[234][235]  Astronomy  The #astroSH twitter tag was used to discuss sexual harassment in the field of Astronomy, and several scientists and professors resigned or were fired.[236][237][238][239]  Financial support  In May 2018, The New York Women's Foundation announced their Fund to Support the Me Too Movement and Allies, a $25M commitment over the next five years to provide funding and support survivors of sexual violence.[240]  In September 2018, CBS announced that it would be donating $20 million of former Chairman Les Moonves' severance to #MeToo. Moonves was forced to step down after numerous sexual misconduct accusations.[241][242]  International response  The hashtag has trended in at least 85 countries,[243] including India, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom. Direct translations of #MeToo have been shared by Spanish speakers in South America and Europe and by Arabic speakers in Africa and the Middle East, while activists in France and Italy have developed hashtags to express the attitudes of the movement.[244] Communicating similar experiences and ""sharing feelings in some form of togetherness"" connects people and can lead to ""formation of a process of collective action"" (Castells).[245][246] The campaign has prompted survivors from around the world to share their stories, and name their perpetrators. The European Parliament convened a session directly in response to the Me Too campaign, after it gave rise to allegations of abuse in Parliament and in the European Union's offices in Brussels. Cecilia Malmström, the European Commissioner for Trade, specifically cited the hashtag as the reason the meeting had been convened.[247]  Afghanistan  The #MeToo hashtag initially spread in Afghanistan where it is estimated about 90% of women experience sexual harassment in public, at school, or at work, but was quickly silenced when those who shared their stories started fearing for their life.[248][249] Less than 1% of police officers or military members are women, and sexual assault is often ignored by law enforcement and the military.[250] Rape threats and other types of harassment are common on Facebook and other social media in Afghanistan. Sharing stories of sexual abuse against higher-ranking men is especially dangerous for women in the country, and may result in the killing of the victim or her family members.[249] Some women are also punished or killed to by their own family for speaking out, to redeem their ""honor"" after being tarnished by rape.[249] Despite the risks, some notable people such as Sarienews journalist Maryam Mehtar, and presidential advisor Shaharzad Akbar have shared their own #MeToo stories on social media. Mehtar experienced extreme abuse and several death threats for sharing her story about being sexually harassed in public on a daily basis, and was publicly called a ""whore"" in an interview with The New York Times by Afghan writer Jalil Junbish. He also called the NYT reporter a whore in the same interview. He later denied making the comments.[250] Other women only share their first name or a fake name, and typically describe the story without naming the perpetrator for fear of reprisal.[250] Sexual harassment was first defined in Afghanistan in 2016, though there has been little effort made to enforce laws against it.[248] Rod Nordland and Fatima Faizi of The New York Times reported that a colonel in the Afghan Air Force was secretly and clearly videotaped sexually assaulting a subordinate in November 2017, and the video quickly went viral, but despite an alleged investigation, the colonel has not been formally accused of misconduct.[250] The Ministries of Interior and Communications set up a phone hotline to for women to call to report sexual misconduct from law enforcement officials, but a call to the line revealed the hotline will offer advice only about phone harassment, and stated if a person harasses you in person, to ""slap them"".[250]  Australia  In October 2017 reporter and journalist Tracey Spicer announced on Twitter that she was launching an investigation into reports of sexual harassment by powerful Australian men in the media in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations and the rise in public awareness of the #MeToo movement. Earlier that same year, Spicer had released a memoir, The Good Girl Stripped Bare, where she wrote about her own experiences of sexual harassment in the work place.[251] Spicer later reported that she had received responses from 470 people about people in the industry, including Australian television presenter and producer Don Burke.[252] The extent of the claims against Burke were published by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and The Sydney Morning Herald in a joint investigative piece on November 26, 2017, where it was reported that ""One name kept recurring – Don Burke.""[253][254] Spicer, along with Kate McClymont, Lorna Knowles and Alison Branley, won the 2018 Walkley Awards in the print/text journalism and Television/Video Current Affairs Short (less than 20 minutes) categories for their investigation and on Australia Day in 2018, Spicer was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia ""for significant service to the broadcast media as a journalist and television presenter, and as an ambassador for social welfare and charitable groups"".[255][256] Later that same year, Spicer and Melinda Schneider launched NOW Australia, a campaign aimed at helping connect people with legal support and counselling.[257]  Since then the #MeToo movement has now expanded beyond Australian media and the Australian Human Rights Commission has launched an independent search into workplace sexual harassment that is the first of its kind in the world.[258]  It has been hypothesised by The Age that Australia's strict defamation laws make it difficult for more victims to come forward.[259] Yael Stone made an accusation against Geoffrey Rush[260][261] who then successfully sued her for defamation; this may have a chilling effect on the #MeToo movement due to the lack of protection for freedom of speech.[262]  The #MeToo movement was announced the winner of the 2019 Sydney Peace Prize. The award will be presented to Tarana Burke and Tracey Spicer on November 14, 2019.[263]  Belgium  In May 2019, Julie Van Espen was the victim of a homicide in Antwerp. Her death has led to political protests against sexual violence. That month, over 15,000 people walked a 'silent march' in Antwerp for Van Espen. The hashtags '#enough', '#MeToo' and '#JulieVanEspen' were used by people on social media to command attention to the case, to raise awareness on sexual violence, and to address that the suspect of her murder had been convicted of rape twice before.[264]  Canada  Éric Salvail, accused of sexual harassment  In French-speaking parts of Canada, the campaign is done under the hashtag #MoiAussi.[265] A minister of Quebec, Hélène David, said she believed a global movement was in the works and we should salute this change.[266] It was reported that calls to rape and women's crisis centers have increased dramatically, up to 553% above normal levels,[267] since #MoiAussi started trending in October 2017, causing problems with staffing and budgeting.[268] Quebec has contributed $1 million to help support these crisis hotlines.[267] Hundreds of people marched to promote #MoiAussi at an event in Toronto in December 2017.[269] In the wake of #MoiAussi, a candidate for mayor of Plateau-Mont-Royal dropped out of the race in response to allegations of sexual misconduct from several women.[270] Montreal police set up a phone hotline for people who have been raped or harassed to call.[266] Radio and TV presenter Éric Salvail was accused by 11 people of either being sexually harassed, or witnessing harassment from Salvail.[266] He lost several endorsements and was suspended from most projects he was involved with.[271] Humorist Gilbert Rozon resigned from all his positions and tried to sell his company in the wake of several sexual misconduct allegations, including one from producer Julie Snyder, a class action lawsuit from several women, and a sexual assault report filed with the police.  A newly popular hashtag, #EtMaintenant (#AndNow or Now What?) has started spreading as the ""second part"" to #MoiAussi to discuss what to do now that the magnitude of the problem with sexual misconduct in the workplace has been exposed. #EtMaintenant is represented by a yellow heart. It was unveiled on the show Tout le monde en parle in January 2018, with the stated purpose of determining which attitudes related to society, politics, institutions, and media need to be changed to ensure equity between all people.[272]  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been a vocal advocate and supporter of the #MeToo movement. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in January 2018, Trudeau called for critical discussion on issues brought up by the #MeToo, Time's Up, and Women's March movements.[273] Trudeau has also advocated and acted upon a high standard set for himself and members of his government. Trudeau stated that he holds a ""zero tolerance for sexual assault, harassment or other forms of misconduct by his employees or caucus colleagues"".[274] As leader of the Liberal party, Trudeau initiated investigations on several members of parliament resulting in the dismissal of cabinet minister Kent Hehr, the resignation of MP Darshan Kang, and the suspension and later expulsion of MPs Scott Andrews and Massimo Pacetti.[275] In an interview, Trudeau explained that the zero tolerance standard applied to himself as well and stated, ""I've been very, very careful all my life to be thoughtful, to be respectful of people's space and people's headspace as well.""[276]  However, an editorial written in August 2000 resurfaced during his premiership regarding an alleged incident where an author accused Trudeau of groping a reporter and in July 2018 Trudeau publicly rejected the accusations.[277][278] The piece stated Trudeau provided a ""day-late"" apology to the reporter, saying, ""If I had known you were reporting for a national paper, I never would have been so forward.""[279] On July 6 Trudeau stated there was no need to conduct an investigation into the allegations against him.[280]  Chile  In April–June 2018, female students marched around Chile and occupied universities in protest against sexual harassment.[281] Multiple actresses levelled accusations of Weinstein-like behaviour at telenovela director Herval Abreu in April and film director Nicolás López in June; both men have denied any wrongdoing.[282]  China  On Chinese social networks, hashtags #WoYeShi or #metoo are sometimes used to denote the #Metoo hashtag. Mi tu pronounced in Mandarin, meaning ""rice bunny"", is also used with a hashtag of #RiceBunny.[283]  In mainland China, the Chinese internet censorship service has slowed down the Chinese MeToo posts via censorship.[284] So far, the #MeToo debate appears to be limited to universities.[285]  An article appearing on the state-run China Daily newspaper states that sexual misconduct is rare in China due to superior education and culture has caused considerable Internet outrages.[286]  A recent study from a pair of professors from City University of Hong Kong indicated that about 80% of working women in China have experienced sexual harassment at some point in their career,[287] and there were strong reactions of anger online following the report. The article has since been taken down.[288] Activist Feng Yuan points out that China does not have national laws prohibiting sexual harassment, and uses state media to encourage women to focus on family and stay home. New laws recently made it illegal for television programming to contain images of a women's cleavage, sexual acts outside of marriage, or any topics that present ""Western lifestyles"" in a positive light. #MeToo has received extreme governmental censorship online.[57][288]  Sophie Richardson, the Human Rights Watch director for China, stated the Chinese government regularly suppresses discussion of women's rights, for example an incident in 2015 where Li Tingting and four other activists were arrested when the government learned they planned to hand out stickers about preventing sexual harassment on public transportation.[288]  In Hong Kong, track and field athlete Vera Lui Lai-Yiu posted her case of sex abuse alongside #metoo on her Facebook fanpage on her 23rd birthday. She posted in response to a similar action by gymnast McKayla Maroney. Lui posted a picture of herself holding a piece of paper with the handwritten words ""#metoo lly"" (her initials).[289][290][291][292][293] In January 2018, student Zheng Xi publicly started a campaign against sexual harassment in response to #MeToo.[287]  Dr. Luo Xixi, an academic, revealed being sexually assaulted by a professor at Beihang University when she was in her 20s. Luo gathered extensive evidence from many women, including recordings, and presented it to the institution. She waited until the professor was already suspended before going public with the story. Her post was viewed over 3 million times within 24 hours. She said that #metoo gave her the courage to speak up. She is currently living in the US.[57]  Zhou Xiaoxuan, a 25-year-old screenwriter in Beijing, stated that the China Central Television host and anchor Zhu Jun assaulted her in his dressing room while she was an intern of his in 2014. When she went to the police, she was urged her to drop her report, telling her that her parents, who both work for government institutions, could lose their jobs. So for years, Ms. Zhou kept what had happened a secret, only known by herself, her parents, and some close friends. That was until one day, where she saw a ""#MeToo"" post, and decided to share her own story. Her intentions were to share with her friends that this happens to people close to themselves, but instead her post was shared rapidly over the Chinese internet, until the Chinese government intervened and banned state-run media from covering the story.[294]  Yue Xin, an undergraduate of Peking University in Beijing, led a campaign to uncover information regarding the alleged assault and subsequent suicide of Gao Yan, a student who was allegedly assaulted by former professor Shang Yang.[295] Peking University took measures to attempt to dissuade Yue from pursuing her investigation.[296][297] Yue Xin would eventually participate in the Jasic Incident.  Ethiopia  Alyssa Milano specifically called for supporting the victims in Ethiopia in an interview with Rolling Stone.[31] In Ethiopia, up to 40% of students may have experienced sexual violence.[298] In November 2017, nine middle-school aged girls organized together and spoke out about an abusive teacher in their school, saying they got the idea from the ""Me Too"" movement. The teacher was dismissed and referred to law enforcement. UNICEF's Amanda Westfall said the teacher likely would have gotten away with it just a few years ago.[298]  France  Variants of the phrase trended in France,[104] especially #BalanceTonPorc (#DenounceYourPig),[265] which encouraged users to share the names of their alleged abusers.[299][300] #BalanceTonPorc was first used by Sandra Muller. She was requested to take down her tweet by two lawyers.[301] In France, 93% of complaints against criminal sexual harassment are dropped or never followed up on by law enforcement.[302] Prosecutions are extremely rare, and only 65 of 1,048 sexual harassment lawsuits from 2014 actually led to a conviction.[301] In 40% of workplace sexual violence cases, the person who makes the complaint is reprimanded or fired, while the accused person is typically not investigated or punished.[302] There is no French equivalent to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which gives victims a place to report workplace sexual violence if the employer and/or law enforcement refuses to address the complaint.[302] Brigitte Macron, wife of French President Emmanuel Macron, expressed support for the #MeToo movement.[301][303]  Initially the hashtag went viral, but there was an almost immediate media backlash.[304] Soon after, 100 high-profile French women, including actress Catherine Deneuve, former pornographic actress and radio host Brigitte Lahaie, art critic and author Catherine Millet, signed an open letter by Abnousse Shalmani which criticized the #MeToo / #BalanceTonPorc campaign. It was noted the letter is poorly edited with several typos and unclear or clumsy passages.[56][305]  The people who signed the letter, especially Deneuve and Millet, were criticized for saying men should have the ""right to pester"" women.[306] The letter also told people not to be bothered by small amounts of sexual harassment, for example men who rub against women on public transportation. The letter states women should ""consider it as the expression of a great sexual misery, or even as a nonevent"".[305] French politician Marlène Schiappa said some aspects of the letter were ""profoundly shocking"" and ""we have immense difficulty convincing young women that when a man rubs his genitals against a woman in the Métro without her consent, it is an act of sexual assault that can lead to three years in prison and a 75,000 euro fine.""[301][305]  A week after its publication, Deneuve issued a letter of clarification, and said although she still agrees with the spirit of the original letter, she wants to clarify that she does believe sexual harassment and assault are real problems, and apologized to all victims of unpleasant sexual acts who read the letter and felt hurt by it.[307][308]  Political commentator Anastasia Colosimo said the movement to prevent sexual misconduct at work is more accepted by younger women in France because they take sexual freedom as a given, while older feminists are afraid #MeToo may hurt the sexual revolution.[56] Legal professional Marilyn Baldeck noted that when people are given ""concrete examples"" of sexual misconduct, they often ""change their minds and acknowledge how harmful some situations can be"".[305] French politician Sandrine Rousseau said that the #MeToo movement will continue because French women have been silenced for too long.[301] A petition aimed at President Emmanuel Macron demanded sexual harassment to be taken more seriously in France, and received more than 100,000 signatures in three days.[302]  Singer Tom Connan said in an interview published by L'Obs that he had been the victim of sexual harassment and claimed that men (not only women) were also affected by the problem.[309]  NousToutes  In 2018, 30,000 women marched in Paris with the #NousToutes, dressing in purple.[310][311]  Tens of thousand of men and women demonstrated on November 23, 2019 in more than 30 cities.[312]  Ligue du LOL  In February 2019 prominent male Parisian journalists were accused of forming a group, called the ""Ligue du LOL"", which – over a 10-year period – ran online harassment campaigns against feminists, female journalists, writers of colour and gay people. The group's founder, Vincent Glad [fr], was suspended by the daily newspaper Libération, whose own fact-checking unit broke the story.  The NGO SOS Racisme called for a judicial investigation.[313][314]  Germany  MeToo was not particularly popular in Germany until January 11, 2018, when it started trending after the Die Zeit weekly newspaper published reports about three German former actresses who alleged that award-winning TV director Dieter Wedel had committed sexual assault.[315][316] There have been official concerns about the alleged long-time coverup of Wedel's actions because most of his work was done through public broadcasting and received government money.[316] The report detailed a months-long investigation into the three allegations, and included 50 interviews.[315] Wedel has not responded to the allegations in Die Zeit, stating through a spokesperson he is in the hospital and having heart trouble.[316] Another high-profile German case concerned the former president of the Munich Academy of Music, Siegfried Mauser.[317] In a study of 2000 Germans conducted after the initial spread of #MeToo, it was found that 43% of women and 12% of men have experienced sexual harassment or abuse, most commonly inappropriate touching.[318]  Iran  In the Islamic Republic of Iran, Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a message stating the ""disaster of countless sexual assaults on Western women – including incidents leading to #Metoo campaign"" can be solved with the Islamic solution of hijab.[319][320]  India  The use of the #MeToo hashtag on social media spread quickly in India,[321][322] where sexual harassment is commonly referred to by the word 'eve-teasing', a term described as misleading, tame, and diluting the seriousness of the crime.[323] In response to #MeToo, there have been attempts to teach Indian women about workplace rights and safe reporting, as well as educate men about the scope of the problem.[321][324] Some have likened #MeToo to a 2012 social movement which followed a violent gang rape in New Delhi that later resulted in a woman's death, which caused the Indian government to institute harsher punishments for rape.[322][325][326] Others have suggested there was underlying public anger over a Delhi rape conviction that was overturned by Judge Ashutosh Kumar a month before against filmmaker and writer Mahmood Farooqui, ruling that a ""feeble"" no was not enough to revoke consent because it was typical for one partner to be less willing. The case is being appealed to the Supreme Court.[325][327] Activist Jasmeen Patheja, head of Blank Noise, stated #MeToo's power is in demonstrating India can no longer ignore the scope of the problem.[322] Kaimini Jaiswal, a lawyer at the Supreme Court of India, stressed the importance of teaching women how to read, especially in rural villages, because most women in these areas are illiterate and completely financially and emotionally dependent on a male relative.[326]  Blogger Sheena Dabholkar's viral #MeToo tweet resulted in the boycott of Khodu Irani's popular Pune pub, High Spirits, by several well-known performers.[321][328][329] Several women mentioned Mahesh Murthy, which initiated a police case in January 2018.[330][331] The Trends Desk of The Indian Express wrote many Indian men are speaking up as a part of #MeToo, including discussions about consent and how some men are also abused.[332][333] Rina Chandran of Reuters said that #MeToo is ignoring the 600,000 women in India who are currently involuntary sex workers, and are typically poor, uneducated or lack a family.[334]  There were reports of mass sexual assaults during the 2018 new year's celebrations in Bangalore, which have been associated with #MeToo. The incidents were initially dismissed by the police until someone uploaded CCTV footage of the assaults to social media.[326] Home Minister G. Parameshwara, Abu Azmi, and other officials came under fire for stating ""western"" women's clothing and values were the cause of the rapes and that women's families should not allow them to go to parties or major celebrations.[326]  Several lists of alleged rapists and harassers started spreading on social media in India, including ""The List"" which initially included the names of about sixty highly respected academic men. The List of Sexual Harassers in Academia (""LoSHA"") was posted on October 24, 2017, by activist Inji Pennu and an Indian student in California named Raya Sarkar, who alleged they personally confirmed every incident.[335][336] This list has resulted in criticism against #MeToo because the allegations were unverified before they started spreading on social media. Some of the victims from the list have come forward to explain they were ignored, mistreated or retaliated against when they tried to pursue action.[337] Sarkar has defended The List, saying that she posted it only to warn her friends about professors and academics to avoid (mostly upper caste men), and had no idea it could become so popular.[336] A second list came out a week later that was made by women from a lower caste background and included more names, raising the total to around 70.[335]  Twelve prominent Indian feminists dismissed The List in a formal letter, saying they understand that the justice system is typically tilted against victims, but unverified claims make things harder for the feminist movement.[335][338] Writers Rhea Dangwal and Namrata Gupta responded that most victims from the list were poor students who tried to go through official channels without success or recourse, while every single man on the list has the ability to defend himself socially and legally.[335]  On September 27, 2018, former actress Tanushree Dutta accused Nana Patekar of sexual harassment,[339] which was the catalyst of the ""Me Too"" movement in India. The accusation by Dutta stirred a row of accusations from many women in industries including media and politics.[340][341][342] In October 2018, the Minister of state for External Affairs, MJ Akbar was accused of sexual harassment by several female colleagues through the 'Me Too' Movement in India.[343]  On October 21, 2018, former music director Anu Malik was suspended from the jury panel of Indian Idol 2018, after facing multiple allegations of sexual harassment made through the movement.[344]  Israel  In Israel, the Hebrew hashtag גםאנחנו# (#UsToo) began trending on October 18, 2017, with a front page spread in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.[265] Asi Levi said at the Ophir Award ceremony that unlike America, in Israel the status of those accused do not change.[345] A hashtag for men, #HowIWillChange, has also become popular.[346]  Palestine  #AnaKaman or وأنا كمان# (#MeToo) has also been used by Palestinian women from refugee camps.[347]  Italy  In Italy, women posted stories of assault and harassment under the hashtag #QuellaVoltaChe, which translates literally as ""TheTimeThat"".[348][349] The phrase was launched by the journalist Giulia Blasi.[350] Italian journalist Simona Siri wrote in The Washington Post that the initially popular movement quickly died out in Italy. She stated that Italian politician and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who is known for his role in wild parties (Bunga Bunga bacchanals) with underage women and prostitutes,[351][352] has contributed to a strong sexist culture with few female politicians in positions of power.[58] Movie directors Fausto Brizzi and Giuseppe Tornatore were accused of harassment by more than a dozen women but did not face any significant consequences or media scrutiny.[353][58]  The New York Times described the movement in Italy as ""Meh"" due to the lack of discussion. Laura Boldrini, the president of the lower house of Parliament, has declared that the movement cannot touch Italy because although there is much harassment, victims are often silenced and there's also a belief that ""in our country, there are no harassers"".[351] It has been reported that nearly 70% of female university students have been sexually harassed, and it is widely accepted that Italy is behind other countries when it comes to gender rights.[352] In response to #QuellaVoltaChe, one article from Libero was titled, ""First they put out, then they whine and pretend to regret it.""[352]  Italian Fabrizio Lombardo, an employee and friend of Harvey Weinstein, was widely covered by the media after he was accused of allegations that he aided Weinstein in sexually harassing Italian actress and former model Asia Argento, though he denies all wrongdoing.[354] Argento said of Italy, ""Nothing has changed"", and described her life after going public with the allegations as living a nightmare. She has made plans to leave Italy. Conservative TV news editor Alessandro Sallusti [it] criticized Argento for being an accomplice to Weinstein for not reporting him immediately, and several other public figures and politicians questioned her innocence.[351]  The Non Una di Meno group (Not One Woman Less), which is dedicated to stopping violence against women, wrote a letter in support of Argento and organised a protest in November 2017 where tens of thousands of people gathered in Rome.[352] Blogger Abbatto i muri (I Break Down Walls), journalist Ida Dominijanni, Cagne sciolte (literally, Loose Bitches), and author Michela Marzano also strongly supported Argento publicly.[352] Italian women's rights activist Lorella Zanardo has stated that it is taken for granted that women must give or sell their body in order to get high-profile positions in politics, film, and media.[351]  Maria Elena Boschi, a politician who has created governmental initiatives aimed at teaching women it's okay to say no to sexual advances, has been targeted in the news and on social media for her support of the #QuellaVoltaChe movement.[350] She has been impersonated in several fake interviews where the actresses portray Boschi in unflattering ways.[351] There are also photoshopped images of Boschi that have been shared widely on social media, including a doctored image with her underwear showing during her swearing-in ceremony, which never occurred.[351][355] Francesca Puglisi, the chair of the Commission of Inquiry into Femicide in Italy, said that one woman is killed every two days on average by male violence, and the problem is severely under-reported, though she credited the #QuellaVoltaChe hashtag and the work by Boschi with making a positive difference.[356]  Argento, herself, was accused of sexual misconduct in 2018 by actor Jimmy Bennett. Following this allegation, Argento was fired from her work on The X Factor Italy.[357]  Japan  In Japan approximately 4% of rapes are reported in Japan due to social stigmas against sexual assault survivors, of which half of the criminal charges are dropped by prosecutors.[41] Many rape myths in Japanese culture typically hold women accountable for sexual assaults instead of the assaulter, creating an environment where even if victims come forward ""Japanese society wants them to stay silent.""[41] Political Scientist Mari Miura argues that a lack of solidarity among women and the complicated, stigmatized and lengthy process of prosecuting rapists deters sexual assault survivors from speaking out.[358] In fact, the word ""rape"" is taboo in Japan, instead described with less threatening words like saying an underage victim was ""tricked,"" or a woman was ""violated"" thus contributing to a public lacking comprehensive understanding of the pervasiveness of the problem.[41] The legal age of consent in Japan is 13.[359] Women in Japan are regularly exposed to harassment from a young age,[360] for example, on public transportation[41] it is called chikan.[361] Prior to 2017, laws regarding the treatment of sexual assault had remained unchanged since 1907. It previously failed to consider oral and anal rape as assault. Despite the definition of assault being expanded in 2017, rape is criminalized and prosecutable under law only if there is clear evidence of physical force and resistance being involved in the act.[362]  Multiple other authors and public figures have criticized what they saw as Japan's silence on the topic of sexual assault, such as Kyoko Nakajima, Mayumi Mori,[41] Kirsten King,Akiko Kobayashi,[363][364] Hakuo Au (née Haruka Ito).[365] BuzzFeed Japan writer Takumi Harimaya has stated that by sharing these stories, other victims of sexual assault and harassment can know they are not alone.[365] Another journalist, Keiko Kojima stated that the movement is necessary to let people know that it is okay to say no to sexual violence, including male victims. She further remarked that despite how it is attacked in Japanese media, that #MeToo is not an ""anti-man"" campaign and that it is simply about anti-violence and anti-harassment. Kojima also believes it is extremely important for men to call out behaviors in others such as sexual harassment or having sex with someone who is unconscious and that every person who is not committing sexual violence is part of the #MeToo movement, whether they are male or female.[361]  As part of the #MeToo movement, Shiori Itō went public alleging that she was raped by Noriyuki Yamaguchi, a prominent TV journalist and acquaintance of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,[366] an admission she says was unthinkable for a woman to do in Japan. Yamaguchi rejects her accusations, and says that sex was consensual.[366] She said her experience with Japan's legal system showed her that victims of sex crimes were undermined and ignored. She called for the Japanese parliament to update Japan's laws regarding rape, which were over a century old. She explains how she could not get information on which hospital provides rape kits without going through a preliminary interview in person. When she went to the police, she was discouraged from filing a report, and informed her career would be ruined for no reason if she did this. She was told she did not act like a victim, and had to be interviewed by several officers, including one who made her reenact the rape with a dummy while he took pictures. Although they initially said they would arrest Yamaguchi, the case and charges were unexpectedly dropped. Itō then went to the media, but no one would take her story. When she spoke about the experience at a press conference, she made national news and immediately started receiving a negative backlash, hate mail, and threats.[41][367] She has been unsuccessful in her attempts to have criminal charges brought against Yamaguchi, but as of 2018 she was still pursuing a civil case against him, which he was defending.[366] After reflecting on her experience with reporting sexual assault, Itō notes that there ""is little concept of sexual consent in the law or in society"" which indicates a need for more education in schools especially given the prevalence of rape culture and power imbalances in Japanese society.[41] Itō further stated that the #MeToo Movement was small in Japan but that ""what’s happened in the United States and elsewhere has provided an opening in our media to discuss sexual harassment and assault here, and to raise awareness"".[41][368]  In 2018, Junichi Fukuda, a deputy finance minister in the Abe Administration, resigned after being accused of sexual harassment by his former subordinates and an anonymous TV Asahi reporter.[369][370] TV Asahi warned against their employee making this allegation and going public with the allegedly incriminating conversation between her and Fukuda. Fukuda was publicly defended by his boss, Finance Minister Aso Taro, who stated that Fukuda was unjustly reprimanded since sexual assault is not a punishable crime in Japan.[362] Aso Taro retained his job despite commenting that replacing female reporters with men should stop sexual harassment.[370]  A former member of the Japanese idol group Niji no Conquistador pressed charges against Pixiv representative director, Hiroaki Nagata, for sexual harassment during her time with the group, motivated by the #MeToo movement.[371] Nagata resigned following the lawsuit.[372]  As a result of the severe culture of victim blaming, the slogan #WeToo was developed in conjunction with #MeToo. The slogan was launched in order to spur more women to openly support the feminist agenda of revealing the prevalence of sexual harassment and showing solidarity with victims. By replacing ""Me"" with ""We"", the slogan allowed women to contribute to the movement without having to speak of their own experience with sexual harassment, which is associated with the risk of receiving stigma, shame, and ostracization. The slogan was developed by Monica Fukuhara, who had first hand experience in the difficulty women in Japan face in regards to the fear of speaking of their experience with sexual assault.[373]  Another manifestation of the MeToo movement in Japan was the following development of the KuToo campaign. Based on the Japanese word ""kutsu"" for shoes and the word for pain ""kutsuu"", the campaign was launched in response to the corporate norm that expects women at the workplace to always wear high heels. Similarly, women are pressured to wear high heels when job hunting, so as to raise the prospects of finding a competitive position in a corporation. Founded and supported by writer Yumi Ishikawa, the campaign gained enough support to result in a petition being sent to labour ministry officials. Specifically, KuToo aims to prompt officials to create anti-sexual harassment and discrimination laws that will prohibit companies from restricting women from wearing anything other than high heels at the workplace.[374]  Kenya  When #MeToo first went viral in October 2017, coverage was overshadowed in Kenya by a presidential election that was occurring the next week.[375] However, the #MeToo movement started slowly spreading in Kenya after the election was over.[375] In January 2018, it became especially popular after several new mothers alleged sexual misconduct at Kenyatta National Hospital, claiming that after giving birth they have been sexually assaulted when they went alone to breastfeed.[376] There were also allegations that children in the hospital have been sexually assaulted.[376] The hospital announced that the women were all lying, but in the future, women should stay together in groups in the hospital to prevent sexual assault. In response, hundreds of people protested in the streets of in Nairobi, Kenya, and an investigation was initiated by the health minister.[377]  Nepal  Former Mayor of Kathmandu, Keshav Sthapit has been accused of sexual harassment by two female office clerks of the Kathmandu Metropolitan Office, Rashmila Prajapati and Ujjwala Maharjan, as a part of the Me Too movement in Nepal.[378][379][380]  Nigeria  Culture  Nigerian women and children get sexually assaulted every day and do not speak up about it due to fear of stigmatisation and prejudice.[381] Official silence seems to surround sexual abuse of women in Nigeria, with the police frequently not taking sexual abuse reports seriously.[382] As a result, men, who are often the perpetrators of sexual abuse go unchallenged, and unpunished owing to factors such as culture and popular beliefs.[382] The custom of victim blaming is evident in testimonies rape and sexual abuse survivors.[381] Nigerian cultures look down on the open discussions of sexual matters and desires.[382] A great deal of the pressure to remain silent stems from socio-cultural values, customs and expectations about what constitutes socially accepted behaviours.[383] Cultural socialisation recognises men as having a naturally stronger sexual drive, and speaks of women in terms of shame, lack of interest in sexual matters and as one to be conquered by a domineering man.[382] Nigerians are socially nurtured and fed by oppressive patriarchal subjectivities that try to instil a sense of what is normal: sexually-speaking.[383]  Role of power and privilege  There is a factor of power influencing the slow growth of the movement in Nigeria. The country is a highly patriarchal society.[384] Women have complained of how unimaginable it is in the country to report cases of harassment.[385] Yet, sexual harassment is so prominent within the country that it is perceived as almost a right to men.[385]  Brenda Uphopho case  She had been assaulted three times by three different men. The first incident took place at age five. At that time, she was too young to understand what happened until a similar incident occurred at age 18. She was at a party when a stranger forced her to have sex with him. Upon her refusal, he beat her up and raped her. Due to the stigma attached to being raped, she resorted to silence. The final experience took place at her workplace when her boss forcibly put his hand under her skirt. She still remained silent with the notion of not being believed and being judged by others. Realizing she could not remain silent and needing to make an impact, Uphopho currently works with her husband to break the ""culture of silence"" around abuse in Nigeria. They produced a play called Shattered which seeks to encourage victims of sexual abuse to speak up.[386]  Norway  In Norway, under the hashtag #stilleforopptak (en. SilentforRecording), almost 600 actresses signed a petition and shared their stories through Aftenposten on November 16, 2017.[387] This also inspired dancers and musicians to create their own petitions, #nårdansenstopper (en. WhentheDanceStops) signed by 792 dancers,[388] and #nårmusikkenstilner (en. WhentheMusicQuiets) signed by over 1110 musicians.[389]  Trond Giske, the deputy leader of the Norwegian Labour Party and a former cabinet minister in Norway, resigned from his political positions on January 7, 2018, after being accused of an extensive pattern of sexual assault and sexual harassment of young women, and of taking advantage of his political positions to make unwanted sexual advances.[390] The accusations came in the context of the Me Too debate and dominated Norwegian media for several weeks from December 2017.[391] Accusations towards the now former leader of the Norwegian Young Conservatives, Kristian Tonning Riise, also saw the light of day. In a Facebook post, Tonning Riise wrote: ""I have been confronted with the fact that members of the Norwegian Young Conservatives on several occasions have reacted to my behaviour.""[392] It would later be revealed that the Conservative Party had received 15 alerts, whereas 10 of them regarded Tonning Riise.[393] Ulf Leirstein, Norwegian politician for the Progress Party and member of the Storting, had to take a break from office after it was discovered that he had shared pornographic images with a 14-year-old member of the Progress Party's Youth in addition to suggesting a threesome between him, a 30-year-old woman and a 15-year-old member of the Progress Party's Youth.[394]  Pakistan  Zainab rape-murder case  After the death of 7-year-old Zainab Ansari in January 2018, who was raped and killed, there began a wave of declarations on Pakistan social media in #MeToo style.[377] Sexual assault against a minor in Pakistan will result in 14 to 20 years in prison and a fine of 1 millions rupees.[395][396][397][398] Sheema Kermani, a classical dancer, has been called the leader of the Pakistan #MeToo movement.[399] Former model Frieha Altaf and designer Maheem Khan shared stories of sexual abuse, and challenged Pakistan to be more proactive at stopping children from getting raped.[377]  Film industry  Protests[400] marked the premieres of Teefa in Trouble in Karachi and Lahore by activists who boycotted the film over the sexual harassment allegations leveled against Ali Zafar by Meesha Shafi, as well as at least half a dozen other women, earlier in the year.[401] Zafar categorically denied the allegations and sued Shafi for defamation in the court where the case is ongoing.[402][403] On the other hand, Shafi had also filed a harassment case against Zafar, which, itself, is an ongoing investigation.[404]  With hashtags such as #BoycottAliZafar, #BoycottTeefainTrouble, and #TeefaisTrouble, a huge wave of activists built a momentum on social media ahead of the movie's premiere and subsequent screenings. A few major Pakistani media outlets outright ignored the demonstrations but other had to give in when protestors turned up at cinemas and police and other law enforcement agencies got involved.[405]  Zafar reportedly also had to avoid his grand arrival at the film's Karachi premiere and take a detour through the basement at Nueplex Cinemas in DHA, Karachi, in order to avoid the hoard of demonstrators who had gathered at the venue's main entrance.[406][407] During the protest, Feroze Khan, an actor and Zafar's friend, returned from inside the cinema in an attempt to sway the protestors by telling them to support ""Pakistani cinema""; however, he was turned away owing to his stance, to which he responded by making obscene gestures.[408][409]  Reports had also emerged that the Nueplex Cinemas’ security manhandled some of the demonstrators and verbally abused multiple people at the protest.[410]  Protestors again showed up at Lahore's CineStar for voice their anger and disappointment at both the promotion of the film of an alleged harasser and the celebrities pouring in to support him. The controversy deepened when, in one instance, the demonstrators asked Waleed Zaman, the creative director of women's clothing brand Kayseria, the reason why he was backing the film, to which Zaman responded by saying: ""We support sexual harassment of women.""[411][412]  Zaman later posted and deleted multiple apologies on his social media accounts.  At yet another screening of the film at Nueplex Cinemas at Rashid Minhas Road, Karachi, protestors were allegedly held in the basement and beaten by the cinema's private security, with various media reports confirming the incident.[413][414] The demonstrators’ phones were also confiscated and the cinema's security allegedly tried to plant incriminating evidence in one of the protestors' bags in order to make their case appear stronger to police.[403] However, they were let go later after the arrival of Rangers personnel.  Stand-up comedy  At least four women leveled allegations of sexual misconduct against Junaid Akram, a prominent stand-up comedian and vlogger.[415] Most of the accusers were girls in their teens and early twenties. Akram, too, denied ""all allegations of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct"", labeled them ""false"", and announced that he intended to pursue legal actions as he had ""already met my legal team"".[416]  Akram also clarified that his ""marital status is public information"".[417]  Charity sector  The son of world-renowned late philanthropist Abdul Sattar Edhi, Faisal Edhi, who now heads the Edhi Foundation, was also accused of sexual misconduct by a former journalist,[416][418] who said the man ""grabbed my hand tightly and tried to kind of pull me back into the van"". Faisal Edhi has denied the claims.[419]  Philippines  The Me Too movement has slowly picked up in the Philippines. In the culture of the Philippines, shaming and victim blaming are still present and is often encouraged.[420] They are afraid to say #MeToo because people do not believe them. Stories finally were heard from after actress Saab Magalona retweeted Alyssa Milano's infamous quote.[421] The accusations revolved around the entertainment industry as one of the bands, Jensen and The Flips was being brought up and they acknowledged their mistakes and apologized for their misconduct.[421] Statistics from the Philippine Commission on Women from 2004 to 2013 revealed that only 629 cases had been recorded with the Philippine national police's Women and Children Protection Center.[421] This figure is believed to only be a fraction of the actual number of harassment offenses committed against women. While the movement has not been as big as in the U.S., other movements such as #BabaeAko have started as a result of #MeToo. #BabaeAko translates to ""I am a Woman"" and began in May after President Rodrigo Duterte declared that the next Chief Justice of Philippines could not be a woman.[422]  South Korea  In South Korea, the Me Too movement started to gain momentum as public prosecutor Seo Ji-hyeon shared her experience of assault by a high-level prosecutor and oppression of government authorities on national television on January 29, 2018.[423] As part of her interview, Seo claimed that she was sexually assaulted by then Korean Ministry of Justice Policy Planning Director and former prosecutor Ahn Tae-geun at a funeral in 2010. She reported the activity to her supe",real
13664,"Winning $11.30 never looked so thrilling.  Lauren May, a brand manager at Clorox Company from San Francisco, jumped up and down, fell to her knees and screamed with excitement when she became one of several winners splitting the cash prize on HQ Trivia’s Jan. 1 game.  “Oh my god,” she screamed, as friends around her laughed. “I won $11!”  Her reaction went viral, eliciting a response from Scott Rogowsky, the most recognizable host of the trivia game. Rogowsky dubbed May the “HQtie” — a common pet name he uses for the trivia players — of the year.  Of course, that only made the news better for May. “I’m HQtie of the year,” she said, sobbing, in a separate video. “I love 2018 so much.”  MONEY has reached out to May for an interview.  Certainly winning $11.30 won’t change her life the way larger cash prizes could, but May’s reaction is relatable for other winners of the daily trivia game. Created by the founders of Vine, HQ Trivia is a daily game show on a smartphone app. Everyday at 9 p.m. and every weekday at 3 p.m., players have 10 seconds to respond to each multiple choice question. If they get all 12 questions, they win a portion of the jackpot.  Since launching late last year, the game has gained a significant following, with hundreds of thousands of people playing each round. The cash prizes vary, and everyone who wins a round splits the money.  In May’s case, her small cash prize likely came as a result of multiple winners and a low jackpot. For others, like Cesar Paolini of Miami, the prizes have been a bit bigger. He won $1,500 — the entire jackpot — in a December game after becoming the only winner of that round.  And on special occasions, HQ Trivia will make the jackpot upwards of $10,000.  As for May, winning HQ Trivia despite the small cash prize — and getting a Twitter shoutout from Rogowsky — was a successful start to a new year. “Good thing I’m not an emotional person or I’d be overwhelmed,” she tweeted.",real
3447,"From the looks of it, every tabloid other than Us Weekly seemed to be phoning it in this week, probably because they knew People Magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive would be the magazine women picked up at the grocery store. Thus, this week’s tabloid covers are going to be pretty boring – OK! Magazine is running a Twihard fan-fiction story, and now Star is phoning it in with a silly “Suri Cruise vs. Shiloh Jolie-Pitt” story. They released an excerpt, and I’m not really seeing how “the nannies” are telling us anything we don’t already know, except for the whole idea of Suri playing with diamonds. Can you imagine giving a little girl a diamond to play with?  At just four years old, both Suri Cruise and Shiloh Jolie-Pitt are already living like Hollywood royalty. But for the little princess and the rough and tumble tomboy, life couldn’t be more different! One plays with diamonds, the other, with dead animals. And who would know better about their polar opposite lives than the people who care for them? In the Nov. 29 issue of Star, on sale now, insiders from the Cruise and Brangie camps reveal the most intimate and shocking secrets of Suri and Shiloh’s totally different lives. Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes’ daughter Suri “never hears the word ‘no,’ from a nanny or anyone else,” a source explains. Whether it’s a priceless diamond tiara or cupcakes at midnight, spoiled Suri’s wish is her overworked staff’s command! But taking care of tomboy Shiloh, the daughter of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, presents a different set of challenges. Though she’s a sweet girl with a heart of gold, Shiloh has a serious mischievous streak that often gets the better of her. As we report in this week’s issue, the wild child collects dead animals, plays childish pranks on unsuspecting nannies and cuts the heads of sister Zahara’s dolls! “She was playing cowboys and Indians once and she said she had to scalp them,” an insider reveals. “Brad made her apologize.”  [From Star Magazine]  Shiloh learned about scalping from Brad! She watched Inglorious Basterds and she screamed “I learned it from watching you, DAD!” Also: Shiloh cuts the heads off Empress Z’s dolls?!? The Empress is not pleased with this. The Empress shall bide her royal time and then Her Serene Highness shall order Minion Knox to do something absolutely horrible to Shiloh’s beloved, dead, stuffed pet bird.",fake

1919,"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)  Judd Apatow has spoken out against Quentin Tarantino for not confronting Harvey Weinstein about his alleged mistreatment of women.  “Knew enough since Clinton was President and MC Hammer was selling millions of records. That’s a lot of years to not confront a friend,” Apatow wrote on Twitter on Thursday night.  In an interview with the New York Times on Thursday, Tarantino admitted that he knew of Weinstein’s alleged mistreatment of women years ago but did not do enough to stop it.  In the interview, the director, who worked with Weinstein on basically all his major film projects, said that he’d known about Weinstein’s action as far back as the ’90s but didn’t do anything to stop it, something he admits to regretting.  “I knew enough to do more than I did,” Tarantino told the paper. “There was more to it than just the normal rumors, the normal gossip. It wasn’t secondhand. I knew he did a couple of these things.”  Tarantino owned up to hearing directly from his ex-girlfriend Mira Sirvino and another unnamed actres about their experiences with Weinstein. He also was aware that Rose McGowan, who last week tweeted that Weinstein had raped her, had allegedly reached a legal settlement with him. Despite this, he did not realize that the incidents were part of a larger pattern.  “What I did was marginalize the incidents,” he said. “Anything I say now will sound like a crappy excuse.”  Instead, Tarantino continued to work with Weinstein in the years since, including on Oscar-nominated films “Inglorious Basterds” and “Django Unchained.”  A rep for Apatow declined a request for comment, while Tarantino’s did not respond.",fake

Bruno Mars has proven time and again it's his prerogative to do what he wants to do — especially when it comes to reigniting the charts with the sounds of '90s funk and R&B.  His ""Finesse"" remix, featuring Cardi B, is another guaranteed hit from his 2017 album 24K. Mars lifts a page straight out of New Jack Swing producer Teddy Riley's sonic playbook and recasts the '90s aesthetic stylized by such New Jack Swing-affiliated artists as Bobby Brown and Heavy D for the video. Hev, of course, penned and performed the classic theme song to the Keenan Ivory Wayans sketch comedy series In Living Color, which serves as inspiration for the look and theme of the video — all the way down to show's resident dance crew, The Fly Girls.

805,"Hollywood’s headstrong “Pretty Woman” is racing headlong toward an ugly $225 million divorce! Julia Roberts’ recent romantic reconnection with on-screen love Richard Gere enraged her hubby, Danny Moder — and sparked a vicious face-off that may end up in court, insiders exclusively claim to RadarOnline.com.  “Julia and Danny have had their flare-ups over the years, but nothing like this fight,” a source spilled. “Danny was furious about Richard, and dumped out all his frustrations about their troubled marriage in one ferocious rant!”  A storm brewed amid reports Roberts, 49, and Gere, 68, reignited their flirtatious friendship when they reunited on the Today show in 2015 to mark the 25th anniversary of their blockbuster ’80s rom-com, Pretty Woman.  The pair engaged in very public on-camera PDA, and Radar learned the two — who also sizzled in 1999’s Runaway Bride — continued to hook up in a series of under-the-radar romantic rendezvous.  “They’ve met numerous times for discreet dinner dates,” a source spilled. “They’ll book a private room, where they’ll be left uninterrupted and can even stay past closing hours.”  When Moder, 48, discovered Julia’s blatant betrayal, he hit the roof, according to insiders. “He suspected that Julia was secretly meeting Richard, but reading about it in the media was humiliating to him,” the source snitched.  According to insiders, Moder tore Roberts apart during an expletive-laden explosion. “Julia was shocked by how ferociously Danny went after her,” a source spilled. “He ripped her for everything from her trysts with Richard to treating him like her houseboy.”  The fiery showdown was just the latest battle between the troubled pair during their 15-year marriage, which has weathered a series of problems.  Last year, Radar revealed claims that the couple was living virtually separate lives after nasty fights over their three children — 12-year-old twins Hazel and Phinnaeus, and Henry, 10 — with Danny banished to a small ranch house across the street from Julia’s spectacular Malibu mansion.  “They had an epic fight — over the kids,” a spy dished. “The kids had been going to Our Lady of Malibu, a Catholic school not far from their home. “But Danny insisted Julia send them to another school in Calabasas. That really hurt Julia because she loved Our Lady of Malibu and what it meant to her family.”  The Oscar winner has also been romantically linked to a string of co-stars — both before and after marrying Moder!  Just last year she was caught on camera crying over her marital woes in the arms of Owen Wilson on the Vancouver set of their upcoming film, Wonder. “They spent a lot of time together off the set,” a spy snitched. “They were constantly flirting. It was like they were a couple.”  PHOTOS :Julia Roberts Breaks Down Crying On Set Amid Rumors Of Marriage Trouble  Meanwhile, Roberts wasn’t the only one caught cuddling up to someone else!  Nine months after cinematographer Moder wed Roberts in 2002, he was reportedly seeing his ex-wife, Vera Steimberg! Insiders told Radar Vera cruelly called to taunt Julia, saying, “He’s come back to me.”  In another slap in the face to Roberts, Moder was notoriously caught surfing off the shores of Malibu on the day her beloved mother, Betty Lou Bredemus, passed away in 2015. And Danny didn’t even bother showing up for Betty Lou’s memorial service!  “It’s been a rough few years, and Julia didn’t need to look any further for support than Richard,” another source revealed.  “She is captivated by Richard. He’s intelligent, worldly, compassionate and sensitive,” said the source, adding those qualities are exactly what Roberts wants now.  The silver-haired fox is also single — having divorced actress Carey Lowell in 2016 — and insiders reported the affection between the big-screen lovebirds is mutual!  Moder could have a strong case in divorce court, according to another insider. “Danny may have signed a prenup,” said the source, “but if he can make a case that he made career sacrifices for her and that she cheated with Richard, his support payments would go through the roof!”  We pay for juicy info!

Both have said they still love each other over the past year, and Garfield during award season was especially verbose in his praise of Stone's work.  ""I'll speak for myself: You know, I'm her biggest fan as an artist,"" he told Vanity Fair in January. ""I'm constantly inspired by her work. I'm constantly inspired by how she handles and holds herself. So for me, I've—it's been bliss to be able to watch her success and watch her bloom into the actress that she is.

Stone and her biggest fan boy may be able to see each other a little more easily in the coming months.

The reality star, whose real name is Matthew Sanderson, is begging Botched surgeons Dr. Paul Nassif and Dr. Terry Dubrow to fix his abs because he constantly has to wear a corset or girdle to 'smooth everything out' on his stomach.  In a preview clip for Wednesday night's episode of the E! reality series, Matthew, 33, explains that he fell in love with drag after seeing his first show as a teenager and his newfound passion led to him getting extensive cosmetic surgery.

'To be so young and to be accepted into that world at such an early age, it was like a high for me.'  'Then I started meeting all these other people who had these beautiful bodies and these gorgeous faces and they looked like aliens,' he explains, 'and I was like I want that.'  Matthew says he met a man who was able to give him 'some alterations here and there, so I jumped on the opportunity and I jumped on the needle.'  'If I had to put a number on the amount of silicone I have in my body, probably gallons,' he estimates.  Famous face: Matthew (pictured in April 2017) was a runner up on season two of RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars, as well as a season five alum  Keeping it real: Matthew estimates that he has 'gallons' of silicone in his body  Passion: He says fell in love with drag after seeing his first show as a teenager  The world-famous drag queen says he started by getting injections in his face, cheeks, lips, and a 'little bit' in his chin.  'I swelled up so much, but I was obsessed,' he recounts. 'My lips were like huge and I could see them bouncing when I would walk around.'  Matthew was so thrilled by the changes he made to his face, he eventually started getting injections in his body.

'The one thing that I regret the most doing is my six pack,' he admits. 'They're not perfectly parallel; they look very uneven.'  Although Matthew shies away from saying he is famous, he notes he is 'gaymous' and confesses to worrying about what the 'world' is going to think of his stomach.  'They are all very critical; they all have a very strong opinion,' he says of the public. 'I was like, well, I don't want to have to sit and read nasty comments all the time about how gross my abs are.'  Sculpting the perfect body: Matthew went on to get injections in his pecs (pictured)  Toned arms: Matthew has had injections in his biceps and shoulders  Sculpted: Matthews says he has even had injections in his hips and buttocks  The fear of public scrutiny makes Matthew feel like he always has to be 'covered up.'

At the end of the clip, Matthew begs the doctors to fix his six pack once and for all.

But, don't get the Biebs wrong, Selena Gomez is the girl he really wants to be with.

It wasn’t his choice for them to split, and he is really taking time to focus on himself right now. He has been working out every day, focusing on church and being out and about with his friends.”  The source then tried to minimize Champion's place in Bieber's heart. Maybe a little damage control if Gomez is reading from Sydney: “Justin was introduced to Baskin through his friend group and they have only hung out a few times.

The Rehab Addict star, 41, has been hit with new allegations from Shane Maguire, the father of her son Harper, claiming she is “not a fit” mother and has allegedly been intentionally sabotaging the relationship between the boy and his dad, according to legal documents obtained by The Blast.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Maguire’s filing states that the HGTV and DIY Network personality “played games” with the times and locations at which they were supposed to exchange Harper, of whom they currently have joint custody, noting that coparenting has “proven to be a nightmare” and “things have deteriorated between [the parents] to the detriment of Harper.”  Image zoom Nicole Curtis/Instagram  It also claims that the home renovation TV star has been “doing all she can to prevent any sort of set schedule that would allow Harper to be with both of his parents without interference,” including an alleged episode that “turned into a game of cat and mouse” on Father’s Day when Maguire says he had to drive to several different locations over two-and-a-half hours to try and track down Curtis and take custody of Harper.  Maguire put in an official request on July 3 to give him sole custody of Harper, claiming Curtis is “not a fit and proper person to share legal or physical custody” because “she is either unable or unwilling to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing parent-child relationship between Harper and [Maguire].”  Curtis did not immediately reply to PEOPLE’s request for comment.  WATCH THIS: HGTV’s Nicole Curtis on Almost Injuring LeBron & Being Called a ‘Bad Ass’ by Lenny Kravitz  She is due to appear in court later this month to defend previous alleged violations of her and Maguire’s co-parenting agreement.  While the couple’s legal battle has lasted years, Maguire most recently filed a legal complaint that claimed she relocated to California from Michigan in an attempt to keep him from seeing his son, but dropped it after the pair settled the misunderstanding.  The pair briefly seemed to make peace, having a dinner “just the two of us” during which they discussed their son’s wellbeing, but the situation soon crumbled as Curtis posted on Instagram that she was refused time with Harper on Easter.  “We both love our children more than anything, and we’re really no different than anyone else trying to navigate through some really trying times and the challenges of being the best mom and dad possible,” she told PEOPLE in March.

3184,"It could not be further removed from the grandeur of St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.  While Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are planning their wedding – expected to attract a global TV audience of one billion – The Mail on Sunday can today reveal the extraordinary New Age nuptials of Meghan's parents Tom and Doria.  The pair married on December 23, 1979 at the wacky Self-Realisation Fellowship Temple on gaudy Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.  The faux-Indian temple adorned with gold orb-topped turrets, stone elephants and plastic Buddhas is a stone's throw from where Hugh Grant was infamously caught with prostitute Divine Brown.  Meghan Markle's parents Tom and Doria (pictured) married on December 23, 1979 at the wacky Self-Realisation Fellowship Temple on gaudy Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles  'A fresh new day… and it is ours,' read the opening line of their wedding invitation, with the promise of 'happy beginnings when we, Doria Loyce Ragland and Thomas Wayne Markle unite our love as one'.  'It was a lovely wedding but not conventional at all,' said Meghan's uncle Joseph Johnson, 68, last night as he opened up Meghan's family photo album for the first time.  'Doria was very young, just 23, but looked much younger. She had tiny white flowers in her hair.  'We were happy that she was happy. It's almost unbelievable to think our Meghan, our Flower, is about to marry into the Royal Family.'  While much has been written about Tom, 73, a retired award-winning Hollywood lighting director, and Doria, 61, a yoga instructor who Meghan calls 'her inspiration', very little has been known about the maternal side of the family who, Joseph says, 'truly' raised Prince Harry's future bride.  Both Doria and her mother Jeanette got divorced while their children were young, and while Meghan's father Tom remained in her life, his 'crazy' work hours meant the burden of raising her fell to the women in the family.  The faux-Indian temple adorned with gold orb-topped turrets, stone elephants and plastic Buddhas where they got married (pictured) is a stone's throw from where Hugh Grant was infamously caught with prostitute Divine Brown  'Meghan was raised by her mother and grandmother, two beautiful, strong black women who instilled in her a sense of self-belief.  'These days a lot of women flaunt their sexuality. Meghan is an exception to that rule. She's not someone who uses their looks to get ahead.  'She is beautiful on the outside but she was raised to believe it's what's on the inside that counts.'  Today, The Mail on Sunday can reveal Meghan's maternal grandmother was Jeanette Ragland, who was raised in poverty in Cleveland, Ohio, the daughter of a hotel bellhop and a mother who made her living as a lift operator ('she pressed the buttons') at a 'fancy whites-only hotel'.  It was Jeanette and Doria who helped the future Suits actress 'believe she could be anything and achieve anything', her uncle claims.  And we can reveal that the family suffered 'appalling' racism – once being hounded out of a Texan town at night in the middle of a snowstorm – a painful history which, her uncle says 'helped shape Meghan into the strong, powerful, independent woman' she is today.  'It was a lovely wedding but not conventional at all,' said Meghan's uncle Joseph Johnson (pictured), 68, last night as he opened up Meghan's family photo album for the first time. He is pictured with his wife of 37 years Pamela  Joseph, a softly spoken retired sign painter, met me at a modest hotel near the bungalow he shares with his wife of 37 years Pamela, a social worker.  The couple have three adult sons. He calls himself 'a simple man' and says he feels 'awkward' his family has been thrust into the limelight: 'We're just regular folks.'  They live in Fresno, California, a four-hour drive but a world away from the bright lights of Hollywood where Meghan was raised in middle class comfort in the suburb of Woodland Hills in a home Tom, an Emmy-award winning lighting director, bought shortly before Meghan was born in 1981.  After Tom and Doria divorced when Meghan was six, they remained amicable but it was a 'backbone' of strong matriarchs which, Joseph says, turned Meghan into the woman she is today.  'Culturally our family did not have male figures around,' Joseph says.  'The women were the ones left to raise the children. And Meghan was lucky my sister and mother were tough, fair, funny and smart.'  Future royal Meghan Markle is pictured with her mother Doria Ragland  Doria's grandmother Netty (Meghan's great-grandmother) was married three times.  She worked as a lift operator at the fancy St Regis in Cleveland, a whites-only hotel where she fell in love with James Arnold, a bellboy, who abandoned her soon after the birth of their daughter.  Jeanette, born at the start of the Great Depression in 1929, married Joseph's father, Joseph Snr, when she was in her early 20s.  Joseph Jnr was born in 1949 and his sister Saundra arrived three years later.  Jeanette struggled to support her two children as a single mother: 'My father was a professional roller skater who toured the country.  He left and went off to start another family. We moved 20 times in a few years. We were never starving but we were poor.'  When Joseph was six his mother, a Catholic, met charismatic antiques dealer Alvin Ragland, a former Baptist minister.  The pair immediately fell in love and moved into a basement flat in a three-storey building in Cleveland.  'Alvin didn't know how to be a father,' Joseph says sadly.  Meghan's mother Doria Ragland was born in September 1956 and, within months, Alvin uprooted the young family and drove across country to LA.  They were so poor they did not have their own car. Instead, says Joseph, they drove one belonging to someone else: 'Back then people would pay to have someone drive their car from the East to the West Coast.'  It was a grand adventure which came to a grinding halt amid shocking bigotry in Texas.  'We arrived in a small town in the middle of the night in a blizzard. We were cold and hungry but no one would give us a room.  'We wanted food and shelter but we were turned away because of the colour of our skin.  'It was the first time I'd experienced racism. I was young but I remember one guy pointing off into the snow saying, 'The highway is that way. Get going. You are not welcome here.'  Though Joseph and Saundra are technically the half-siblings of Doria, they consider themselves 'united, equally loved'.  Meghan's mother Doria is pictured in her 1972 school yearbook from Fairfax High in LA  Doria's father Alvin divorced Jeanette shortly after they arrived in LA. He later worked as an antiques dealer running a store called 'Twas New and worked Sundays at a stall at a flea market.  'We were raised together. There was an age difference with Doria, she was the youngest, but, like Meghan, she's whip-smart and always wanted more out of life,' says Joseph.  Alvin would later die of a head injury after tripping over his dog's leash.  While Joseph and his sister went to a school in a predominantly black area of LA, Doria went to Fairfax High, a mostly white, Jewish school which, under US laws of desegregation, began bussing in black pupils from the poorer parts of city in the early 1970s.  Doria prided herself on her hair – 'a big beautiful Afro'.  After school she worked as a travel agent ('she did that to get reduced-price trips') and as a clothing designer, making her own creations for her company A Change of A Dress.  She also ran an import business for a while, bringing in incense from the Far East.  She then worked as a trainee make-up artist on TV show General Hospital, which brought her into the orbit of Tom Markle, a man 12 years her senior.  He was a divorcee with two children but the couple fell in love and married within six months of meeting in 1979.  'None of the family knew anything about Tom until we got the wedding invitations,' says Joseph.  'The fact that he was white didn't matter. We would have accepted pink, black, brown or red as long as Doria loved him. All that mattered to us was he treated her well.'  The wedding was a wacky affair. At 6ft 3in, bearded and balding Tom, then aged 35 and dressed in a grey jacket and red shirt, towered above his 5ft 2in bride.  Meghan embarked on her first royal visit with fiance Prince Harry (pictured) in Nottingham  'She wore a simple white dress. My son was the ring-bearer,' Joseph recalls.  Guests walked through a faux-Moorish entrance to the temple. Presiding over the nuptials was 'Brother Bhaktananda' in glowing orange robes.  Born Michael Krull in Pennsylvania, he was ordained a Buddhist priest and took the Sanskrit name Bhaktananda, meaning 'bliss through devotion.'  The Self-Realisation Fellowship, founded by Indian yogi Paramahansa Yogananda, preaches 'spirituality and self-knowledge through meditation and Kriya yoga'.  Joseph says his sister 'was fascinated by alternative religions and yoga', an interest Joseph claims she passed on to Meghan although she will now be baptised into the Church of England before marrying Harry next May.  'Meghan is someone open to all cultures and religions,' he says.  When Meghan was born, Joseph says his sister was 'instantly smitten'. 'I saw her look at that baby and it was total love and devotion.  That same love and devotion exists to this day.' Doria never remarried or had any other children after splitting from Tom.  Jeanette helped raise Meghan when Doria returned to work after the birth, first as a yoga teacher and then as a social worker.  A smiling Meghan and Harry are pictured at an event for World AIDs Day in Nottingham on Friday  Doria later went to university as a mature student and obtained a degree in social work.  'Meghan was raised by Doria and my grandmother,' Joseph says. 'We would spend weekends, holidays together. She's always been magical.  'She was raised in love, never beaten. When I moved to Fresno and Meghan became a teenager we spent less time together.  'I saw how Doria was raising Meghan and it helped me with my own boys.  'Our mother was a disciplinarian and she spanked us. Doria never spanked Meghan.'  He recalls Meghan as a friendly, inquisitive child who loved cats and 'radiated happiness'. 'Her mum called her Flower and that was the family name for her.'  The last time Joseph spent any time with Meghan was when Jeanette was dying in 2000: 'She lived with us. Meghan and her mum would come up at weekends to give us a break.  'Meghan would talk to her, hold her hand, do whatever she could for her grandmother. She was very loving. When I look at Meghan now I see my mother very clearly, and my sister,' he adds.  He last spoke to Doria a year ago when she called after the news of Meghan's romance with Harry broke: 'She was just real proud.'  Of his niece making a 'fairy tale' match he says: 'She was raised to believe in herself and she is someone who has grown up moving between two cultures.  'She was raised in our loving family. She was loved by her black family and her white family and learned that love crosses all boundaries.'",fake

Set in the early 1950s at an amusement park on Coney Island, the film takes its title from the park's Ferris wheel. The story follows the second wife and the estranged daughter of a carousel operator as they both pursue affairs with a lifeguard.[4]  The film served as the closing night selection at the 55th New York Film Festival on October 14, 2017,[5] and was released on December 1, 2017 by Amazon Studios.[6] The film received mixed reviews, but with praise for Winslet's performance and the cinematography.  Plot [ edit ]  Mickey Rubin, a Coney Island lifeguard who aspires to be a playwright like Eugene O'Neill, narrates through the fourth wall. Carolina, the daughter of Humpty Rannell, arrives at the boardwalk looking for Ginny Rannell, her father's second wife who works as a waitress at the clam shack. She begs Ginny to let her live with them, but Ginny leaves it up to Humpty, who angrily kicked her out when she married her mobster boyfriend Frank and threw away her college education and chance for a better life. Carolina tells him she is on the run from Frank, who she believes wants to kill her because she gave evidence of mob activity to the FBI. Humpty lets her stay on the condition that she save money to return to college and better her life. Ginny gets her a waitressing job where she works. Soon, Mobsters Angelo and Nick come around, asking Humpty and Ginny for Carolina, but they deny having seen her and the mobsters leave.  Ginny used to be an actress and was happily married, but her infidelity caused her husband to divorce her. She and Humpty are raising her young son Ritchie, a troubled boy who habitually gets into trouble by setting fires. She is unhappy with Humpty and life on the boardwalk, and begins carrying on an affair with Mickey. Humpty is an angry and loud recovering alcoholic who runs the carousel and goes fishing with his friends to bring home dinner. He finds joy and patience for life with Carolina around, and he pays for her to attend night school.  Mickey is attracted to Ginny's maturity and experience, and views her as a damsel in need of saving. He and Carolina accidentally meet some time later, and he becomes attracted by Carolina's story. He thinks he is in love with her, but is conflicted about his feelings for Ginny. Ginny steals money from Humpty to buy Mickey an expensive watch as a birthday present, which he refuses to accept. By this time, Ginny has become suspicious of Mickey's feelings for Carolina and is jealous.  Mobsters Angelo and Nick come around again, asking the owner of the clam shack about Carolina's whereabouts. Carolina takes Mickey on a date to a Brooklyn pizza parlor, and her boss innocently tells this to Angelo and Nick. Ginny telephones the pizza parlor to warn Carolina but begins to stammer, realizing her opportunity to take Carolina away from Mickey, and hangs up. Mickey tells Carolina the truth about his feelings for her and his affair. Instantly feeling compassion for everyone involved, Carolina walks home alone to process the information and decide what to do, not wanting to hurt Ginny or her father or Mickey. We see Angelo and Nick's car following her as she leaves the pizza parlor.  When Carolina does not come home, Humpty asks Mickey the next day if he saw her after the date. Mickey investigates and learns Ginny called the pizza parlor but did not speak. Piecing it together, he confronts Ginny, who has started drinking and getting made up in one of her glamorous stage costumes. She pulls a knife out of the drawer and asks Mickey to kill her, but he leaves. Humpty comes back, sinking back into alcoholism after the police find no trace of Carolina, and tells Ginny he needs her help again to function in life. He tries to find a positive outlook and invites her to meet his friends' wives on a fishing trip, but she coldly refuses, keeping their life in its rut.  Cast [ edit ]  Production [ edit ]  Casting [ edit ]  Kate Winslet was the first actor who came on board for the film, in July 2016,[7][8] followed by Juno Temple and Jim Belushi.[9] Describing the casting process, Allen said, ""The first person I cast was Kate Winslet, then I cast a young girl named Juno Temple who I thought very much of,"" and ""I cast Jim Belushi who I thought was absolutely perfect for it.""[10] Talking about the film, Winslet – who was previously attached to Allen's 2005 drama film Match Point but left the project to spend more time with her family – said, ""I play the lead. My character is called Ginny, and she's a waitress in a clam house ... It was probably like the second most stressful part I've ever played, but the experience itself was just utterly incredible.""[11]  Allen later signed Justin Timberlake in the role of a lifeguard,[12][13] saying that ""I was doing this film and I thought, who could I get that would be an interesting guy to play a lifeguard in about 1950? I was sitting and talking with my brain trust. Someone said, 'What about Justin Timberlake?'""[10] On August 19, 2016, Tony Sirico joined the cast.[14] In September 2016, Jack Gore, Steve Schirripa, and Max Casella rounded out the cast of the film.[15][16][17]  Filming [ edit ]  Principal photography began in Coney Island on September 15, 2016.[18] On the same day, filming took place at Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn around Hudson Avenue and Gold Street.[19]  Release [ edit ]  The film premiered as the closing film of the New York Film Festival on October 14, 2017. It was theatrically released on December 1, 2017, on Allen's 82nd birthday.[6]  Reception [ edit ]  Box office [ edit ]  Wonder Wheel grossed $1.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $14.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $15.9 million.[3]  In the United States the film made $125,570 from five theaters in its opening weekend (an average of $25,114), marking a 61% drop from Café Society's debut the previous year.[20]  In France, the film was released on January 31, 2018 and sold 20,147 tickets on its opening day, marking the lowest of any Allen film in over 15 years.[21]  Critical response [ edit ]  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 31% based on 188 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Wonder Wheel gathers a charming cast in an inviting period setting, but they aren't enough to consistently breathe life into a Woody Allen project that never quite comes together.""[22] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".[23]  Graham Fuller for Screen International wrote a positive review, praising Allen, ""It would be going too far to say Wonder Wheel is an instant Woody Allen classic, but it’s a reminder that he’s still a force to be reckoned with.""[24]  Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave Wonder Wheel three out of four stars, and lauded Winslet's performance, writing ""there are valid criticisms of Wonder Wheel as a film that feels more like a stage play – its claustrophobic atmosphere can be stifling. But even covering familiar ground, Allen finds the blunt truth at its core. As Ginny is stripped of her fantasies and exposed to the harsh glare of reality, Winslet stands her ground, as if to say attention must be paid. It should be. Her performance is absolutely astounding.""[25]  Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Chris Nash found the film to be relatively weak, giving it a C- rating and stating, ""Coney Island has never looked more gorgeously golden-hued (thanks to cinematographer Vittorio Storaro), but Allen has seldom been less sharp.""[26]  Accolades [ edit ]",fake

She has won three Golden Globe Awards, from eight nominations, and has been nominated for four Academy Awards for her film acting, winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Erin Brockovich (2000).  Her films have collectively brought box office receipts of over US$2.8 billion, making her one of the most bankable actresses in Hollywood.[2] Her most successful films include Mystic Pizza (1988), Steel Magnolias (1989), Pretty Woman (1990), Sleeping with the Enemy (1991), The Pelican Brief (1993), My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), Notting Hill (1999), Runaway Bride (1999), Erin Brockovich (2000), Ocean's Eleven (2001), Ocean's Twelve (2004), Charlie Wilson's War (2007), Valentine's Day (2010), Eat Pray Love (2010), Money Monster (2016), and Wonder (2017). Roberts was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for her performance in the HBO television film The Normal Heart (2014). In 2018, she starred in the Prime Video psychological thriller series Homecoming.  Roberts was the highest-paid actress in the world throughout most of the 1990s[3][4] and in the first half of the 2000s.[5] Her fee for 1990's Pretty Woman was US$300,000;[6] in 2003, she was paid an unprecedented $25 million for her role in Mona Lisa Smile (2003). As of 2017 , Roberts's net worth was estimated to be $170 million.[7] People magazine has named her the most beautiful woman in the world a record five times.[8]  Early life and family  Roberts was born on October 28, 1967, in Smyrna, Georgia,[1][9] to Betty Lou Bredemus (1934–2015) and Walter Grady Roberts (1933–1977).[1][9][10] She is of English, Scottish, Irish, Welsh, German, and Swedish descent.[11][12] Her father was a Baptist, her mother a Catholic,[13] and she was raised Catholic.[14][15] Her older brother Eric Roberts (b. 1956), from whom she was estranged for several years until 2004, older sister Lisa Roberts Gillan (b. 1965), and niece Emma Roberts, are also actors. She also had a younger half-sister named Nancy Motes (1976–2014).  Roberts' parents, one-time actors and playwrights, met while performing in theatrical productions for the armed forces. They later co-founded the Atlanta Actors and Writers Workshop in Atlanta, off Juniper Street in Midtown. They ran a children's acting school in Decatur, Georgia, while they were expecting Julia. The children of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King attended the school; Walter Roberts served as acting coach for their daughter, Yolanda Denise King.[16] As a thank-you for his service, Mrs. King paid Mrs. Roberts's hospital bill when Julia was born.[17]  Her parents married in 1955. Her mother filed for divorce in 1971; the divorce was finalized in early 1972.[18] From 1972, Roberts lived in Smyrna, Georgia, where she attended Fitzhugh Lee Elementary School, Griffin Middle School, and Campbell High School.[19] In 1972, her mother married Michael Motes, who was abusive and often unemployed; Roberts despised him.[20] The couple had Nancy, who died at 37 on February 9, 2014, of an apparent drug overdose.[21] The marriage ended in 1983, with Betty Lou divorcing Motes on cruelty grounds; she had stated that marrying him was the biggest mistake of her life.[20] Roberts's own father died of cancer when she was ten.[22]  Roberts wanted to be a veterinarian as a child.[23] She also played the clarinet in her school band.[24][25] After graduating from Smyrna's Campbell High School, she attended Georgia State University but did not graduate. She later headed to New York City to pursue a career in acting. Once there, she signed with the Click Modeling Agency and enrolled in acting classes.[26][27]  Acting career  1980s  Roberts made her first big screen appearance in the film Satisfaction (1988), alongside Liam Neeson and Justine Bateman, as a band member looking for a summer gig. She had previously performed a small role opposite her brother Eric, in Blood Red (she has two words of dialogue), filmed in 1987, although it was not released until 1989. Her first television appearance was as a juvenile rape victim in the initial season of the series Crime Story with Dennis Farina, in the episode titled ""The Survivor"", broadcast on February 13, 1987. Her first critical success with moviegoers was her performance in the independent film Mystic Pizza in 1988;[28] that same year, she had a role in the fourth-season finale of Miami Vice. In 1989, she was featured in Steel Magnolias, as a young bride with diabetes, and received both her first Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actress) and first Golden Globe Award win (Motion Picture Best Supporting Actress) for her performance.[28]  1990s  Roberts became known to worldwide audiences when she starred with Richard Gere in the Cinderella–Pygmalionesque story, Pretty Woman, in 1990, playing an assertive freelance hooker with a heart of gold.[28] Roberts won the role after Michelle Pfeiffer, Molly Ringwald, Meg Ryan, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Karen Allen, and Daryl Hannah (her co-star in Steel Magnolias) turned it down.[29] The role also earned her a second Oscar nomination, this time as Best Actress, and second Golden Globe Award win, as Motion Picture Best Actress (Musical or Comedy).[28] Pretty Woman saw the highest number of ticket sales in the U.S. ever for a romantic comedy,[30] and made US$463.4 million worldwide.[31]  Roberts starred as one of five students conducting clandestine experiments that produce near-death experiences in the supernatural thriller Flatliners, in 1990. Her next film was the commercially successful thriller Sleeping with the Enemy (1991), in which she took on the role of a battered wife who escapes her abusive husband, played by Patrick Bergin, and begins a new life in Iowa. Roberts played Tinkerbell in Steven Spielberg's Hook, and starred as a nurse in Joel Schumacher's romance film Dying Young; both films were also released in 1991, to a highly positive commercial response.[32][33]  Roberts took a two-year hiatus from the screen, during which she made no films other than a cameo appearance in Robert Altman's The Player (1992). In early 1993, she was the subject of a People magazine cover story asking, ""What Happened to Julia Roberts?"".[34] Roberts starred with Denzel Washington in the thriller The Pelican Brief (1993), based on John Grisham's 1992 novel of the same name.[28] In it, she played a young law student who uncovers a conspiracy, putting herself and others in danger. The film was a commercial success, grossing US$195.2 million worldwide.[35][36] None of her next film releases – I Love Trouble (1994), Prêt-à-Porter (1994) and Something to Talk About (1995) – were particularly well-received by critics.[37][38][39] In 1996, she guest-starred in the second season of Friends (episode 13, ""The One After the Superbowl""),[40] and appeared with Liam Neeson in the historical drama Michael Collins,[28] portraying Kitty Kiernan, the fiancée of the assassinated Irish revolutionary leader. Stephen Frears' Mary Reilly, her other 1996 film, was a critical and commercial failure.[41][42]  By the late 1990s, Roberts enjoyed renewed success in the romantic comedy genre. In My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), she starred opposite Dermot Mulroney, Cameron Diaz and Rupert Everett, as a food critic who realizes she's in love with her best friend and tries to win him back after he decides to marry someone else. The film was a global box-office hit[43] and is considered to be one of the best romantic comedy films of all time.[44][45] In 1998, Roberts appeared on Sesame Street opposite the character Elmo, and starred in the drama Stepmom, alongside Susan Sarandon,[46] revolving around the complicated relationship between a terminally-ill mother and the future stepmother of her children. While reviews were mixed,[46] the film made US$159.7 million worldwide.[47]  Roberts paired with Hugh Grant for Notting Hill (1999), portraying a famous actress falling in love with a struggling book store owner. The film displaced Four Weddings and a Funeral as the biggest British hit in the history of cinema, with earnings equalling US$363 million worldwide.[48] An exemplary of modern romantic comedies in mainstream culture, the film was also received well by critics. CNN reviewer Paul Clinton called Roberts ""the queen of the romantic comedy [whose] reign continues"", and remarked: ""Notting Hill stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds.""[49] She reunited with Richard Gere and Garry Marshall, both of Pretty Woman, to play a woman who has left a string of fiancés at the altar in Runaway Bride, also released in 1999. Runaway Bride received generally mixed reviews from critics,[50][51][52][53] but it did very well at the box office, grossing US$309.4 million around the globe.[54] Roberts was a guest star on the episode ""Empire"", of the television series Law & Order, with regular cast member Benjamin Bratt (at that time her boyfriend). She earned a nomination for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.[55]  2000s  In 2000, Roberts portrayed real-life environmental activist Erin Brockovich in her fight against the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) of California in the film Erin Brockovich, for which she received US$20 million;[56] Rolling Stone magazine's Peter Travers wrote, ""Roberts shows the emotional toll on Erin as she tries to stay responsible to her children and to a job that has provided her with a first taste of self-esteem"",[57] while Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman felt that it was a ""delight to watch Roberts, with her flirtatious sparkle and undertow of melancholy"".[58] Erin Brockovich made US$256.3 million worldwide,[59] and Roberts won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role. In December 2000, Roberts, who had been the highest-paid actress through the 1990s, became the first actress to make The Hollywood Reporter's list of the 50 most influential women in show business since the list had begun in 1992.[3]  Roberts' first film following Erin Brockovich was the road gangster comedy, The Mexican (2001), giving her a chance to work with long-time friend Brad Pitt. The film's script was originally intended to be filmed as an independent production without major motion picture stars, but Roberts and Pitt, who had for some time been looking for a project they could do together, learned about it and decided to sign on. Though advertised as a typical romantic comedy star vehicle, the film does not focus solely on the Pitt/Roberts relationship and the two shared relatively little screen time together. The Mexican earned $66.8 million at the U.S. box office.[60]  Her next film, the romantic comedy America's Sweethearts (also 2001), starred Roberts along with Billy Crystal, John Cusack, and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Joe Roth, the Hollywood farce centers on a supercouple, Gwen and Eddie, who separate when she dumps him for another man. Roberts portrayed Gwen's once-overweight sister and assistant who has been secretly in love with Eddie (Cusack) for years. Reviews of the film were generally unfavorable: critics' felt that despite its famous cast, the movie lacked ""sympathetic characters"" and was ""only funny in spurts.""[61] A commercial success, it grossed over US$138 million worldwide, however.[62]  In fall 2001, Roberts teamed with Erin Brockovich director Steven Soderbergh for Ocean's Eleven, a comedy-crime caper film and remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film of the same name, featuring an ensemble cast including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon. Roberts played Tess Ocean, the ex-wife of leader Danny Ocean (Clooney), originally played by Angie Dickinson, who is dating a casino owner played by Andy García. A success with critics and at the box office alike, Ocean's Eleven became the fifth highest-grossing film of the year with a total of US$450 million worldwide.[63]  In 2003, Roberts was cast in Mike Newell's drama film Mona Lisa Smile, also starring Kirsten Dunst, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Julia Stiles. Roberts received a record US$25 million for her portrayal of a forward-thinking art history professor at Wellesley College in 1953 – the highest ever earned by an actress until then.[64] The film garnered largely lukewarm reviews by critics, who found it ""predictable and safe"".[65]  Eat Pray Love, September 2010 Roberts in Paris promoting, September 2010  In 2004, Roberts replaced Cate Blanchett in Mike Nichols's Closer, a romantic drama film written by Patrick Marber, based on his award-winning 1997 play of the same name.[66] The film also starred Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen.[66] Also in 2004, she reprised the role of Tess Ocean in the sequel Ocean's Twelve. The film was deliberately much more unconventional than the first, epitomized by a sequence in which Roberts' character impersonates the real-life Julia Roberts, due to what the film's characters believe is their strong resemblance.[67] Though less well reviewed than Eleven, the film became another major success at the box office, with a gross of US$363 million worldwide, mostly from its international run.[68] Unlike all the male cast members, Roberts did not appear in the series' third and final installment, Ocean's Thirteen (2007), due to script issues.[69] In 2005, she was featured in the music video for the single ""Dreamgirl"" by the Dave Matthews Band; it was her first music video appearance.[70] Roberts appeared in The Hollywood Reporter's list of the 10 highest-paid actresses every year from 2002 (when the magazine began compiling its list) to 2005.[5]  Besides providing her voice for roles in the 2006 animated films The Ant Bully and Charlotte's Web,[71][72] Roberts made her Broadway debut on April 19, 2006, as Nan in a revival of Richard Greenberg's 1997 play Three Days of Rain opposite Bradley Cooper and Paul Rudd. Although the play grossed nearly US$1 million in ticket sales during its first week[73] and was a commercial success throughout its limited run, her performance drew criticism. Ben Brantley of The New York Times described Roberts as being fraught with ""self-consciousness (especially in the first act) [and] only glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays.""[74] Brantley also criticized the overall production, writing that ""it's almost impossible to discern its artistic virtues from this wooden and splintered interpretation, directed by Joe Mantello.""[74] Writing in the New York Post, Clive Barnes declared, ""Hated the play. To be sadly honest, even hated her. At least I liked the rain—even if three days of it can seem an eternity.""[75]  Her next film was Charlie Wilson's War, with Tom Hanks and Philip Seymour Hoffman, directed by Mike Nichols; Roberts played socialite Joanne Herring, the love interest of Democratic Texas Congressman Charles Wilson. It was released on December 21, 2007,[76] to critical acclaim,[77] with Roberts eventually earning her sixth Golden Globe nomination.[78] Fireflies in the Garden, an independent drama in which Roberts played a mother whose death sets the story in motion, also starred Ryan Reynolds and Willem Dafoe; the film was screened at the 2008 Berlin International Film Festival and was subsequently shown in European cinemas—it did not get a North American release until 2011.[79] In 2009, Roberts starred with Clive Owen in the moderately successful comic thriller Duplicity, playing a CIA agent collaborating with another spy to carry out a complicated con.[80] For her performance, she received her seventh Golden Globe nomination. Also in 2009, Lancôme announced that Roberts would become their global ambassador for their company.[81]  2010s  In 2010, Roberts played an U.S. Army captain on a one-day leave, as part of a large ensemble cast, in the romantic comedy Valentine's Day, and starred as an author finding herself following a divorce in the film adaptation of Eat Pray Love. While she received US$3 million up front against 3 percent of the gross for her six-minute role in Valentine's Day,[82] Eat Pray Love had the highest debut at the box office for Roberts in a top-billed role since America's Sweethearts.[83][84] Later in the year, she signed a five-year extension with Lancôme for US$50 million.[85]  In 2011, she appeared as a college teacher and the love interest of a middle-aged man returning to education in the romantic comedy Larry Crowne, opposite Tom Hanks, who directed and played the title role.[86] The movie received generally mediocre reviews with only 35% of the 175 Rotten Tomatoes reviews giving it high ratings,[87] although Roberts's comedic performance was praised.[88] In Mirror Mirror (2012), the Tarsem Singh adaptation of Snow White, Roberts portrayed Queen Clementianna, Snow White's evil stepmother, opposite Lily Collins.[89]  In 2013, Roberts starred alongside Meryl Streep and Ewan McGregor in the black comedy drama August: Osage County, about a dysfunctional family that re-unites into the familial house when their patriarch suddenly disappears.[90] Her performance earned her nominations for the Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Critics' Choice Award, and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, amongst other accolades.[91][92][93][94] It was her fourth Academy Award nomination.[95]  In 2014, Roberts starred as Dr. Emma Brookner, a character based on Dr. Linda Laubenstein,[96][97] in the television adaptation of Larry Kramer's AIDS-era play, The Normal Heart, which aired on HBO; the film was critically acclaimed and Vanity Fair, in its review, wrote: ""Roberts, meanwhile, hums with righteous, Erin Brokovich-ian anger. Between this and August: Osage County, she's carving out a nice new niche for herself, playing brittle women who show their love and concern through explosive temper"".[98] Her role garnered her a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie.[99] She also narrated ""Women in Hollywood"", an episode of the second season of Makers: Women Who Make America, in 2014.[100] In 2015, Roberts appeared in Givenchy's spring–summer campaign,[101][102] and starred as a grieving mother opposite Nicole Kidman and Chiwetel Ejiofor in the little-seen film Secret in Their Eyes, a remake of the 2009 Argentine film of the same name, both based on the novel La pregunta de sus ojos by author Eduardo Sacheri.[103]  In 2016, she reunited with Garry Marshall again to appear as an accomplished author who gave her child for adoption in the romantic comedy Mother's Day, opposite Jennifer Aniston, Kate Hudson, Jason Sudeikis, and Timothy Olyphant. The film received ""overwhelmingly negative reviews"", but budgeted at US$25 million, was a moderate box office success, grossing US$48.5 million.[104] She also starred as a television director in the thriller Money Monster, directed by Jodie Foster and alongside George Clooney and Jack O'Connell.[105][106][107]  In Wonder (2017), the film adaptation of the 2012 novel of the same name by R. J. Palacio, Roberts played the mother of a boy with Treacher Collins syndrome.[108] The Times felt Roberts ""lifts every one of her scenes in Wonder to near-sublime places"",[109] as part of a positive reception,[110] and with a worldwide gross of US$305.9 million, Wonder emerged as one of Roberts' most widely seen films.[111][111] Roberts took on the role of a caseworker at a secret government facility in her first television series, Homecoming, which premiered on November 2, 2018 on Amazon Video.[112]  Film production  Roberts runs the production company Red Om Films (Red Om is ""Moder"" spelled backwards, after her husband's last name[113]) with her sister, Lisa Roberts Gillan, and Marisa Yeres Gill.[114] Through Red Om, Roberts served as an executive producer of the first four films of the American Girl film series (based on the American Girl line of dolls), released between 2004 and 2008.[115]  Personal life  Roberts in 2002  Relationships and marriages  Roberts had romantic relationships with actors Jason Patric, Liam Neeson, Kiefer Sutherland, Dylan McDermott, and Matthew Perry.[116][117] She was briefly engaged to Sutherland; they broke up three days before their scheduled wedding on June 11, 1991.[118] On June 25, 1993, she married country singer Lyle Lovett; the wedding took place at St. James Lutheran Church in Marion, Indiana.[119] They separated in March 1995 and subsequently divorced.[120] From 1998 to 2001, Roberts dated actor Benjamin Bratt.[121]  Roberts and her husband, cameraman Daniel Moder, met on the set of her film The Mexican in 2000 while she was still dating Bratt. At the time, Moder was married to Vera Steimberg. He filed for divorce a little over a year later, and after it was finalized, he and Roberts wed on July 4, 2002,[122] at her ranch in Taos, New Mexico.[123] Together, they have three children: twins, a daughter and a son, born in November 2004,[124] and another son born in June 2007.[125]  Religious beliefs  In 2010, Roberts said she was Hindu.[126] Roberts is a devotee of the guru Neem Karoli Baba (Maharaj-ji), a picture of whom drew Roberts to Hinduism.[127]  In September 2009, Swami Daram Dev of Ashram Hari Mandir in Pataudi, where Roberts was shooting Eat Pray Love, gave her children new names after Hindu gods: Laxmi for Hazel, Ganesh for Phinnaeus and Krishna Balram for Henry.[128]  Philanthropy  Roberts has given her time and resources to UNICEF as well as to other charitable organizations. On May 10, 1995, Roberts arrived in Port-au-Prince, as she said, ""to educate myself.""[129][130] The poverty she found was overwhelming. ""My heart is just bursting,"" she said.[129] UNICEF officials hoped that her six-day visit would trigger an outburst of giving: US$10 million in aid was sought at the time.[129][130]  In 2000, Roberts narrated Silent Angels, a documentary about Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder.[131] The documentary was designed to help raise public awareness about the disease. In July 2006, Roberts became a spokeswoman for Earth Biofuels, as well as chair of the company's newly formed Advisory Board promoting the use of renewable fuels.[132] She supported Gucci's ""Chime For Change"" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment.[133]  Roberts was the voice of Mother Nature in a 2014 short film for Conservation International, intended to raise awareness about climate change.[134]  Awards and nominations  Filmography  References",fake

And according to our insider, dating is the last thing on her mind! Take a look back at the adorable former couple right here!  “Anna and Chris’ decision to separate was a long-time coming, it wasn’t a rash decision,” a source close to Anna tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “They tried to make it work for a long time, but it just wasn’t doable. They grew apart, and Chris changed a lot as his career became more and more successful; they just found themselves in completely different places and in the end they fell out of love. It’s highly unlikely they will ever get back together again. It was a tough decision to break up, and it took a lot of soul-searching on both sides. But it really was for the best, for them and for their son [Jack Pratt, 5].” Absolutely gut-wrenching.  Our insider went on to add that the Scary Movie star is focusing on taking care of herself and being a good mother during this difficult period. “They really want to keep things as amicable as possible, and hope that once the drama of the divorce is over, they will be able to maybe forge some kind of friendship, but as far as romance is involved, that’s really not in the cards. Right now, Anna has no desire to start dating, she’s totally focused on her son and on healing her heart. She would like to stay single for at least a year so she can regroup and get her head together. Meeting somebody else is really not on the agenda for her, she just needs some ‘me time’ right now.” Totally understandable considering the jarring circumstances.

3185,"UPDATE: Following reports that Chrissy Teigen opened up—and joked about—plastic surgery, she's taken to Twitter to clarify a few things. (1) Yes, she has undergone a procedure before. (2) Obviously, not everywhere.  To be fair, I totally would.  This story was originally posted on May 5, 2017 at 4:00 P.M.  Chrissy Teigen, my personal hero and yours, is many things—a voice for all the unrealistic B.S. expected of women, especially new moms, a fantastic cook, a queller of Twitter trolls—but one thing she isn't is fake. At least in the sense of telling things like they are, whether that's about stretch marks, postpartum depression, or plastic surgery. And that's why her latest admission making headlines falls in the category of ""stuff Chrissy keeps it real about.""  At an event for her new Becca highlighter palette, the model told a room full of writers that people always ask her about her cheeks and whether or not they're real, Byrdie reports. Guess what? They're all hers. But she followed up with this: ""Everything about me is fake except my cheeks,"" she said, laughing and pointing to her forehead, nose, and lips. ""Fake, fake, fake.""  With her usual refreshing candor, Teigen went on to explain why she's happy with her decision to get treatments done—a friendly reminder that celebrities are humans with insecurities too. ""I had my armpit sucked out,"" she said, noting that the liposuction procedure wasn't exactly necessary but that it made her feel better. ""It added two inches of length to my arms. [That fat] is coming back though, so I might need to go in and pay for it again."" To put it in better context, she said that last line while laughing.  While no celebrity is ever obligated to discuss something so intimate as fillers or facial surgery, it's great that Teigen's choosing to do so. Just like how you wear your hair or your taste in how sparkly highlighter should be, plastic surgery is a purely personal choice—and it's one that shouldn't be criticized. If we're to celebrate women having autonomy over their own body and health, this is a taboo (and recurring tabloid speculation staple) that's got to go.  Plastic surgery stigma: 0. Chrissy Teigen: too many to count.

4055,"Though there's been no shortage of false alarms and rumors along the way, in reality, we haven't actually seen Kylie Jenner in the flesh—or, at least as captured in the lens of a TMZ camera—since September of 2017. That dry spell has finally lifted on this holy day of Thursday, January 25, in which TMZ published a photo and video of Jenner out in the wild. Seeing as she was followed by a pack that included her mom, Kris Jenner, and her best friend, Jordyn Woods, this really seems to be Kylie this time—not just another random, perhaps Photoshopped 20-year-old spotted in CVS.  Jenner's return to the public eye was not nearly as glamorous as you would expect: The crew was in fact spotted on a rough, dirt-covered terrain, inside a construction site in Hidden Hills, aka the Los Angeles enclave that's also home to Drake's YOLO Estate. Jenner could have been planning out future mansions for herself and her long rumored baby, but the locale was definitely an abrupt departure from Jenner's more recent appearance, a Calvin Klein campaign revealed earlier this week that saw Jenner posing alongside her family members—and obscuring herself with some strategically placed blankets. (As for her sighting on Wednesday, her baggy, somewhat bulky sweater definitely has served as confirmation of a significant bump for some.)

Calvin Klein  What seems like an endless number of sources have offered details about the pregnancy, and if the rumors are to be believed, Jenner is due to give birth this month, having kept her pregnancy a secret because she's lived a life in the public eye—something she'll reportedly return to when she switches gears and becomes a mommy blogger.  Still, countless questions remain: Did Jenner, with the help of her mastermind momager, wear a baggy sweater just in case she was spotted to add fuel to the fire, or have we finally gotten that long-awaited confirmation? With her cosmetics company already set to be worth $1 billion by 2022, has she been spending her months closeted indoors planning a multimillion-dollar blogging haven for her new family with Travis Scott?

1425,"For those wondering how much Taylor Swift is still enjoying keeping her love life almost completely private, People has an update. Apparently t's still awesome being semi-secretly with British boyfriend of over a year, Joe Alwyn. “She seems to be in a great place both career and love wise,” a source told the outlet. Alwyn tries to attend her concert dates when he can, the source added. Footage of him there hasn't really been shared on social media, except for at the first show—a testament to how undercover these two can keep things.  Alwyn is really the best though, the source made abundantly clear: “Joe is just an amazing boyfriend. He is very supportive. Taylor adores his family. She’s in a very good place.”  Swift and Alwyn were last photographed out together on a North London pub date at the end of May. And that outing was rare itself: Swift has only been photographed out with Alwyn a couple times and has never spoken about him besides in her songs.  Last August, a source told People that this whole keeping the relationship out of the press thing really works for her. ""Her decision to keep her relationship with Joe quiet is making her happy,"" the source said then. ""They have been getting to know each other slowly without any pressure.”  In People's new report today, its source also mentioned that Swift “has a few days off for July 4th” but gave no indication whether she'd throw the usual Taymerica party for her celeb friends at her Rhode Island estate.

19093,"A spokesperson for the Clark County District Attorney's Office tells PEOPLE that the case was ""denied due to insufficient evidence""  Jen Harley won’t face domestic charges for an incident in which it was alleged she briefly dragged her ex Ronnie Ortiz-Magro with her car while their infant daughter was in the backseat.  A spokesperson for the Clark County District Attorney’s Office tells PEOPLE that the case was “denied due to insufficient evidence.” TMZ was the first to report the news.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The Jersey Shore star welcomed his first child, daughter Ariana Sky, with Harley on April 3. In the months that followed, the exes have been making headlines for their explosive altercations.  On June 24, Harley, 31, was charged with domestic battery after the car-dragging incident. She was released from the Clark County Detention Center the following day after posting the $3,000 bail.  Image zoom Jen Harley LVMPD/Splash News  A spokesperson for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department told PEOPLE that a suspicious vehicle call came in at about 10:22 p.m. A patrol unit was dispatched to the intersection and determined that a male and a female were in a struggle over a vehicle. Callers reported that the male was bleeding and the car had two flat tires.  Officers made contact with Ortiz-Magro, 32. They also made contact with Harley, who was standing by with another citizen. Officers determined that Ortiz-Magro had gotten out of the vehicle and Harley had driven away as he was holding onto the vehicle, dragging him briefly, according to the spokesperson. She was determined to be primary aggressor and arrested on one count of misdemeanor domestic battery.  Ortiz-Magro had apparent minor injuries to the mouth and arm as well as road rash. He was not transported to the hospital.  According to the spokesperson, “the child was picked up by a family friend before officers arrived on the scene.”  Ortiz-Magro was not filming Jersey Shore Family Vacation when the incident occurred and MTV had no comment when reached by PEOPLE. A rep for Ortiz-Magro also had no comment; Harley was unable to be reached.  Image zoom Jen Harley and Ronnie Ortiz-Magro Jen Harley/Instagram  A source told PEOPLE that Ortiz-Magro and his ex were at a barbecue with friends earlier that day, where they got into a “verbal fight.” On the drive home, “the fight escalated” and Harley “was pummeling his face,” said the source.  “He was screaming for her to stop the car as she was driving,” said the source. “She hit the median and got a flat tire which caused her to slow down. He begged to get out and opened the door but she continued to pull away while he was getting out and it tore up his entire arm. It’s a mess from road rash and from being dragged along the street as he was caught in the belt.”  The source also confirmed that a mutual friend stepped in to take care of the exes’ infant daughter, noting that “everybody is so fearful for this baby.”  According to the source, Ortiz-Magro had been “trying his best” to make things work with Harley for the sake of their daughter.  “If the kid wasn’t involved, it would be over,” said the source. “He’s constantly trying to make it work for the sake of his daughter. But we’re hopeful this is the final straw and he doesn’t put himself and his daughter back in danger.”  On Tuesday, Ortiz-Magro flew from Las Vegas to New Jersey with his daughter to resume filming season 2 of Jersey Shore Family Vacation.

19092,"The stars of Netflix's hit Queer Eye reboot are defending Pete Davidson's whirlwind romance with Ariana Grande.  The Fab Five -- Tan France, Karamo Brown, Bobby Berk, Jonathan Van Ness and Antoni Porowski -- sat down with Andy Cohen on Sunday's Watch What Happens Live! where they were asked, by a viewer calling in, how they felt about the couple's surprising recent engagement.  As it turns out, they are all really supportive, despite some people's trepidation that the lovebirds are moving too quickly.  ""I'm very, very happy for them, I couldn't be more happy,"" France said. ""I think if anybody finds like that's amazing.""  When asked about the fact that Davidson and Grande had only been dating for a month when he popped the question, France said that, for some people, it just works out -- like for him and his husband, Rob.  ""I told my husband five days into it that I would marry him, he said the same,"" France said. ""And we're together 10 years later, so who knows?""  For Brown, the engagement was exciting news, and he was hoping to get some inside info, but his plans didn't work out.  ""We all know them, and they're sweet, and I texted him immediately and was like, 'Hey! Did you get engaged? Oh my gosh, congratulations! I wanna send a gift!' But I was really being nosey and he didn't text me back,"" Brown said, disappointed.  Ultimately, it was Porowski who's quiet, sage wisdom summed up their defense of Davidson and Grande's engagement the best: ""Sometimes, you just know.""  Back in March, France took Davidson on a shopping adventure through New York City to help him step up his style game, in a short video shared by Saturday Night Live. However, it seems their friendship has stayed strong.  ""I just went shopping with him a couple days ago,"" France said, although he didn't reveal whether or not he'd be helping him shop for wedding clothes whenever that day comes.

2732,"Watching your parents go through a divorce is never easy, but when your parents are uber-famous actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and every detail is under media scrutiny, it can take the situation to a whole new level. It has been over a year since Jolie and Pitt announced their split after a 12-year relationship that included two years of marriage, but the divorce proceedings continue to drag on without resolution. Is it possible that the breakup is causing some severe sibling rivalry between oldest sons Maddox and Pax Jolie-Pitt?  In the latest issue of National Enquirer, the tabloid is claiming that 16-year-old Maddox and 13-year-old Pax are locked in a feud, causing non-stop fighting between the two brothers. The source in the story says that Maddox is bossy and Pax has had enough; and with the younger brother being taller and stronger, Maddox could “have that smug smile knocked off his face.” However, Gossip Cop has looked into the story and has discovered that it is inaccurate.  Teenage boys do have disagreements, but that doesn’t mean there is any battle between the brothers. According to Gossip Cop’s source, Maddox and Pax are close, and they get along just fine. The divorce has been difficult for the family, but they are all getting through it as best they can.

4410,"(JTA) — Most artists would see playing one concert at New York’s Madison Square Garden as a crowning achievement. Billy Joel has now done it 100 times.  Before and after his landmark show last week at the “World’s Most Famous Arena,” the native Long Islander gave a series of interviews about his legacy. In one with CBS News, he was asked about the most memorable moments during his incredible — and likely all-time record-breaking — MSG run.  After mentioning the nights that involved his daughter Della onstage, Joel brought up the concert during which he wore a yellow Star of David. Joel pinned the star to his jacket during the encore of a Garden show last August, shortly after white supremacists and neo-Nazis led a deadly march in Charlottesville, Virginia.  “This past year or so, there was the night I wore the Star of David, after the Charlottesville incident,” he said.  Although Joel is usually described as atheist or secular, his father was a German-born Jew who recalled the rise of Hitler and lost relatives in the Holocaust. CBS interviewer Anthony Mason pointed out that Joel usually avoids taking political stands.  On the weekend of the rally, President Donald Trump said “both sides” were to blame for the violence that occurred — and that were some “very fine people” among the far-right marchers as well as their opponents. That struck a dark chord with the songwriter.  “I had to do something that night,” Joel responded. “The president said [after the Charlottesville rally], you know, ‘There’s some good people on that side …’ No, Nazis aren’t good people.  “It really enraged me, actually,” he continued. “My old man, his family got wiped out. They were slaughtered in Auschwitz. Him and his parents were able to get out. But then he was in the U.S. Army during the war and fought with Patton and was shot at by Nazis. … My family suffered. And I think I actually have a right to do that.”  While many found the act courageous, it prompted some criticism.  But the singer also started a trend. Soon after, TV star Nev Schulman and musician and producer Jack Antonoff (both outwardly Jewish) both wore Jewish stars at the MTV Video Music Awards — Schulman wore one pinned to his suit jacket, and Antonoff wore one in necklace form. Lena Dunham, Antonoff’s girlfriend at the time, said he ordered the necklace after feeling like Nazis had become a “mainstream thing again.”  RELATED:  Billy Joel wore a yellow Jewish star. Thanks, but the trend should stop there.",fake
5905,"ABC has renewed “Modern Family” for two more seasons of 22 episodes each, TheWrap has learned.  The hit family comedy has officially been renewed through Season 10, which will air in the 2018-19 season. The order will bring the series to a staggering total of 232 episodes.  The news comes after months of negotiations between the network, producers 20th Century Fox Television and the cast, whose previous deals expired at the end of Season 8, though a renewal was likely always in the cards given the show’s success in the ratings.  Also Read: 'Scandal' to End After Season 7  “Modern Family has been the centerpiece of our comedy brand for eight seasons and we are thrilled to have it on our schedule for two more years. Steve and Chris have created such endearing characters, and the cast is second-to-none,” said ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey in a statement.  “We are beyond thrilled that we get to spend more time with these characters, these amazing actors, our ridiculously-talented writers and our incredible crew – all of whom are like family to us. And the good kind of family, not the kind that argues with you all the time,” added co-creator and executive producer Steve Levitan.

2177,"Alex Rodriguez flatly denied a report that claimed he was threatening to cut child-support payments for his two daughters over a legal dispute with his ex-wife’s brother.  “I have always paid far more than the maximum in child support and that will never change,” the former New York Yankees star said in a statement to Page Six.  “It’s highly offensive to me that my former brother-in-law, who has been trying to pursue a frivolous case against me for four years and has gotten absolutely nowhere with it in court, is misrepresenting my relationship with my daughters to manipulate the public’s opinion,” he added.  The report Wednesday in the New York Daily News came soon after it was learned that A-Rod had just purchased a $15 million Manhattan apartment with girlfriend Jennifer Lopez.  According to the Daily News report, Rodriguez told his ex-wife Cynthia that he would cut his support payments for daughters Natasha, 13, and Ella, 9, over a legal dispute with her brother, Constantine Scurtis.  A-Rod’s alleged threat was meant to send a message to Scurtis, the Daily News added.  Cynthia had texted her brother, explaining: “I’m just trying to defend my child support situation … and it’s terrible.”  She continued, “I have an email from (Rodriguez) telling me that he’s basically making me pay for not stopping you and telling you that I hate you.”  The tension Cynthia is referring to is a four-year legal battle between Rodriguez and her brother.  Scurtis sued his ex brother-in-law in 2014, claiming he was pushed out of the real estate company they founded together when his sister’s marriage began to fail, the Daily News said. The lawsuit accuses Rodriguez of mortgage and insurance fraud, among other things.  “He’s totally out of control,” Cynthia said in another text, “but I share 2 kids with him so I try to keep e (sic) everything good for them.”  “I hope it all ends soon. It’s revolting,” Cynthia added.  Rodriguez and Cynthia divorced in 2008 after six years of marriage. The Daily News pointed out that Rodriguez definitely isn’t hurting for cash. He was paid $21 million by the Yankees in 2016 — the final year of his 10-year, $275 million contract — without having to play. He currently has a gig as part of ESPN’s “Sunday Night Baseball” team.  It’s unclear how much money Rodriguez is required to pay each month for child support, the Daily News said.  He and Lopez started dating in February 2017, and the two have been high-profile about their coupledom. They sometimes post photos of their newly blended family which consists of his kids and hers; she has 10-year-old twins Max and Emme with her ex-husband Marc Anthony.  Rodriguez expressed disgust at the way his former brother-in-law was using his daughters in an effort to turn the media against him for his own gain. Related Articles Ah, Bennifer!

11753,"Pitch Perfect 2 is a 2015 American musical comedy film directed and produced by Elizabeth Banks and written by Kay Cannon. It is a sequel to the 2012 film Pitch Perfect and the second installment in the Pitch Perfect film series. The film centers on the fictional Barden University Bellas, an all-female a cappella singing group, who try to beat out a competing German musical group in a world singing championship. The film features an ensemble cast, including Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Hailee Steinfeld, Brittany Snow, Hana Mae Lee, Alexis Knapp, Ester Dean, Chrissie Fit, Kelley Jakle, Shelley Regner, Katey Sagal, and Keegan-Michael Key as well as Skylar Astin, Ben Platt, Adam DeVine, Anna Camp, John Michael Higgins, and Banks all reprising their roles.  It was released in the United States on May 15, 2015 by Universal Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed over $287 million worldwide. It surpassed the total gross of the original film ($115.4 million) in five days, and also became the highest-grossing music comedy film of all-time, overtaking School of Rock ($131.3 million).[5] A sequel, Pitch Perfect 3, was released on December 22, 2017.[6][7]  Plot [ edit ]  Three years after winning the previous competition, the Barden Bellas are now led by senior Beca Mitchell and three-time super senior Chloe Beale. The Bellas have become ICCA champions each of these three years. However, the group gets involved in a national scandal (dubbed ""Muffgate"") when Patricia ""Fat Amy"" Hobart accidentally rips her pants in front of U.S. President Barack Obama during a performance on his birthday at the Kennedy Center, showing her genitalia to the public as she did not wear her underwear. This scandal leads to the Bellas' suspension from the ICCAs. Beca makes a deal to allow the Bellas to be reinstated, should they win the World Championship of Acappella.  Freshman Emily Junk begins her college career, hoping to follow in the footsteps of her mother, Katherine, by being a Bella. Katherine tells Emily she is more than junk and that she is in fact Pitch Perfect. At orientation, she watches an Acappella performance by the Treblemakers, now led by Beca's boyfriend Jesse Swanson. Benjamin ""Benji"" Applebaum, Jesse's best friend, overhears Emily, leading to a crush on her.  The Bellas learn that Das Sound Machine (DSM), a German powerhouse group, has replaced the Bellas on their victory tour. Additionally, Beca has started an internship at a recording studio, Residual Heat, something only Jesse knows.  Emily goes to the Bellas' sorority house to audition for them because of their absence from the auditions. When she sings her unfinished song ""Flashlight,"" she succeeds in joining the Bellas.  At a car show where the ICCA winners are due to perform, the Bellas scout their replacements, DSM, led by intimidating duo Pieter Krämer and Kommissar, who take delight in mocking the all-girl group. Later, the Bellas are invited to an exclusive riff-off against DSM. Also in attendance are the Treblemakers and the Tone Hangers (a group of former Treblemakers, including former Treblemakers leader Bumper Allen, whom Amy is now dating), as well as a group calling themselves the Green Bay Packers. The Bellas make it to the final two, but end up losing to DSM in the final showdown after nervous Emily sings ""Flashlight,"" which is an original song and is not from the right category (""90's Hip-Hop Jamz"").  The next day at the warmups, the Bellas' chances of winning end in disaster when the performance sets Cynthia Rose's hair on fire by pyrotechnics. Even before then, John and Gail question the Bellas' identity. As the Bellas' stage has grown bigger, the scale of their performance grew bigger as well. Their choreography (designed by Chloe) became more complex and difficult, and they added probs and acrobatics (done by Flo) to their performance too. In order to regain harmony and sync of their voice, Chloe takes them to a retreat led by former leader Aubrey Posen. Beca starts a heated debate with Chloe over herself being the only one thinking about life beyond the Bellas and Chloe's obsession with winning Worlds.  To prove to her boss that she can produce music well, Beca offers Emily to produce ""Flashlight"" at the studio. The group realizes that they will no longer be together and may go their separate ways after graduation, and regain harmony by singing ""Cups (When I'm Gone)"" (the very song that got Beca into the Bellas in the first movie). Amy confesses that she broke up with Bumper, and the next day, she goes to apologize to Bumper by standing on a canoe and paddling across the lake to him while singing ""We Belong."" Hurt, Bumper initially tries to turn Amy away, but as the song progresses, he forgives her, and they reconcile. At the studio, Emily and Beca present their song to Beca's boss, in which he demonstrates envy for their talent and looks forward to producing with them.  The senior Bellas graduate and they all head off to Copenhagen for the World Finals, with Jesse and Benji to cheer them on. They perform a harmonized version of ""Flashlight"" with Aubrey, Katherine, and other past Bellas joining in. The Bellas win the championship and repair their damaged legacy. As the senior Bellas leave Barden, they give Emily a belated proper initiation with Fat Amy showing her how to do the last tradition: christening the house by sliding down the staircase.  In a mid-credits scene, Bumper performs ""All of Me"" on The Voice, chooses Christina Aguilera as his coach and makes her uncomfortable when he gives her an oddly lengthy hug.

731,"Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt relationship problems have reportedly existed for months, with signs ranging from her rapid weight loss to a fragile 79 pounds to increasing rumors of his flirtations with co-stars on his movie sets. And now, amid a new report that Jolie and Pitt were arguing over whose career should take priority, comes the news that Brad has exited from Top Gear, according to Design & Trend‘s sources.  Pitt had initially been viewed as the ideal person for show’s return. But when Brad abruptly changed his mind, Top Gear was left in shambles. As to why the famous actor would leave a show in the lurch?  Are Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie headed for a divorce? [Photo by Jonathan Leibson/Getty Images for Audi]  Brad, 52, and Angelina, 40, are battling over who should care for their children, with a source explaining that the two had agreed to take turns minding the kids and pursuing career ambitions.  “They’re at war over who’s looking after the kids since that agreement got blown out the window with her desire to turn her directing career into a success after several failures. This is tearing them apart, but Brad’s got no choice.”  Pitt is pointing to his efforts to help Angelina in her ambitions to become a director, but he feels that he has gone above and beyond by participating in her “flop,” By the Sea. In addition, Design & Trend cites a friend of Jolie’s who describes the problems she’s had in her life and how they affect her now.  “Angie has some serious dark demons that have never entirely let go and it is still affecting her life and marriage,” revealed one friend. “Her wild lifestyle when she was younger and her intense surgeries to avoid getting breast and ovarian cancer have taken a toll on her as a person and a life partner.”  Angelina Jolie looks frail at a reported 79 pounds. [Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images]  With her past issues catching up with her, Angelina tends to isolate herself from both her husband and her children, claims that pal. And although Brad first liked the “dark side” of Jolie, he increasingly feels that she’s pushing him away.  “It can be really hard on him. He feels he has been more than patient with Angie, but his confidence in their happiness is wearing thin,” added the friend.  Adding to the problems in their marriage, Angelina is jealous that Pitt spends so much time with actress Marion Cotillard, according to an insider cited by Hollywood Life, which describes Jolie as “wasting away” over her husband’s affair, weighing only 79 pounds.  Angelina Jolie serves as special envoy of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. [Photo by Milos Bicanski/Getty Images]  Although Marion is his co-star and their time together is on the movie set, Angelina is still furious, pushing Brad to consider divorce. Although no romantic affairs have taken place, Pitt has been gushing about Marion, explained the insider.  “The resentment has been eating away at Angelina. She’s prone to think that since she was once Brad’s co-star and seduced him away from his wife, the same will happen to her.”  That reference to how Jolie “seduced” Pitt away from his spouse refers to Jennifer Aniston. But the problem here is that rather than having Marion seduce Brad away from Angelina, it’s Jolie’s own jealousy and refusal to listen to him that is pushing Pitt to file for divorce, claims the insider.  “He will be the one to file. He’s fed up with her controlling ways, her obstinateness when it comes to listening to him about her health issues and how she needs to slow down and now her outright jealousy when it comes to other women,” added the source.  As to parallels to Pitt’s marriage and divorce from Jennifer Aniston, that drama began in 2004 when Brad started working on the 2005 movie Mr. and Mrs. Smith and became intimately acquainted with the woman who would become his girlfriend and then his wife, Angelina, as the Inquisitr reported.  Pitt and Jolie reportedly began their relationship during that film, with Brad subsequently confessing that he “fell in love” with Angelina on the movie set. He divorced Aniston by fall 2005, and Jolie announced her pregnancy with his child in January 2006.  Will Angelina suffer the same fate as Jennifer? Post your thoughts below.  [Photo by Alberto E.

4397,"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Harry Styles is secretly dating food blogger and model Tess Ward, The Sun’s Bizarre column can reveal.  The former One Direction star, 23, has enjoyed a string of dates with the London-based chef — after being introduced by mutual friends.  And pals close to the singer say that unlike his other flings, Styles is really taken with Ward, 27, known for her “Naked Diet” cookbook, and believe they’re set for a long-term relationship.  A source said: “As soon as Harry met Tess, there was an instant spark between them. They really bonded over their mutual love of quirky fashion and food — and things turned romantic quickly. They’ve been on a number of dates while Harry has been in London and he’s already introduced Tess to some of his close friends including his personal stylist Lou Teasdale. This really seems different to Harry’s past relationships as Harry genuinely is besotted with Tess and doesn’t want to risk messing this one up.”  Ward has been dubbed “cooking’s new golden girl” by fans. She released her first book, “The Naked Diet,” in 2015 after being trained by top chefs in The Ritz and River Cottage.  She is also a model and well known on the fashion circuit, having worked with former “Made in Chelsea” stars Millie Mackintosh and Rosie Fortescue, as well as Simon Le Bon’s model daughter Amber Le Bon.  Like her new boyfriend Styles, who released his debut solo single “Sign of the Times” last month, Tess is also a hit stateside and has been offered a host of TV and modeling opportunities in the US.  Writing on her LinkedIn profile, the chef, who has a degree in art history, reveals: “Current projects include a number of exciting TV and online projects in the US and UK.”  Styles went public with his new girlfriend last weekend as he was pictured driving Tess around north London in his luxury Audi.  The new couple looked relaxed together as they sat in traffic — and Styles even risked a fine and six points on his license as he used his phone behind the wheel.  Styles recently revealed that he is changing the way he dates women after failed relationships with Taylor Swift, Caroline Flack and Kendall Jenner.  He said: “I used to research dates, then I said I’m not going to do that anymore, it’s impossible to go in without a perception of someone and you’ve never met them and I started feeling like that was wrong and weird.”",fake

1862,"Beyonce is completely unbothered by Wendy Williams’ auto-tone diss, and we’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why she wants to challenge the talk show host to a sing-off.  Wendy Williams certainly should have thought twice before coming for Beyonce, 36. After hearing Wendy slam her vocal skills on Feb. 20, Queen Bey is ready to set the record straight. “If Beyonce really worried about what Wendy Williams said then Beyonce would not be Beyonce. She is so far above that chatter. She just had to laugh it off. But, if Wendy ever wanted to put her money where her mouth is she would welcome a sing-off between the two to show who can really sing, and who is just a big bag of hot air!” a source close to Bey tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. If Beyonce and Wendy were to battle it out, we think Yonce would have an unfair advantage. After all, the “Run The World” singer has 20 Grammy Awards, and has been on the music scene for over a decade. She’s a pretty intimidating musician to go up against, right?  But, before Beyonce could even defend herself, the Bey Hive came to her rescue. A lot of angry fans took to Twitter to unleash their wrath on Wendy. “Why would Wendy Williams EVER come for the queen like that,” one user tweeted. “Beyonce NEEDS auto tune?! Where? Are you dumb?!” another fan said angrily. But for all of you loyal fans out there, Beyonce wasn’t the only artist on Wendy’s auto-tune list. “There are only a few people who can sing raw-dog and Fergie is not one, she needs auto-tune. Jen[nifer] Lopez needs auto-tune and Janet [Jackson] need auto-tune,” Wendy explained to her audience. Wendy’s harsh words came after Fergie delivered a shocking rendition of the U.S. national anthem at the NBA All-Star Game on Feb. 18.  Despite Fergie’s attempt to put a personal twist on the beloved song, fans were just not into it, and Wendy was no exception. Fergie received so much backlash for the anthem that she even turned the comment section off on her Instagram posts! So sad, right? Nevertheless, we all make mistakes, and Fergie’s performance certainly doesn’t discredit her as a musician! We still love The Dutchess!

13172,"Do I need a British accent? Barack Obama asks as Prince Harry interviews him for radio show  world  Updated: Dec 19, 2017 08:48 IST  What happens when a prince interviews a president? Well, if this teaser of Britain’s Prince Harry interviewing former US president Barack Obama is anything to go by, the answer is a lot of fun.  On Prince Harry’s request, Barack Obama agreed to star in a guest edition of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Kensington Palace shared the trailer on Sunday,where Harry can be seen joking with Obama.  In the preview, Obama asks Harry if he has to speak quickly, since he is a slow speaker. “Do I need a British accent?” jokes Obama.  In turn, Harry tells the former president that if he takes long pauses between answers, he will get “the face”.  “Let me see the face”, asks Obama, leading Prince Harry to pull an exaggerated mock-grimace. “I don’t want to see that face,” the former president says.  Here is a sneak preview of when @BarackObama met Prince Harry for the interview. Listen to the full interview on 27th December on @BBCr4today. pic.twitter.com/p5I1dUdyhx — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) December 17, 2017  The trailer also shows Prince Harry saying that while Obama is excited, he is feeling nervous. “I’ll interview you if you want,” says Obama. “Let’s keep it this way, I’d much prefer that,” replies Harry.  Harry and Obama are known for their rapport and their very public exchanges of sassy banter. Who can forget the British royal’s Twitter ‘war’ with the Obamas while promoting the 2015 Invictus Games, which lead to Harry’s by-now-famous ‘mic drop’ moment? Not even the Queen.  Invictus Games is a Paralympic sporting event for injured or sick armed forces personnel, that was found by Prince Harry in 2014.  Harry and Obama hung out at this year’s Invictus Games in Toronto in September, joking, cheering and taking selfies with fans. Social media gushed over the bromance, spinning memes around it.  The full 40-minute interview will air December 27 on England’s BBC Radio 4 Today.",real

4831,"Update (September 21, 2:50 P.M.): A source close to the couple tells VF.com that the report they are married is false.  The original post continues below.  When one celebrity marriage ends, another begins (that’s how that saying goes, right?). Fresh off the news that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are getting divorced—which you might have heard; it was written up in a few periodicals yesterday and will possibly be covered today as well—Us Weekly is reporting that notoriously private couple Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes are married. Not only did they allegedly tie the knot, they may have done so earlier this year. They’re newlyweds, and have been for quite some time.  “Multiple sources reveal in the new issue of Us Weekly” that Gosling and “his love of five years, Eva Mendes, quietly tied the knot earlier this year among a small group of family and friends.” Another source goes on to say that, “Eva and Ryan have always felt like a married couple. . . . They are infatuated with each other.”  Anonymous sources live for getting Shakespearean-sonnet levels of romantic when describing two people’s love for one another. We assume Us cut the part where the source compared Mendes and Gosling’s love to a summer’s day, saying it’s more lovely and more temperate.  Gosling and Mendes have always been extremely private about their relationship. They met on the set of 2012’s The Place Beyond the Pines and have since had two daughters together. They welcomed Esmeralda Amada in September 2014 and Amada Lee in April 2016.  “All of them are doing amazing. I’m a lucky man; they really make me better,” Gosling recently told Us Weekly at TIFF when asked about his life with Mendes and their two daughters. No one thought to ask, “Hey, Ryan, did you by any chance get married this year?,” though, so for that, we’ll have to rely on TMZ to get his tax returns. Just kidding, TMZ; please do not track down Ryan Gosling’s taxes. We’re content with this report from Us Weekly about the mere idea that he and Mendes might be married right now, because Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are working towards the legal dissolution of theirs.  VF.com has reached out to representatives for Gosling and Mendes and will update this story when more information becomes available.",real
6142,"ABC’s fairytale drama series Once Upon A Time will end with the current Season 7, Deadline has confirmed.  The show, created and executive produced by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, returns for the second half of its final season on March 2, and the finale will air in May, after more than 150 episodes.  Once Upon a Time went through a creative and casting revamp at the end of Season 6 when a number of original cast members left, and also relocated from its longtime Sunday home to the lower-trafficked Friday night this season. During the TCA winter press tour in January, ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey said she was “cautiously optimistic” about an eighth season, pending a meeting with Kitsis and Horowitz, but that was not to be.  “When we first heard Adam and Eddy’s pitch for Once Upon a Time, we knew it was something incredibly special,” Dungey said in a statement today. “For seven years, they have captivated us with their creativity and passion while reimagining some of our most beloved Disney fairytales, creating an undeniable global hit. Saying goodbye will be bittersweet, but Once Upon a Time’ will forever be part of the ABC legacy and we can’t wait for fans to join us in this epic final chapter.”  Once Upon a Time was a breakout hit when it premiered in fall 2011, starring Ginnifer Goodwin, Jennifer Morrison, Lana Parrilla, Josh Dallas, Robert Carlyle and Jared Gilmore, and featuring classic Disney fairytale characters. In addition to strong ratings early in its run, Once fit nicely in the Disney brand with corporate synergies and has been a solid international seller for producer ABC Studios because of the global recognition of its characters.  “’Once Upon a Time has been an amazing journey for all of us at ABC Studios and for fans around the world,” said Patrick Moran, president of ABC Studios. “We’re so proud and appreciative of the hard work and creative talent that Eddy Kitsis, Adam Horowitz and their cast and crew brought to this show for seven magical seasons.”  Once Upon a Time’s ratings had been declining for the past few seasons and further dropped when the show moved from Sunday to Friday this past fall. The series, whose Season 7 reboot was met by mixed reaction by fans, currently stars Lana Parrilla, Robert Carlyle, Colin O’Donoghue, Andrew J. West, Gabrielle Anwar, Dania Ramirez, Alison Fernandez and Mekia Cox. Steve Pearlman and David H. Goodman also are executive producing.  “Seven years ago, we set out to create a show about hope, where even in the darkest of times, a happy ending would always be possible,” said Once creators/executive producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. ” But we never imagined the happy ending that was actually in store for all of us — years and years of adventure, romance, magic and hope. We’re so grateful to our brilliant collaborators – the cast, crew, and writers — as well as our partners at the studio and network for making this journey possible. But most of all, we want to thank the fans. Their fierce loyalty and devotion was the real magic behind Once Upon A Time. We hope they join us for these last few hours as we journey to the Enchanted Forrest for one more adventure.”",real
8747,"Our September cover story, “A Life in Bold,” a portrait of actress Angelina Jolie by contributing editor Evgenia Peretz, has been the subject of some controversy, specifically the paragraph that follows, which describes the casting of Cambodian children in Jolie’s upcoming film, First They Killed My Father:  “To cast the children in the film, Jolie looked at orphanages, circuses, and slum schools, specifically seeking children who had experienced hardship. In order to find their lead, to play young Loung Ung, the casting directors set up a game, rather disturbing in its realism: they put money on the table and asked the child to think of something she needed the money for, and then to snatch it away. The director would pretend to catch the child, and the child would have to come up with a lie. ‘Srey Moch [the girl ultimately chosen for the part] was the only child that stared at the money for a very, very long time,’ Jolie says. ‘When she was forced to give it back, she became overwhelmed with emotion. All these different things came flooding back.’ Jolie then tears up. ‘When she was asked later what the money was for, she said her grandfather had died, and they didn’t have enough money for a nice funeral.’”  Some reporters and readers raised concerns about the casting process. Jolie responded in a statement, saying the audition had been taken out of context, and added she was upset that “a pretend exercise in an improvisation . . . had been written about as if it was a real scenario.” She also stated “the suggestion that real money was taken from a child during an audition is false and upsetting. I would be outraged myself if this had happened.”  On August 1, Jolie’s lawyer contacted V.F., saying Peretz had “mistakenly” reported the incident, and asked us to run a statement, excerpts of which follow: “The casting crew showed the children the camera and sound recording material, explaining to them that they were going to be asked to act out a part. . . . The children were not tricked as some have suggested. . . . All of the children auditioning were made aware of the fictional aspect of the exercise and were tended to at all times by relatives or guardians from NGOs. . . . We apologize for any misunderstanding.”  Jolie’s lawyer also asked us to remove the original paragraph from the online version of Peretz’s story and to publish the above statement prominently, with the title “Angelina Jolie Correction” in the October edition of V.F. and also on VF.com.",real
18841,"We are one week away from the end of the world. Well, the AHS world that is.  On September 12, American Horror Story: Apocalypse will premiere on FX and if the trailer is any indication the fallout will have near-biblical proportions.  We already know the AHS universe has a guaranteed 10 seasons, but with only seven days until the Apocalypse premiere... we can't get too ahead of ourselves. So let's try theorizing with what we've got.  Here's everything we do and don't know about the impending doom of Apocalypse.    The end of the world hits October 2019 (and other timeline details)  Back in April, creator Ryan Murphy teased Season 8's timeframe during an Emmy FYC panel saying it took place ""18 months from today."" That puts our apocalyptic end sometime during October of next year. (Yes, this contradicts Murphy's earlier statement that Apocalypse would take place 10 to 20 years in the future.)  Season 8's first episode is fittingly titled ""The End,"" meaning our story, in the words of EP Alexis Martin, ""begins with the end of the world and then our world begins."" That being said, AHS will likely explore the lead-up to the disaster as well.  Seriously, flashbacks are almost as big an AHS staple as surprising sex scenes.      Season 8 is the long awaited Murder House/Coven crossover  The promise of the Harmons and the witches of Miss Robichaux's Academy pairing up for a season of chaos has been rumored for awhile... but Murphy didn't officially confirm the connection until June.  The Coven/Murder House AHS crossover season won't be happening next year...because it's happening THIS YEAR. AHS #8 WITCHES RULE THIS SEPTEMBER — Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) June 14, 2018  Since then, Murphy has posted shots of the Murder House and Coven casts on familiar sets. Viviene and Ben Harmon are seen here in what looks a lot like the Los Angeles Murder House.  Connie, Sarah and Dylan. The Harmon’s are scaring up drama at The Murder House with Director Supreme Paulson. pic.twitter.com/L6e9N3LTtY — Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) August 25, 2018  And here we've got the coven posing on a mod-staircase fit for their New Orleans home.  The Coven Returns. What a thrilling night with the legend Stevie Nicks on the set of AHS. pic.twitter.com/wsI1FlfN1W — Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) August 19, 2018  It's unclear how AHS plans to bring these geographically different stories into the same arena. Personally, I'm hoping for a Zombieland style, post-apocalyptic search for Twinkies, but that may not be possible given the radiation levels...  That evil baby/Antichrist from Murder House is back  That explains all the scary fetus promos.  Excited to announce Cody Fern will be playing the role of Michael Langdon in American Horror Story: Apocalypse. Premieres September 12 on FX. pic.twitter.com/kFYQ2GAncd — Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) July 26, 2018  In July, Murphy announced that American Crime Story alumnus Cody Fern would be assuming the role of grown-up Michael Langdon — son of Viviene Harmon and Tate Langdon. Which is great news considering Fern's evident acting chops... but also presents a confusing timeline.  If Apocalypse is set in 2019 and Michael was born in 2012, then this little Beelzebub baby is growing up super fast. Or we're looking at a dash of demonic 13 Going on 30.  We got our first glimpse of the age-defying world-ender in AHS's first teaser trailer and he looked a lot like Edward Mordrake of Freak Show. I would say it was just a coincidence, but... is anything in AHS ever a coincidence?  Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, and Stevie Nicks (among others) will return  Guess who's coming back for AHS APOCALYPSE? Taissa Farmiga, Gabourey Sidibe, Lily Rabe, Frances Conroy and....Stevie Nicks. So thrilled the family is together again! #AHSApocalypse — Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) August 7, 2018  Sadly, powerhouse Angela Bassett won't be returning for this season of American Horror Story. However, the equally legendary Kathy Bates and Stevie Nicks will make appearances.  The long awaited return of early series star Jessica Lange as Murder House's Constance Langdon has also been confirmed.  As if that wasn't enough (c'mon, I'd pay anything to see that three-woman show), plenty of other series' alumni — including Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson, Emma Roberts, Adina Porter, Billie Lourd, Cheyenne Jackson, Lily Rabe, Frances Conroy, Connie Britton, Billy Eichner and many, many more — will return for Season 8.  Yes, even Rubber Man... in whatever form that takes.      Some actors will be doubling-up  No, not in a Bette and Dot kinda way—though Sarah Paulson will be plenty busy. Given the collision of anthologies set to unfold, a number of performers will reprise old roles as well as new ones.  Sarah Paulson is set to portray the still Supreme Cordelia Foxx of Coven and Craigslist medium Billie Dean Howard of Murder House—alongside her new Apocalypse character, Venable, first introduced through the clip below.  Evan Peters will similarly bring back the weirdly hunky Tate of Murder House and venture into new territory with an Apocalypse original character Murphy said was a ""comedic hairstylist.""  Taissa Farmiga, also a Coven and Murder House veteran, will rock both her roles as Zoe Benson and Violet Harmon. I'm not sure how much the young witch can do for us in the end of days, but I'm pretty stoked the Antichrist's half-sister is around... something tells me we're gonna need her thoughts.  Other crossover castings are possible, but not yet confirmed.  Joan Collins is joining the cast  If this isn't resonating with you as a big deal, that's okay. Take a mere 200-ish hours to watch all of the 1980's soap opera Dynasty. Don't worry, I will wait for you. This is important.  All done? Perfect. Joan Collins is (as you now know) a delightful, devilish legend. Her addition to the AHS universe is a gift and we need to treat it as such.  Outside of Collins playing Evan Peters' grandmother, very little is known about her role.  However, we do know how she got it. Turns out Collins met Ryan Murphy at the Vanity Fair Oscar party, mentioned the show, and two weeks later got an offer. Could this woman and her career be anymore supremely glamorous? (Get it? Supreme? Seriously, there is no way this woman is not a coven leader... right?)      And Billy Porter  Yep. The Pose icon is shuffling over to the dark and twisted parts of the Murphy-verse.  Very little is know about Porter's character, though set photos imply he is Coven related.  ""All I can say is dreams do come true,"" Porter said of the opportunity. ""They may not come when you want them, but it’s all right on time. Keep on fighting, keep on showing up for your life. Keep on pushing. I’m a living witness that dreams come true. You change the world when you change your mind, and we all can make a difference in this world.""  The glamor is gonna get weird  With Evan Peters and Joan Collins' stylish castings plus the fabulous gowns in the trailer taken into account, the gorey but glamorous promos AHS has been rolling out make a bit more sense.  This ""haircut"" clip is almost as chic as the new dark, pixie Kathy Bates is rocking for her role as Ms. Meade.  And the whole sucking the life out of someone feels very Fiona Goode of Coven.  Overall, we can probably expect more of the sleek style and finesse we saw in Coven—even if it's the end of the world. (Rapture or no rapture, that dark lipstick on Sarah Paulson could kill anyone. Goodness gracious.)  Expect something crazy to go down in Episode 5  What could be more intense than the apparent nuclear apocalypse of the trailer? Personally, I don't know, but there is allegedly a ""huge thing that happens in Episode 5."" In a conversation with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy alluded to the big midseason development, calling it the season's ""hook.""  Notably, Episode 6 has a Murder House-heavy cast lined up with Sarah Paulson in the director's chair. Not sure what that means for the preceding episode, but we could be looking at a flashback.      ""Hail, Satan.""  Okay, so you heard Kathy Bates say that at the end of the trailer too?  Clearly, the Satanic overtones of Apocalypse are not going to be subtle, Sarah Paulson is going to be far from sweet, and that bunker is going to be Hell on Earth.  Do we have a 10 Cloverfield Lane situation on our hands? A Handmaid's Tale situation on our hands? Just tell me. What do we have on our hands?!  Looks like only time will tell. One more week, horror fans.  American Horror Story: Apocalypse premieres Wednesday, September 12 at 9pm on FX.",real

3655,"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.  “The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  Image zoom NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.”  RELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie Are Today’s New Anchor Team  As for future projects, Couric is focused on her new documentary series as well as her popular podcast — and teaching her husband John Molner about social media.  “I’m having so much fun doing my podcast with my friend Brian Goldsmith,” she says. “I’ve been able to have extended and substantive conversations with so many great, interesting people, like Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Alec Baldwin, David Axelrod, Ava DuVernay and Ina Garten.

The so-called Tax March is smaller in scale than the Women’s March that drew an estimated 5+ million protesters worldwide following Trump’s inauguration in January, but still drawing vocal crowds across the country.  Those protesting today are primarily calling for Trump to disclose his tax returns. During his candidacy, Trump promised he would release his taxes after the IRS completed their audit of them. He has not. (Note, Trump’s 2016 taxes will immediately be under audit this year.)

994,"Blake Shelton may have moved on from Miranda Lambert, but that doesn’t mean their relationship doesn’t still haunt him through her music. HollywoodLife.com has learned EXCLUSIVELY that Blake is totally terrified that Miranda may never stop singing about him!  “Blake [Shelton] is genuinely happy for all of Miranda [Lambert]‘s success,” an insider told HollywoodLife.com of how the 40-year-old “Came Here to Forget” singer feels about his 33-year-old ex-wife. “Blake is not surprised at all that Miranda wrote so many hit songs about her heartbreak because their marriage was full of passion, drinking and love. All the things that make for a great country song.”  [interaction id=”58e2d17e91ffef776d19a634″]  “Blake is relieved to have moved on from the most challenging time in his life, but he worries that Miranda has enough material to write several more albums about their time together,” the source continued. “Blake is hoping that Miranda finds new inspiration for her music and that she doesn’t spend the rest of her life singing about him.”  Though Blake might be irritated by the idea that Miranda could be singing about him for years to come, he has definitely got too many good things going on in his life to be too concerned about it. The country music crooner has been happily involved with fellow Voice coach Gwen Stefani, 47, since the fall of 2015 and is only growing closer with her and her family by the day.  In fact Gwen’s little boys — Kingston, 10, Zuma, 8, and Apollo, 3– idolize Blake so much that they recently drew temporary versions of the singer’s tattoo on their own arms so they could be more like him!

Sure the38-year-old reality star hits the gym regularly, but it’s her clean eating habits that help her “stay on track.”  “I try to eat healthy and include as many organic whole foods as possible,” Kardashian writes in a new post on her website, which details her “current meal plan.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  When the mom-of-three wakes up, before even thinking about food, she takes collagen supplements on an empty stomach followed by a glass of water mixed with one tablespoon of organic apple cider vinegar 20 minutes later. “Both of these habits have a ton of health benefits that affect everything from your skin to the way your body processes nutrients,” Kardashian explains. The apple cider vinegar blend, known to help with weight loss, is in her daily regimen twice along with vegan probiotics shots—both before breakfast and dinner.  Before the star hits the gym for a good sweat, without fail, she enjoys her fresh avocado pudding. “It only takes a few minutes to make and it provides healthy fats to give me energy before a workout,” she says. And after that she fills up on whole grain oatmeal—but not the instant variety—made fresh on the stove.  Image zoom Rich Fury/Getty  For lunch time, Kardashian loves her greens. You can find her eating a salad with some good protein like chicken or salmon. But to truly eat like the star, toss the bottled dressings. Kardashian sticks to making her own as she lives a life mostly void of sugar and nearly anything processed.

2617,"This week, in the midst of rising panic and gathering storms, some lucky paparazzi spotted the tabloid equivalent of the Loch Ness Monster.  In an industry of repetitive stories, unsubstantiated rumors, and Bachelor covers, these fateful shots of Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes holding hands on the beach in Malibu immediately made waves. To understand the magnitude of Holmes and Foxx’s PDA, you have to venture back four years ago, to a pre-Trump era when Brangelina was still a thing and nobody knew what a Chainsmoker was. In 2013, photos surfaced of Foxx and Holmes dancing together at a Hamptons charity event. Ever since then, the rumored duo has gone to great lengths to insist that they’re just friends, with varying degrees of success. In an October 2013 interview, Foxx called the dating rumors “one hundred percent not true.” Again in 2015, Foxx strongly reacted to the relationship rumors, retorting, “What I’ve learned about society today is that they’re so thirsty. Especially in tabloid world and social media world, they’re so thirsty to find any story… Sometimes when you read the stuff you’re like, ‘Wow! That’s so not true!’” Holmes has refused to engage with the topic altogether. When pressed on her relationship status in 2016, the actress replied, “That’s not something I want to answer.”  Despite JamKat’s press defensive, there have been numerous leaks over the course of the alleged half-decade that they’ve been allegedly dating. A blurry 2015 photo of the duo holding hands in a recording studio is perhaps the most damning evidence, along with a 2016 interview with Foxx’s friend, reality TV star Claudia Jordan, who gushed that Foxx “is very happy with [Holmes].” Jordan quickly walked back her inadvertent confirmation, subsequently telling ET that, “I have no knowledge of Jamie with Katie at all,” adding, “I’ve never seen them together. He’s never told me he’s dating her.”  Still, as months and years passed, rumors of this celebrity coupling persisted. Anonymous sources insisted on Jamie and Katie’s relationship status and tabloids, sensing a story even bigger and more factually accurate than Jennifer Aniston’s phantom pregnancy, never gave up. While any secret celebrity dating scenario is fodder for a People cover or a clickbait headline, JamKat is a particularly elusive and fascinating pairing. That’s because Foxx and Holmes’ intense secrecy is rumored to be a condition of Holmes’ 2012 divorce from Tom Cruise, which was itself the ending of one of the most widely discussed and analyzed marriages in celebrity history.  Long before Holmes and Cruise started dating, the leading man had a reputation for strange behavior—the alleged result of his close relationship with the Church of Scientology.  One of the main celebrity faces of Scientology, Cruise appeared to have, at some point, handed over the reins of his personal life to the church. In Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, Alex Gibney’s 2015 documentary, Marty Rathbun, a former high-ranking Scientologist, confesses that he was assigned to sabotage Cruise’s second marriage: “I was to facilitate the breakup with Nicole Kidman.”  According to the film, Scientology head David Miscavige—a good friend of Cruise’s—became suspicious of Kidman when she began to influence Cruise away from the church. Gibney’s film claims that over the course of their marriage, Cruise even stopped returning Miscavige’s calls. At that point, the documentary alleges, Miscavige resolved to get Kidman out of the picture. Rathbun elaborates that this campaign included spying on/wiretapping Kidman, “auditing” Cruise, and “re-educating” the couple’s adopted children, Connor and Isabella. This all culminated in 2001, when Cruise divorced Kidman.  A 2012 Vanity Fair article claimed that Miscavige subsequently made it his mission in 2004 to find Cruise a new girlfriend. Maureen Orth reported that, “The organization devised an elaborate auditioning process in which actresses who were already Scientology members were called in, told they were auditioning for a new training film, and then asked a series of curious questions including: ‘What do you think of Tom Cruise?’” The search party, Orth reported, eventually landed on Homeland actress Nazanin Boniadi. Between 2004 and 2005, Boniadi reportedly dated the actor: “In a month-long preparation in October 2004, she was audited every day, a process in which she told a high-ranking Scientology official her innermost secrets and every detail of her sex life. Boniadi allegedly was told to lose her braces, her red highlights, and her boyfriend.”  When Boniadi was eventually flown to New York to meet her new boyfriend, she was given a confidentiality agreement “specifically about Cruise,” claimed Vanity Fair. And while the relationship was initially successful, the actress quickly found herself running afoul of both Cruise and Miscavige: “By the third week in January, she was asked to move into Scientology’s Celebrity Centre. Boniadi was told that Cruise ‘wants someone with her own power—like Nicole.’ When she asked why Cruise would not break up with her himself, she was told he was not to be disturbed.” (The Church of Scientology did not respond to The Daily Beast’s requests for comment prior to publication.)  By April of 2005, Cruise was dating actress Katie Holmes, and just one month later he was enthusiastically holding forth on his budding relationship while jumping on Oprah Winfrey’s couch.  According to journalist Tony Ortega, who’s covered the church since 1995, “Katie made the effort initially to become a Scientologist herself, and then escaped later.” Ortega told The Daily Beast about the actress’ Scientology handler, Jessica Rodriguez, who was reportedly assigned to accompany Holmes during the Batman Begins press tour, recalling, “Jessica was answering questions for Katie in interviews, and it was really, really weird.” Rumors of strange behavior and restrictions abounded during the couples’ six-year marriage. (Miscavige was Cruise’s best man at his and Holmes’ 2006 wedding.) According to one particularly striking claim, Cruise allegedly insisted that “his wife stay silent while she was giving birth to baby Suri,” in keeping with Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard’s belief that absolute silence ought to be maintained throughout delivery.  As The Daily Beast previously reported, the final straw allegedly came when Holmes began to suspect that she would soon be separated from her and Cruise’s young daughter, Suri: “When Cruise and Holmes split in 2012, it was amidst rumors that the star feared her husband was planning to ship their daughter Suri off to Sea Org—an elite training division of the Church that requires its members to sign a ‘billion-year contract.’” Cruise and Holmes’ hasty settlement, which was finalized just 10 days after Holmes filed for divorce, reportedly stipulated that Suri would have no relationship with the Church of Scientology. Unfortunately, this agreement appears to have wreaked havoc on Suri’s relationship with her father, as the two are rarely seen together. In late June, InTouch reported that Cruise hadn’t seen his 11-year-old daughter in person in “more than 1,381 days.” This alleged separation is less shocking in light of the church’s practice of “disconnecting” congregants from family members who disapprove of Scientology.  A RadarOnline report from last year alleged Holmes and Foxx’s secrecy may also be a result of that high-stakes divorce settlement. The gossip site published a source who claimed that, “Katie signed a clause in her quickie divorce settlement that prevents her from embarrassing Tom in various ways, like talking about him or Scientology, or publicly dating another man for five years after the divorce.  “She’s allowed to date, but she cannot do so in a public fashion, and she’s not supposed to let any boyfriend near their daughter, Suri,” the source continued. “Katie wanted out of the marriage so badly, she agreed to the terms—and got $4.8 million in child support, plus another $5 million for herself.”  And the timing works out: Holmes and Cruise finalized their divorce in June 2012, meaning that the exes have only recently passed the five-year mark. If the rumors are true, Holmes and Foxx are now free to shout their love from the couches without fear of reprisal from Holmes’ bizarre ex.",fake
8293,"TV Reviews All of our TV reviews in one convenient place. Prev Next View All  Advertisement  This Game Of Thrones review is written for those who have read George R.R. Martin’s A Song Of Ice And Fire. It will not explicitly spoil events from those books that have not yet been adapted into the series, but it will address events from the books more broadly in the interest of exploring the process of adapting them into a series. More explicit spoilers for (potential) future events will come in a separate section at the end of the review. All discussion in the comments is valid, up to and including the events of the fifth book, but we ask that you clearly mark spoilers just in case (although we acknowledge that this is less relevant now than it was before the show “caught up.”) For those who have not read the books, you can read if you would like, but proceed with caution following the spoiler warning, and check out our reviews for newbies. Since critics won’t be receiving screeners this season, each week I’ll publish the episode page once the broadcast ends and add my review to the page when I finish.  One of the distinctive qualities of reading A Song Of Ice And Fire is the stretches you can go without checking in with certain characters. Even if you discount the wait between books, and the absence of certain characters in A Feast For Crows and the early chapters of A Dance With Dragons, you often go considerable lengths within a given book without seeing certain characters thanks to the POV chapter structure. And so while we could focus on Bran’s absence from A Feast For Crows—mirrored by his absence in season five—we could also focus on his absence for a 21-chapter stretch in A Dance With Dragons.  Reading the books, though, I got used to these absences. While I would sometimes get impatient if I went too long between certain characters’ chapters—although this was not the case with those ADWD Bran chapters—I didn’t find myself spending each chapter wondering what those characters were up to. The singular focus of the chapters is incredibly immersive, reconnecting you to a location, a set of characters, and a situation, and then spending a decent amount of time there.  By comparison, though, the show can’t necessarily do the same. Although episodes like “Blackwater,” “The Watchers On The Wall,” and “Hardhome”—among others—have replicated this tight focus on a single scenario, most episodes jump between stories often, rarely creating the same sense of immersion. Accordingly, however, it becomes less viable for the show to ignore a character for extended periods without the audience starting to ask questions. Those questions are not necessarily a problem—it gives the show a point of dramatic interest, provided that their return explains the missing time and reactivates our interest in the character. But for me, absences are more notable on the show than they were in the books, where the disappearances could be explained away as a byproduct of Martin’s chosen structure.  Advertisement  Littlefinger’s absence in the first part of this season was somewhat odd. More than any other character, Game Of Thrones has famed Petyr Baelish as someone who is always making moves, which makes his absences more notable than when Yara Greyjoy disappeared for over a season, or when we don’t check into Dorne for three consecutive weeks. It was entirely reasonable to presume that the show was just going to write out the Greyjoy storyline, for example, but we knew there was no chance that Littlefinger wasn’t going to involve himself in the coming conflict. And given how quickly the character has teleported around Westeros in the past, it didn’t make sense that he would have spent so long in transit, and thus knowing he would be appearing in this week’s episode I wondered what he might have been up to offscreen.  The answer was very little. Littlefinger drops in to visit Lord Robin, delivering him a name day gift of a falcon and using his mind games to convince Lord Royce and the Knights of the Vale to ride north to assist Sansa in her fight against Ramsay. And that’s it. What has Littlefinger been doing in the time that has passed in the season so far, as other characters have made crucial steps forward in their respective journeys? He’s been in his cart, accomplishing nothing more than a falcon purchase along the way, apparently. After hoping that his absence would lead to the start of a meaningful new storyline, the brief scene we get from Littlefinger more or less justifies the decision to ignore the character: whatever long game he’s playing with the Vale, it remains almost remarkably insignificant as far as the central narrative is concerned. And therein lies the danger in keeping someone off-screen for too long: when you bring them back just to remind us they’re alive, it only serves to remind us they’re not being utilized.  Advertisement  We will see in the weeks to come how the show manages the similar return of the Ironborn, but Theon’s reunion with Yara helps anchor the story in the character we’ve spent the most time with (and which the show resisted sidelining as the books did, albeit mainly to begin the seemingly unending parade of evidence to make absolute certain we know that Ramsay is a terrible person which—we get it already). Yara may not register as a major character, but the show made good use of their tragic last meeting where he refused her rescue, and the Kingsmoot now feels like something tied into the ongoing narrative rather than something more tangential, something that is likely to continue should the ships be heading east in the weeks to come.  Obviously, though, “Book Of The Stranger” is most powerful for its other sibling reunion, as two of the Starks finally reunite. It’s a great choice for a first reunion precisely because it’s not the reunion we would have wanted. Jon was closest to Arya out of his remaining siblings, and arguably it is also Arya who would have the more emotionally complicated reunion with Sansa as well. But Jon and Sansa were not close: he was sullen and removed, she was judgmental, and they never really bonded. And yet war has done things to them that make their reunion just as emotional as if they had been best friends, and perspective that helps them look back on the kids they were and wonder how things might have been different. They’re also two people who have complex relationships with the concept of leadership, and who are each at key turning points that temporarily take them in the opposite directions: Jon is tired of being a leader, and Sansa is tired of following orders.  Advertisement  There is not a great deal of elegance in the show’s introduction of the Pink Letter, or some variation of it. While some speculated the show was playing some type of game with Rickon and Osha being held captive, Ramsay quickly murders Osha to remove any chance of this having been a cunning plan on behalf of Rickon’s protector. The scene sells Osha short, and seems an ignoble end, but it creates the impulse for Sansa, Jon, and the Wildlings to get on the same page regarding marching on Winterfell. But the way that happens is subtle and smart: Jon doubts the veracity of Ramsay’s claims, and balks at reading the more hateful and grotesque threats it contains, but it’s Sansa who knows it’s true, and it’s Sansa who reads the rape threat and everything after it. While I’m delighted by this group regardless of how they came together—Melisandre and Brienne on the same side? Tormund smitten with Brienne? Podrick and Davos along for the ride?—the scene makes the bald setup of Littlefinger’s entrée into the affair all the more bald.  Advertisement  It’s also a reminder that as much as these characters have gone through, no one truly understands the other. After Missandei raises an eyebrow at Tyrion claiming that he was a slave for “long enough to know” how bad it was, she correctly notes it was “not long enough to understand.” And the same goes for Jon and Sansa: she can’t know the depths of his experiences at and beyond the Wall (I presume he skipped over the resurrection, although we can debate that in the comments), but he also can’t pretend to understand what happened to her at Winterfell (like the fact that the threat of rape has already been carried out before). The more characters reunite as the series draws to a close—and I expect many more reunions like this one—the more we will see characters articulating the distinction between “knowing” and “understanding” what has happened to them.  We could view the events in King’s Landing through this lens, as the threat of Margaery’s walk of shame pushes the Tyrells and Kevan into an alliance with Cersei and Jaime, or as Margaery consoles a damaged Loras who may be too far gone at the hands of the Faith Militant to move forward. But this story, more than the others in the episode, is being left fairly opaque. I feel like we know little and understand even less, as we’re seeing such selective moments in each character’s journey. The High Sparrow is a master wordsmith, demonstrating a clear understanding of how to break down privilege and tap into more basic human decency, but his agenda remains incredibly cryptic even as he’s made some pretty decent sense with both Tommen and Margaery in recent weeks. And while we see Tommen tell Cersei a secret, we don’t [definitively] learn what it is, or how it inspires her to parlay with the Queen of Thorns and Kevan. [Note: based on the comments, it’s clear that I wasn’t clear when I wrote this sentence. We know what the show implies the secret was: that Margaery was going to make a walk of atonement. I just read the scene in ambiguous ways, believing—and perhaps overthinking—that Cersei was being dishonest when she spoke with Kevan. We’ll see next week if my concerns is warranted, but that’s the nature of this comment.] It is here where the “knowing” and “understanding” run into problems as a book reader, where the story seems to be veering away from the presumed path (more on that below).  Advertisement  But the central philosophical conflict in the episode comes between Daenerys and the dwarf left behind to run her city. While aided at times by stealth and strategy, Daenerys has largely taken her power by force, and sees leadership through the lens of absolutes. But as Tyrion takes over Meereen, a city beset with problems created by Daenerys’ inability to keep slavery at bay outside of Meereen and the rise of the Sons of the Harpy, he is choosing to adopt a diplomatic approach more common in Westeros. In the process, as Missandei’s objection notes, he is complicating the rhetoric of freedom Daenerys stressed when she took power, and compromising the place of Grey Worm and Missandei as they are forced to support Tyrion’s plan to other former slaves. The moral compromise they’re making is central to leadership, but that compromise is somewhat lost on Tyrion, the outsider looking in. Meereen needed an outsider’s perspective in order to solve its problems, but that does not mean that the solution will come at no cost, as Tyrion has no doubt discovered before in his diplomatic efforts.  Advertisement  But even as “Book Of The Stranger”—so-named for the one of the seven that people rarely pray to—demonstrates the value of diplomacy, it also ends with Daenerys going back to her old bag of tricks. Much as with the Starks’ reunion, Daenerys’ return to Vaes Dothrak is about coming full circle, and reflecting on the show’s past. And in a microcosm of the character’s journey thus far, she asserts her authority over those who wish to control her, uses fire to eliminate her enemies, and then stages a theatrical moment amidst the flames that only adds to her growing legacy. There is no diplomacy here, replaced with theatricality and a belief in the power of shock and awe.  It’s an impressive scene, and manages to give Daenerys control over the entirety of the Dothraki (which is likely where Martin was heading in the books as well), but it’s not enough to rule Westeros. In pairing Tyrion and Dany in one of the show’s first major character convergences last season, the writers drew an important contrast: the statesman who knows how to rule, and the queen who knows how to conquer. Much as Jon and Sansa need one another to conquer the North, Tyrion and Dany need one another if they ever intend to lead Westeros. In fact, more than ever before, it’s becoming clear that all of our “heroes”—here defined as characters in Westeros who have any shred of decency—need one another in one way or another for the coming war with the threat that has remained offscreen since the season began: the White Walkers and their undead army, who remain at large waiting to reemerge at the least opportune time.  Advertisement  And something tells me we won’t be forgetting about them anytime soon.  Stray observations  So speaking of things happening off-screen: Davos had never asked Melisandre what happened to Stannis and Shireen? That seems incredibly unlikely to me, but it gives Brienne a chance to break the news she murdered him, and create some productive tension. But I know many wondered why Davos would be willing to work with Melisandre given Shireen’s fate, so here’s your answer: he never got the full story.    Along similar lines: do we think Jon told Sansa about being resurrected? How would you even tell that story to Sansa, who has been witness to no magic or zombies or anything like it? I have questions.    I’ll miss Dolorous Edd when we move away from Castle Black, as his eyebrow raise at Tormund eyeing Brienne was a nice reminder of the levity that could exist on the Wall at a time.    Kingsmoot Korner: I was interested to see no major setup for Euron here—it’s possible the Kingsmoot is further away than I thought (I didn’t get the preview for next week in Canada), but I expected a bit more time with the character before we dive right into Theon and Yara’s partnership.    I was interested to see no major setup for Euron here—it’s possible the Kingsmoot is further away than I thought (I didn’t get the preview for next week in Canada), but I expected a bit more time with the character before we dive right into Theon and Yara’s partnership. I wonder if they killed Shaggydog just so they would only have to CGI three direwolves in the epic final battle of the entire series—they’ve got to be thinking ahead at this point. (And yes, Nymeria is going to be there. I WILL NOT BELIEVE OTHERWISE.)    Although Emilia Clarke has stepped away from providing recurring nudity in the way she did in the first season, she confirmed to EW  Advertisement  The Night Is Dark And Full Of Spoilers (Or Informed Speculation, At Least)  So do we think this is the end of the CleganeBowl dreams?  It’s an interesting question. The show appears to be ramping up the King’s Landing storyline to some type of conflict ahead of Cersei’s trial, there has been no mention of trial by combat necessarily being a key climax for the storyline, and there has been zero groundwork laid for Sandor’s surprise return. All of this would seem to steer away from CleganeBowl as a viable option.  Advertisement  However, the show has very much resisted making the Faith Militant overly villainous, with the High Sparrow’s points about class quite reasonable even if his tactics are not. And it would be an interesting comeuppance for the Lannisters if the Hound emerged having cleansed himself of his sin, having walked away from his life of privilege and knighthood to embrace a simpler existence much as the High Sparrow did. And they did go through the hassle of introducing Zombie Gregor. And so we see a case where, similar to Lady Stoneheart, the thematic groundwork is there but the narrative structure remains missing. I’m curious to know where book readers stand on the odds with this one—are there odds? Do people wager on this? I have to think someone, somewhere, is doing Game Of Thrones prop bets.",real

Martinez and the jury for their careful consideration, my attorneys Doug Baldridge, Danielle Foley, Jay Schaudies and Katie Wright for fighting for me and anyone who feels silenced by a sexual assault, and especially anyone who offered their support throughout this four-year ordeal and two-year long trial process,” the 27-year-old singer said in a statement.  “I acknowledge the privilege that I benefit from in life, in society and in my ability to shoulder the enormous cost of defending myself in a trial like this,” she continued. “My hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard. Therefore, I will be making donations in the near future to multiple organizations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves.""  Outside the courthouse, Baldridge told reporters that he was “delighted” with the jury’s decision.  “It takes wonderful people like Taylor to stand up and draw these lines,” he said.  Mueller, who has denied the claims, filed a $3 million suit against the singer in September 2015, claiming she cost him his job and future career opportunities. Swift countersued Mueller for $1, accusing him of assault and battery.

10141,"The Big Bang Theory star and Spiewak said their ""I dos"" in May at the Rainbow Room in New York City  Jim Parsons Explains Why He and Todd Spiewak Waited Nearly 15 Years to Get Married  Jim Parsons and his husband Todd Spiewak were together for nearly 15 years before they decided to finally tie the knot earlier this year — and according to the Big Bang Theory actor, it was well worth the wait.  The four-time Emmy winning actor stopped by The Late Show with Stephen Colberton Thursday where he explained why they waited so long to get married.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “We just didn’t care about the act of it that much, to be honest with you,” said Parsons, 44. “That sounds cold in a way but I finally thought: ‘Well, let’s have a party then for the celebration and we’ll go ahead and legalize this thing.’ ”  The trip down the aisle ended up being much more special than he had anticipated.  “It was so much more meaningful in the moment for me than I predicted, and it’s been resonantly much more meaningful than for me afterward than I ever saw coming,” he said. “You know, I had been an adult gay person for so long at a time where that wasn’t possible where life was ‘fine’ for me.”  Parsons and Spiewak, a graphic designer, said their “I dos” in May at the Rainbow Room in New York City.  “It was fantastic … much more fun than I thought it would be,” he told Extra days later at the CBS upfront presentation. “I wasn’t too nervous, [it was] just a lot to organize and I thought, ‘Well, this will be sort of fun … Let’s get through this,’ then it was all fun.”  “It was the latest I stayed up in many years,” he added. “I’ll be honest with you — I’m still paying for it. I got a cold, I was at the doctor earlier and got antibiotics.”  FROM PEN: ‘It Was a Fairytale!’ All the Exclusive Details on Tara Lipinski’s Ultra-Chic Southern Wedding  Marriage, it turns out, had changed things for Parsons — who in November will celebrate 15 years with Spiewak.  “I don’t know in a specific day-to-day sense what it is — I don’t know that there is anything. There is an underlying buzz of a thing,” he told Colbert. “And I keep reminding myself of it. Like, I kind of forget and then I’m like, ‘We really did it! We’re a legal thing, just like Mom and Dad were or whatever.’ ”  He went on to describe the sensation he feels being married, one that he equates to a sense of “divinity.”  “To be in love, to find a love in that way, is as close to anything I can imagine doing in life that brings me close to the feeling of God — or whatever that is for you,” he said.  “When we first got together, I remember lying in bed and closing my eyes but not being asleep. And that sensation of ‘light.’ I was like, ‘I don’t know what’s going on exactly, but it’s sort of close to eternal,’ ” Parsons continued. “My dad had passed a couple of years before I met Todd. And I remember very early on that sensation I would have when I closed my eyes and I felt that light, it was like, ‘Oh that’s him.’ He’s going like, ‘Hi, I see. All good. This is a great thing.’ And it both was and it wasn’t, obviously … but I still feel that now. Maybe not as often, because life gets in the way. But sometimes that sensation in closing the eyes and going, ‘This is so close to God.’ ”  While Parsons admitted to Colbert he “didn’t know any other word for it,” Colbert had an answer.  “Love,” the 53-year-old talk show host responded.",real

718,"The #MeToo reckoning is continuing to slowly engulf R. Kelly. In January, Lifetime premiered the documentary series Surviving R. Kelly, an overview of Kelly’s life and career — and of the decades’ worth of accounts that accuse him of having sexually abused young women and children. (Kelly’s lawyer has said the series is full of lies and has threatened to sue.)  In February, Kelly was officially charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse against four victims, at least three of them minors. And in May, Kelly was charged with 11 more counts, including the far more serious charge of aggravated criminal sexual assault.  Now, Kelly faces 18 new counts, including kidnapping and child pornography.  Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 25 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.)  In 2017, he was accused of creating an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly’s hands, including his ex-wife. (Through a lawyer, Kelly has denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”)  Yet despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly’s career marched steadily on. In 2017, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. In 2018, he toured with singer Charlie Wilson (there were some protests). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3.  At Coachella in 2018, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a “child molester” in an interview with Complex. And in our post-#MeToo, post-Time’s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he’s been able to continue working so much. But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella. It’s my first time here.” Later, Staples tweeted that “R. Kelly people is looking for me.”  ladies and gentlemen, vince staples on r kelly pic.twitter.com/SmZdYu9PNJ — andy (@aboynamedandy) April 16, 2018  That stasis appears to be changing. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a 2018 BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes, and then again in Lifetime’s Surviving R. Kelly. And over the past two years, at least five members of Kelly’s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in 2017: “I didn’t know then what I know now,” he said. “He’s a shitbag.”  Last spring, the Women of Color committee within Time’s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly’s record label, RCA. In January, RCA quietly dropped Kelly.  And now, Kelly has been officially charged with more than a dozen counts of sexual abuse and assault.  It’s possible that these latest developments mean that he’s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that’s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him.  And despite everything, it’s still possible that Kelly will continue on with his life and his career as usual. According to the Blast, Kelly’s music saw a 16 percent surge in Spotify streams after Surviving R. Kelly premiered.  There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R. Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he’s been accused of, how often he’s been accused, and how much evidence there is against him. And most likely, that’s because his accusers are overwhelmingly young black women and hence apparently easy for America to ignore.  “The saddest fact I’ve learned is: Nobody matters less to our society than young black women,” says Jim DeRogatis, the reporter who broke the R. Kelly story. “Nobody.”  To try to combat that vagueness and the erasure that it makes possible, here is a timeline of all the accusations of sexual misconduct against R. Kelly.  Much of the chronology below is drawn from DeRogatis’s invaluable reporting on the R. Kelly accusations, including his own immensely thorough timeline. DeRogatis’s timeline covers the entire span of Kelly’s life, including his major career milestones and unrelated legal issues, but I’ve narrowed the focus of this timeline to specifically cover the sexual misconduct accusations against Kelly.  Over the 25-year span of this timeline, a consistent pattern emerges. Over and over again, Kelly is accused of the same behavior: of targeting girls and very young women, isolating them, and controlling and abusing them. And after the dust from the accusation settles, Kelly goes on living his life with very few changes.  Here, from Aaliyah to the alleged sex cult to the charges of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, are all the R. Kelly accusations.  August 30, 1994: 27-year-old R. Kelly marries 15-year-old Aaliyah  The ’90s music sensation Aaliyah was Kelly’s protégé. They met when she was 12 years old, and Kelly wrote and produced her first album in 1993. It was titled Age Ain’t Nothing but a Number. In 1995, Vibe magazine published a copy of their marriage license, with 15-year-old Aaliyah falsely listing her age as 18.  “Family members say Aaliyah thought it was all an elaborate ‘game,’ and she just went along with it,” the Chicago Sun-Times later reported, adding that the marriage license was reportedly obtained by Kelly’s assistant, using a fake ID. “Within hours, she realized what had happened, and she went to her family and sought their help.”  The marriage was annulled in 1994, just months after the ceremony. In the settlement, according to documents obtained by the Sun-Times, Aaliyah promises not to pursue further legal action because of “emotional distress caused by any aspect of her business or personal relationship with Robert” or for “physical injury or emotional pain and suffering arising from any assault or battery perpetrated by Robert against her person.”  1995: Kelly reportedly begins a relationship with underage Lizzette Martinez  In an interview with BuzzFeed published in May 2018, Martinez says she met Kelly at the mall when she was 17, and that he initiated a sexual relationship with her while aware of her age. She also says that he was physically abusive to her and that he pressured her to perform some sexual acts against her will. “It was very controlled: what I wore, how I spoke, who my friends were, who I could bring around,” she says. Kelly has not yet commented on Martinez’s story.  December 24, 1996: the first of the known lawsuits accusing Kelly of sex with underage girls is filed  Tiffany Hawkins filed suit against Kelly and his record, publishing, and management companies on Christmas Eve 1996. The suit alleged that he initiated a sexual relationship with her when she was when he was 24 and she was 15, and that he pushed her to participate in group sex with him and other underage girls. Kelly allegedly met Hawkins at his old Chicago high school, Kenwood Academy, when he visited the school to reminisce about having gotten his start there and to inspire current students to follow their dreams.  Hawkins sought $10 million in damages, but Kelly countersued, claiming that Hawkins was attempting to blackmail him with a false paternity claim. (There is no paternity claim in Hawkins’s lawsuit.) Hawkins settled for $250,000, and her suit went largely unnoticed until 2000, when DeRogatis began to investigate the R. Kelly case for the Chicago Sun-Times.  December 21, 2000: the Chicago Sun-Times publishes the first newspaper article investigating Kelly’s alleged sex crimes  In a lengthy and thoroughly reported story, the Chicago Sun-Times outlined the facts of the Tiffany Hawkins lawsuit and Kelly’s marriage to Aaliyah. “Chicago police twice have investigated allegations that Kelly was having sex with an underage female but dropped the investigations because the girl would not cooperate,” the story noted. No one from Kelly’s camp provided comment for the article.  January 2001: the first R. Kelly sex tape emerges  An anonymous source sent a videotape of what appeared to be Kelly having sex with a very young woman to Jim DeRogatis at the Sun-Times. DeRogatis handed the tape over to the Chicago police, but the police, unable to identify the woman in the tape, did not charge Kelly. Bootleg copies of the tape circulated throughout Chicago. As far as we can tell, Kelly has not publicly commented on this tape.  August 2001: the second R. Kelly lawsuit is filed  Tracy Sampson, a former intern at Epic Records, filed a lawsuit against Kelly claiming that he initiated a sexual relationship with her when she was 17. DeRogatis quotes at length from her lawsuit:  I was lied to by him. … I was coerced into receiving oral sex from a girl I did not want to have sex with. I was often treated as his personal sex object and cast aside. He would tell me to come to his studio and have sex with him, then tell me to go. He often tried to control every aspect of my life including who I would see and where I would go.  The suit was settled out of court. The size of the settlement is unknown. Kelly denied all wrongdoing.  February 8, 2002: the second R. Kelly tape emerges  An anonymous source sent another videotape to the Chicago Police Department, this one showing Kelly engaging in sex acts with and urinating on what appears to be a young girl while instructing her to call him “Daddy.” A witness identified the girl and said she would have been 14 at the time the videotape was made.  Kelly, who was scheduled to perform at the Winter Olympics the same month that the tape emerged, denied in a radio interview that the tape showed him having sex with a minor. “It’s crap, and that’s how we’re going to treat it,” he said. “The reason these things are happening I really do believe is because of the fact that I didn’t fall back as far as blackmail was concerned. I didn’t give them any money.”  Bootleg copies of the tape circulated across the country, and police eventually indicted Kelly on 21 counts of child pornography.  April 29, 2002: Kelly is sued by a third woman …  Patrice Jones said in her lawsuit that Kelly had sex with her when she was 16 years old, and that when she became pregnant, he coerced her into having an abortion. Kelly settled the lawsuit out of court for an unknown sum. His lawyer described the suit as “a collection of half-truths, distortions and outright lies.”  May 4, 2002: … and a fourth  Thirty-three-year-old Montina Woods said that Kelly taped their sexual encounter without her knowledge and then distributed the tapes. Kelly, once again, settled out of court for an unknown sum. A spokesperson from his camp described the suit as “ridiculous” and “nonsensical.”  2005: Kelly’s second wife, Andrea Lee, files a restraining order against him alleging abuse  Kelly married dancer Drea Kelly, née Andrea Lee, in 1996. In 2005, she petitioned for and received an emergency restraining order against him, citing physical abuse, harassment, stalking, and interfering with her personal liberty.  In her petition, Drea wrote that when she asked for a divorce, Kelly pinned her down and hit her repeatedly, yelling, “Don’t you leave me! Why are you leaving me?” She added that he repeatedly “snapped” at her when she was near a man, including the time a man showed up in the background of a picture she took with her kids.  “My wife and I had a heated argument, and we are now in the process of working it out,” Kelly said in a public statement. “We hope that the press and public will give us the time and privacy we need to resolve this very personal situation.”  Once the emergency order expired, Drea asked for it to be dismissed, and she refused to comment on the incident in the press, referring to it only as “old news.”  October 4, 2006: Kelly is sued by his mentor and associate  Longtime Kelly associate Henry “Love” Vaughn said in a lawsuit that Kelly attacked him at a party at his house, and backed out of paying Vaughan for his work on a song as well. In an interview with the Sun-Times, Vaughn claimed Kelly attacked him after he remarked that Kelly’s 7-year-old daughter was dancing “grown-up style,” saying, “She was all dressed up with tight jeans and makeup on, a seven-year-old girl, dancing on top of the pool table. It was ridiculous. She told my lady, ‘I’m having a show next week; when you come, bring $100.’”  Kelly’s lawyer once again described the lawsuit as “a pathetic collection of half-truths, distortions and outright lies.”  May 2008: the trial of R. Kelly  More than five years after the news of the alleged child sex tape broke, Kelly faced trial on 14 counts of child pornography. (In the years since he was indicted, Kelly’s lawyers had successfully knocked out seven of the original charges.) The trial lasted for just over a month, and neither Kelly nor the girl on the tape testified. Although 15 witnesses for the prosecution took the stand to identify the girl in question, the jury concluded that they could not be positive of the girl’s identity and thus could not be sure that she was underage. After one day of deliberations, the jury found Kelly not guilty. Kelly broke down in tears in the courtroom.  After the trial, Kelly spent nearly 10 years tending to his career, headlining musical festivals and staying away from scandal. And then …  July 2017: news of the alleged sex cult breaks  Last summer, BuzzFeed News reported that R. Kelly was allegedly holding multiple young women in compounds on his properties across the country, controlling their every move. According to BuzzFeed’s sources, the women were required to call Kelly “Daddy”; ask his permission before going anywhere, including the bathroom; wear jogging suits so that other men could not see their bodies; and turn and face the wall when other men entered the room. BuzzFeed further reported that Kelly allegedly coerced the women into group sex, videotaped them, and beat them when they disobeyed him.  But the women currently living with Kelly have repeatedly said that they are happy and that they are with him of their own free will. And because they are all 18 or older, police have not intervened.  Through a lawyer, Kelly issued a statement denying the BuzzFeed report. “Mr. Robert Kelly is both alarmed and disturbed at the recent revelations attributed to him,” the statement reads. “Mr. Kelly unequivocally denies such allegations and will work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”  August 2017: one of R. Kelly’s accusers breaks her nondisclosure agreement to speak out  Jerhonda Pace says she began a relationship with Kelly in 2009, when she was 16, and that the details of their relationship match the details reported about Kelly’s alleged “sex cult”: At first Kelly courted her, she said, and then he isolated her, and then he began to abuse her. After their relationship ended, she sued Kelly for damages, and says he settled with her out of court in exchange for her signing an NDA. Pace said she decided to break the terms of her settlement last summer in order to help the women still with Kelly. “If I can speak out and I can help them get out of that situation, that’s what I will do,” she said.  A representative for Kelly denied the accusations, saying, “The allegations against Mr. Kelly are false, and are being made by individuals known to be dishonest. It is clear these continuing stories are the result of the effort of those with personal agendas who are working in concert to interfere with and damage his career. Mr. Kelly again denies any and all wrongdoing and is taking appropriate legal action to protect himself from ongoing defamation.”  October 2017: another Kelly accuser backs up the sex cult story  Kitti Jones says her relationship with Kelly also mirrors the accounts of the sex cult story. Kelly got her to quit her job and move in with him, Jones said last October, and then he began to control her, and then he began to abuse her. Kelly denied all the accusations.  April 9, 2018: an unnamed woman files a criminal complaint against Kelly  An unnamed woman says she spent eight months in a relationship with Kelly when she was 19, and that he was grooming her to join his sex cult, the Huffington Post reports. According to the woman’s lawyer, at one point Kelly told her that “she would have to sign a contract and offer collateral information about herself and her family for Kelly’s protection.”  The woman says Kelly intentionally infected her with an STD over the course of their relationship. She’s filed a criminal complaint against him, citing charges of “unlawful restraint, furnishing alcohol and illegal drugs to a minor, and aggravated assault (via the referenced intentional STD infection).” Her lawyer says she is preparing a federal civil lawsuit against Kelly. Kelly has denied the accusations.  November 20, 2018: Kelly’s ex-wife Drea Kelly accuses R. Kelly of domestic violence  Kelly and his second wife Drea Kelly (née Andrea Lee) divorced in 2009, but rumors have long flourished that dark secrets lurked in their marriage.  In 2003, Drea’s mother Gerri Cruz told journalists that she feared that R. Kelly was brainwashing her daughter. “The last time I talked to her was over two years ago on the phone,” Cruz said. “She was crying hysterically and violently.”  Cruz said she asked the police to check out Kelly’s house to make sure that Drea was all right, but nothing came of it.  “I don’t know if my child is under the influence. I don’t know if she is being controlled. I don’t know if people are watching her. I don’t know if she is being brainwashed,” Cruz said.  Drea denied that she was being kept away from her family. “We live right here in Chicago. How could you not know where I am? It’s not as if I am overseas,” she said in an interview with Essence in 2009.  Earlier reports in the Chicago Sun-Times said that Kelly’s associates referred to Drea as “Puppydog,” and that she was “required” to knock before entering a room in the couple’s shared house.  In November 2018, Drea spoke out publicly for the first time about the abuse she says she has experienced at Kelly’s hands. She told ABC News that Kelly emotionally, physically, and sexually abused her, and that when they were married, she thought he might kill her. She says she decided to come forward after stories of Kelly’s alleged sex cult began to emerge.  “All these allegations start comin’ out again and I’m like, ‘God, OK. I don’t think I can take this one,’” she said.  Kelly’s representatives declined to comment on Drea’s statements.  January 3, 2019: Surviving R. Kelly premieres on Lifetime  Lifetime’s Surviving R. Kelly consists of three two-hour installments. The first is focused on Kelly’s childhood and early music career — and the sexual abuse he suffered. The second is focused on his 2008 criminal trial. The third is focused on the 2017 “sex cult” story. While the series mostly reiterates information that was already on the record, it does include accounts from multiple members of Kelly’s inner circle who are speaking out in public for the first time, and its arrival was marked by outrage.  In December 2018, a private screening of the docuseries was evacuated and then canceled following a gun threat. “The first thing that came to my mind — and I can’t speak for anyone else — was that [R. Kelly] had this shut down,” Drea Kelly told Rolling Stone after the evacuation. “I believe it was somebody connected to him.” And on the day of the premiere, TMZ published a letter from Kelly’s lawyer threatening to sue Lifetime over the series.  February 14, 2019: a third sex tape emerges  Both the New Yorker and CNN reported that law enforcement officials in Illinois had received a copy of a tape that appeared to show Kelly engaging in sex acts with a 14-year-old girl.  February 22, 2019: Kelly is charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse  Prosecutors in Cook County, Illinois filed 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse against Kelly. He was arraigned in March.  May 30, 2019: Kelly is charged with 11 additional counts, including aggravated criminal sexual assault  Three months after filing 10 charges against Kelly, Cook County, Illinois filed an additional 11 charges against him. The new charges include aggravated criminal sexual assault, which is considered more serious than the sexual abuse with which Kelly was previously charged and which can be punished by up to 30 years in prison.  July 11 – 12, 2019: Kelly faces 18 new counts, including kidnapping and child pornography  Cook County, Illinois filed an additional 13 charges against Kelly on July 11, including charges of child pornography. The following day, he received five additional federal sex crime charges, including charges of kidnapping and forced labor in New York.  The sheer volume of accusations Kelly has fielded since 1994 is astonishing, and perhaps it offers its own answer as to why he’s been able to live his life with few consequences. In a sense, his fans have been inoculated. They’ve been listening to accusations against Kelly for 25 years, and they’ve been listening to Kelly maintain his innocence for just as long. In 2019, ignoring the persistent allegations against Kelly is just part of being an R. Kelly fan.  This article was originally published in April 2018.

683,"Getty  According to the bombshell report, the final straw was an ugly fight that erupted after Kanye's recent off-the-wall tweets, including support of Donald Trump and referring to slavery as a 'choice'.  'She called him out on his selfishness and how he doesn't ever think of the repercussions it could have for her brands,' an insider explosively tells. 'All he cares about is his music and clothing line.'  'It was one of their worst fights ever.'  The source outrageously adds that Kim is petrified to divorce a third time and potentially fight with Kanye over their shared $300 million fortune, but her desire to get out 'is greater than' her fear.  'Kim wants her old life back,' a source said.  In Touch  In Touch further claims that Kim has had enough of Kanye's erratic behaviour.  'Kim is a nervous wreck because she never knows what's around the corner when it comes to his actions,' a Kardashian insider said.  'She just can't take it anymore and stays at Kris' house with the kids.'  The couple share three children - North, 5, Saint, 2, and Chicago, 8-months.  Kim knows the pain and humiliation of a public divorce all to well, still haunted by her 2011 divorce to NBA player Kris Humphries, which dragged on for nearly eight times the length of their 72-day marriage.

5709,"Michael Bublé has officially retired from music following his son Noah's cancer battle.  The singer, 43, explained that the heartache he endured following son's cancer diagnosis at just three years old has changed his 'perception of life' and he is now done with fame.  Noah, now five, is currently in remission following his battle with liver cancer, but the ordeal has been life-changing for Bublé, who has since questioned his career in showbusiness.  Michael Bublé reveals he has decided to quit the music industry following his son's battle with cancer  Michael is married to Argentinian actress Luisana Lopilato, 31, and they share three children together; their eldest son Noah, son Elias, two, and daughter Vida, whom they welcomed two months ago.  Both he and Luisana put their careers on hold to be there for their son - they jetted to the US so Noah could undergo treatment for hepatoblastoma.  The singer recalled how he used to make the 'best of the situation' during his hospital visits with Noah and tried to make it fun for his little boy.  Noah (pictured) now five, is currently in remission but Bublé says the ordeal has been life changing  With a new album, titled Love, on the way, he explained that this is his time to step away from music, wanting to leave at the 'very top' after making the 'perfect record'.  Michael revealed his decision to quit the industry in what he claimed to be his 'last interview' with Daily Mail's Weekend magazine...  'My whole being’s changed since my son got cancer': Michael Bublé says he was embarrassed to realise just how egotistical he’d become as he nursed his boy Noah back to health - but now he's got his mojo back  By Chrissy Iley for Weekend Magazine  Michael Bublé knows better than most that fate does not stand aside and wave the famous through.  The Canadian singer has won four Grammys and sold 75 million records, earning him some £35 million a year.  Bublé opened up about the turmoil he and his family went through after his son Noah (pictured together) was diagnosed with liver cancer two years ago  He’s been married to stunning Argentinian model and actress Luisana Lopilato for seven years, and the couple live a life of luxury with their three children, sons Noah, five, and Elias, two, and daughter Vida Amber Betty, who’s just 11 weeks old.  Yet all of this seemed meaningless when Noah was diagnosed with liver cancer two years ago, and the devastated couple immediately announced they were putting their careers on hold to care for their son.  Noah has now been declared cancer-free and today Michael is looking suave and slim when we meet in his London hotel suite. He has a new album out, Love – but it’s one that he admits now might never have been made.  He’s very emotional. His brown eyes well up at the mere mention of the C word, and it’s clear he’s still living in the shadow of what he describes as two years of hell.  ‘You just want to die,’ he says. ‘I don’t even know how I was breathing.  'My wife was the same and even though I was the stronger of the two of us, I wasn’t strong. My wife was... I’m sorry, I can’t make it to the end of the sentence... let’s just say we find out who we are with these things.  Michael admits that he likes to be in control and doesn’t feel comfortable crying. His son Noah has now received the all-clear  'Going through this with Noah, I didn’t question who I was, I just questioned everything else. Why are we here?  'Is this all there is? Because if this is all there is, there has to be something bigger.’  He says that one way he got through it was to pretend he was Roberto Benigni’s character from Life Is Beautiful. The 1997 film was set in a concentration camp and the way Benigni’s character, Guido, and his son coped was to make a joke of everything.  ‘I don’t know if that was a choice, but that’s who I became,’ he says. ‘For instance, I never called it the hospital, I called it the fun hotel.  The singer revealed the impact it had on him and his wife of seven years, the stunning Argentinian model and actress Luisana Lopilato (pictured together). He said that his wife took it even harder than he did  'And every day I got extra bedsheets and I’d build a tent for Noah. I just made the best of it. Survival.  ‘It’s been such a difficult exercise. It hurts me, and it hurts to talk about Noah because it’s not my story to tell, it’s his.  'But my whole being’s changed. My perception of life. I don’t know if I can even get through this conversation without crying. And I’ve never lost control of my emotions in public.’  Michael likes to be in control and doesn’t feel comfortable crying. His heroes are the macho singers of the 50s and 60s like Frank Sinatra and Bobby Darin.  As a teenager he’d take his bible to bed, praying that one day he’d emulate them. ‘In a weird way talking about it is therapy for me,’ he says.  ‘I actually thought I’d never come back to the music business. I never fell out of love with music, I just needed to put it aside.  'What was hard was going to the store to buy hot dogs and toilet paper, going to the gas station. Going for a walk by the sea to clear my head.  'Everyone recognises me and says, “How’s your son?” When you think you’re close to getting over it you’re sucked right back into it. But at the same time I was given faith in humanity.  Michael admitted that his son's illness made him realise he needed to make a change in his life. He said: 'When this terrible news came in I realised I wasn’t having fun in the music business'. Pictured: Michael and Noah in Spain before his diagnosis  'The media helped me, they weren’t disrespectful. And in those two years my record company never asked me what the plan was. They said, “We love you and we’re praying for you.”’  I was all set to interview Michael not long after Noah was diagnosed, as he was due to host the 2017 Brit Awards, but the interview was cancelled when he pulled out. ‘I had no interest in my career and I’m grateful I could afford to take time out,’ he says.  ‘I spent a good deal of time with people who weren’t so lucky. When this terrible news came in I realised I wasn’t having fun in the music business.  'I’d lost the joy and at some point just before the Brits I was starting to lose the plot. I’d become desperate to hold onto something I thought I might be losing, and I thought I had to do something special to keep it.  'I’d started to do things out of my comfort zone, like presenting, and the truth is it had been a while since I’d been having fun. I’d started to worry about ticket sales for my tours, what the critics said, what the perception of me might be.’  He grabs the net voile from behind the curtain and puts it over his face. ‘I felt like I was living with this over my face and the reality I was seeing was blurred by it.  I decided I’d never read my name again in print, never read a review, and I never have. I decided I’d never use social media again, and I never have  'But the diagnosis made me realise how stupid I’d been to worry about these unimportant things. I was embarrassed by my ego, that it had allowed this insecurity.  'And I decided I’d never read my name again in print, never read a review, and I never have. I decided I’d never use social media again, and I never have.  ‘I realised that for many years I couldn’t believe I was on the same stage as my heroes, that I was sharing a microphone with Tony Bennett or [Canadian pianist and singer] Diana Krall. I couldn’t believe I was looking across at someone like Paul McCartney, and I’d be saying things like, “It’s hard to get here, but my God it’s harder to stay here.”  'But then I woke up and thought, “After ten years of trying to get here and five years of being scared it would go away, I think I can enjoy it.”’  It seems that his son’s illness ignited this realisation that he’d become fixated on his own success. ‘I don’t have the stomach for it any more,’ he says.  ‘The celebrity narcissism. I started to crumble. But then I started to wonder why I wanted to do this in the first place.  'I’d forgotten that it’s about souls connecting, because I’d become so anxious. There were people in my business life saying, “If you hadn’t done this or that, or you’d written a better song, tickets might be selling quicker.”  'I started to take all that on board. No one wanted to take any responsibility.  'It was much easier for people to pass the buck to me because I was insecure enough already. I would digest it and say, “It’s my fault. I’m absolutely rubbish.”  'It affected me and I started to think, “It’s all going to go. I’m going to lose everything.”  ‘I was insecure. I’d been learning from my heroes for so many years, but even though I was learning with passion I was afraid I’d become a mere poor-quality photocopy of my heroes.  'But when I came back from this terrible time I realised I’m not a mere photocopy. I’ve learned everything I can from them, taken it and found it in my own soul, my own voice, my own style and now no critic can take that away.  'It needed clarifying. Now I’m just singing the music I love. Maybe when you let go, maybe that’s when it comes back to you. Like love.’  Michael is overjoyed that he has a family of five now. Everything changed for him when his three-year relationship with his former girlfriend, the Golden Globe-nominated Devil Wears Prada actress Emily Blunt, fell apart.  Everything changed for him when his three-year relationship with his former girlfriend, the Golden Globe-nominated Devil Wears Prada actress Emily Blunt, fell apart  He blamed himself for the break-up and went into therapy. He bought self-help books, readdressed his eating habits (he has a tendency to put on weight if he isn’t careful) and started going to the gym.  He was still getting over Emily when he spotted Luisana after performing a show in Buenos Aires.  They met again at a party and he told her, ‘You’re my wife, you just don’t know it yet. I’m going to come back and marry you.’  A year went by with them exchanging emails, and as he told me when we last met in 2011, ‘I was mad crazy for her. I went and asked her father’s permission to marry her and we had a big, beautiful wedding.’  When he learned Noah was in remission, the joy returned to Michael’s world. Is that when the urge to make music again hit him?  ‘The two are inextricably linked, yet it wasn’t as straightforward as, “My son’s recovered, I should make an album,”’ he explains. ‘I’d told my manager I wanted to take a ten-year sabbatical, so I could hang out and be bad.  After that a year went by with them exchanging emails, and he said he was 'mad crazy for her'. Eventually, he asked her father for permission to marry her and they had a big wedding. Pictured are the couple in April 2018  'But I missed the guys in my band. So once when Luisana had to go back to Argentina I said to them, “Come over to the house, let’s drink, order pizza, play video games and jam.”  They came over, we partied and we said, “Let’s play some music.” I thought, “Wow! This is fun.”’  He takes out his phone and shows me videos of his friends jamming in his house, playing the various songs that ended up being the new album. ‘It was then that I realised I’d missed making music. I didn’t even know I’d missed it. This was about a year ago.’  He’s starting to perk up now, and when his spirits lift he laughs easily and likes to make everyone around him laugh. As we chat he flits between accents – we go from Liverpool to Texas via India and South Africa, and finally to his version of a London accent, which he says he loves.  It was then that I realised I’d missed making music. I didn’t even know I’d missed it. This was about a year ago  He’s been working with James Corden on a Carpool Karaoke special for the Stand Up To Cancer fundraising campaign and likes the way Corden speaks. ‘We watch The Gruffalo movie about five times a day because my kids love it, and James Corden is the voice of the little brown mouse, so he’s in my house “all the day”, as my little boy would say.’  He pauses. ‘There are three reasons I wanted to do this album,’ he says.  ‘One, because I felt a debt of gratitude, deeper than I can explain, to the millions of people all over the world who prayed for us and showed us compassion. That gave me faith in humanity.  'Two, because I love music and feel I can continue the legacy of my idols. And three, because if the world was ending – not just my own personal hell but watching the political turmoil in America and watching Europe break up – there’s never a better time for music.’  Then suddenly he stops. ‘This is my last interview,’ he says quite solemnly. ‘I’m retiring from the business. I’ve made the perfect record and now I can leave at the very top.’  Somehow, though, I don’t think he really means it.  Michael’s album Love will be released on 16 November.

4424,"Christina Aguilera is one of the best vocalists in the pop music industry, but her record breaking success has been tainted by her tumultuous personal life. Her two and a half year relationship with Matthew Rutler appears to be solid and happy, but Star magazine claims that this is only smoke and mirrors. A source reveals, “Their relationship is convenient. It was always casual, very on and off, and not something Christina saw a future in.” The magazine further alleges that Aguilera is “ready for a new man” and that she’s “already on the prowl for a replacement.”  Aguilera’s temporary departure from The Voice signaled a massive change in her career. Not only did she regain the humungous success she once had, but she also built a completely new fan base from scratch. Aguilera has also been steadfast in her romantic affairs, but there’s still an opportunity for artistic ambition to give her relationship with Rutler a death blow.  This is, however, highly unlikely.  The source continues, “Christina plans on being ‘officially’ single by the time she begins promoting her new album and tour. She’s wasting no time setting her sights on a number of eligible bachelors. [She] wants an A-list boyfriend to complement her newfound confidence. All that’s missing is a hot, headline-stealing man on her arm. She’s already compiled a wish list that includes Colin Farrell and Jared Leto.”  Aguilera’s pop ballads speak of heartache and forlorn memories, so we doubt she’d put this spell on Rutler, especially since they’ve been dating for as long as Taylor Swift’s career.  It’s up to you to decide whether there’s any veracity to this story. What do you think? Do you think Aguilera is about to kick Rutler to the curb and headhunt a hot one?

Ben Affleck, 45, and Jennifer Garner, 45, broke the hearts of fans everywhere when they split in 2015. Despite some hoping they’d work it out, the two filed for divorce in April 2017. Supposedly, Ben wasn’t ready to let go, as Us Weekly reports that since they filed the papers, “he’s begged her to come back several times, but she has no interest.” Though Ben has moved on to date Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus, 37, he was reportedly, at one point, telling friends he wanted his ex back.  Despite two years of trying to fix things – Jennifer “put her heart and soul into fixing the relationship and so desperately wanted to turn things around for the children’s sake, as well as theirs,” a fiend told Us – it was all in vain. Supposedly, there was a hopeful moment in 2017. After Jennifer reportedly helped Ben during his stint in rehab for alcohol abuse, a source claims he said, “He didn’t want to live without her. Things looked positive…they both wanted it to work. Though some observers thought “it was like they were together again,” it just wasn’t meant to be, and the couple went ahead with the divorce filing.  Despite this report, people shouldn’t get too excited for a happy reunion. “There is no truth here,” a source close to the exes EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com about this report. Though the source denied Ben’s “begging,” the insiders said that Ben and Jennifer “have much love and admiration for each other.”  Even Us Weekly’s report claims that Ben’s cries were falling on deaf ears. “She forgave him for such much and still he couldn’t change,” a source tells Us. “She feels it’s important to keep the peace and be a family unit,” but when it comes to romance, “she’s not going there at all.” She and Ben will still spend time together, but it will be only for the benefit of their children. “She just wants her kids to heave a healthy, happy and engaged father – and she’ll do whatever it takes to make that happen.”  [  While Ben has moved on to Lindsey, what about Jen? She’s reportedly been on a few dates – one with an “Affleck look-alike.” Jennifer is “ready to go with her feelings and give love another try. It’s no exaggeration to say that Ben broke her heart and left her in a terrible place emotionally, [but] it’s been almost three years since they called it quits. It’s time for her to move on.”",fake

In an interview with The Daily Mail, Ramsay shared how his wife, Tana, was his biggest source of motivation for losing weight because she has always been a fitness enthusiast and let him know she wasn't pleased with his weight gain, according to People.  ""Tana was not impressed with the way I was,"" Ramsay revealed. ""I was overweight, 18 stone [over 250 pounds]. I looked like a sack of s--t. I look at the pictures and think, 'How did Tana stay around?' Because Tana has got better-looking and more gorgeous. And there she is, getting in bed with a fat f--k.""  Getty Images  Gordon and Tana have been married for over 20 years and have four children together, and at the time of his weight gain, he had just won his third Michelin star. But despite those accomplishments, Ramsay said he still suffered from low self-esteem.  ""It was painful,"" he said. ""I used to look at myself in the mirror and think, 'Holy s--t!' So it was a big wake-up call.""  The chef attributed his weight gain to not eating properly when working long hours and during vacation trips with David and Victoria Beckham and their respective families.

""I started focusing on getting super-fit five or six years ago when my life got super-busy,"" he told The Daily Mail. ""You get consumed by the work. You get sucked up. You get drawn in. All of a sudden your 'me time' is zero. There was no breathing space, no down time, no time to even think straight. It all started hitting me hard. I didn't panic, but my head was not in the game.""

828,"""Jolie"" redirects here. For other uses, see Jolie (disambiguation)  American actress  Angelina Jolie ( ; (born Angelina Jolie Voight; June 4, 1975[3]), is an American actress, filmmaker, and humanitarian. The recipient of numerous accolades, including an Academy Award and three Golden Globe Awards, she has been named Hollywood's highest-paid actress multiple times.  Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982), and her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999). Her starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with the war dramas In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), and First They Killed My Father (2017).  In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and made an honorary Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).  As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life, including her relationships, marriages, and health battles, has been the subject of wide publicity. She is divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller, Billy Bob Thornton, and Brad Pitt; she and Pitt have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally.  Early life and family  Born Angelina Jolie Voight in Los Angeles, California, she is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[4] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[5] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[6] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[7][8] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[7] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[9] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[7][10]  After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[11] Her mother raised her Catholic but did not require her to go to church.[12] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[13] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[14] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[15] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[11] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.  Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[13] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[16][17] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[16] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[13] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[14] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[18] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[11][16] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[19]  As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[20] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[21] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[18] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[22] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[14] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[14] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[23]  Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[24] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[25] They reconciled when they appeared together in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated.[11] Jolie petitioned the court to legally remove her surname ""Voight"" in favor of her middle name, which she had long used as a stage name; the name change was granted on September 12, 2002.[26] Voight then went public with their estrangement during an appearance on Access Hollywood, in which he claimed Jolie had ""serious mental problems.""[27] At that point, her mother and brother also broke off contact with Voight.[28] They did not speak for six and a half years,[29] but began rebuilding their relationship in the wake of Bertrand's death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007,[28][30] before going public with their reconciliation three years later.[28]  Career  1991–1997: Early work  Jolie committed to acting professionally at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that her demeanor was ""too dark.""[14] She appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the USC School of Cinema-Television, as well as in several music videos, namely Lenny Kravitz's ""Stand by My Woman"" (1991), Antonello Venditti's ""Alta Marea"" (1991), The Lemonheads's ""It's About Time"" (1993), and Meat Loaf's ""Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through"" (1993). She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both ""drama queens.""[13]  Jolie began her professional film career in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the straight-to-video science-fiction sequel Cyborg 2, as a near-human robot designed for corporate espionage and assassination. She was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year.[14] Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence (1995), she starred in her first Hollywood picture, Hackers (1995). The New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote, ""Kate stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top.""[31] Hackers failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.[32]  After starring in the modern-day Romeo and Juliet adaptation Love Is All There Is (1996), Jolie appeared in the road movie Mojave Moon (1996), of which The Hollywood Reporter said, ""Jolie, an actress whom the camera truly adores, reveals a comic flair and the kind of blatant sexuality that makes it entirely credible that Danny Aiello's character would drop everything just for the chance of being with her.""[33] In Foxfire (1996) she played a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them. Jack Mathews of the Los Angeles Times wrote of her performance, ""It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst.""[34]  In 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, set in the Los Angeles underworld. The film was not well received by critics; Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert noted that Jolie ""finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be [a mobster's] girlfriend, and maybe she is.""[35] Her next work, as a frontierswoman in the CBS miniseries True Women (1997), was even less successful; writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Robert Strauss dismissed her as ""horrid, a fourth-rate Scarlett O'Hara"" who relies on ""gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips.""[36] Jolie also starred in the music video for the Rolling Stones's ""Anybody Seen My Baby?"" as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City.[37]  1998–2000: Breakthrough  Jolie's career prospects began to improve after she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT's George Wallace (1997), about the life of the segregationist Alabama Governor and presidential candidate George Wallace, played by Gary Sinise. Jolie portrayed Wallace's second wife, Cornelia, a performance Lee Winfrey of The Philadelphia Inquirer considered a highlight of the film.[38] George Wallace was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film. Jolie also received a nomination for an Emmy Award for her performance.  Jolie's first breakthrough came when she portrayed supermodel Gia Carangi in HBO's Gia (1998). The film chronicles the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin, and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s. Vanessa Vance of Reel.com retrospectively noted, ""Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayal—filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation—and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed.""[39] For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award. She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award.  In accordance with Lee Strasberg's method acting, Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting Gia, she told her husband, Jonny Lee Miller, that she would not be able to phone him: ""I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'""[40] After Gia wrapped, she briefly gave up acting, because she felt that she had ""nothing else to give.""[14] She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she took night classes at New York University to study directing and screenwriting.[11] Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia, Jolie resumed her career.[14]  Following the previously filmed gangster film Hell's Kitchen (1998), Jolie returned to the screen in Playing by Heart (1998), part of an ensemble cast that included Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson, and Ryan Phillippe. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Jolie was praised in particular; San Francisco Chronicle critic Peter Stack wrote, ""Jolie, working through an overwritten part, is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she's willing to gamble.""[41] She won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the National Board of Review.  In 1999, Jolie starred in the comedy-drama Pushing Tin, alongside John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett. The film met with mixed reception from critics, and Jolie's character—Thornton's seductive wife—was particularly criticized; writing for The Washington Post, Desson Howe dismissed her as ""a completely ludicrous writer's creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home.""[42] Jolie then co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Bone Collector (1999), playing a police officer who reluctantly helps Washington's quadriplegic detective track down a serial killer. The film grossed $151.5 million worldwide,[43] but was critically unsuccessful. Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press concluded, ""Jolie, while always delicious to look at, is simply and woefully miscast.""[44]  ""Jolie is emerging as one of the great wild spirits of current movies, a loose cannon who somehow has deadly aim."" —Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert on Jolie's performance in Girl, Interrupted (1999)[45]  Jolie next took the supporting role of a sociopathic mental patient in Girl, Interrupted (1999), an adaptation of Susanna Kaysen's memoir of the same name. While Winona Ryder played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, the film instead marked Jolie's final breakthrough in Hollywood.[46] She won her third Golden Globe Award, her second Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. For Variety, Emanuel Levy noted, ""Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant, irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susanna's rehabilitation.""[47]  In 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster, Gone in 60 Seconds, which became her highest-grossing film to that point, earning $237.2 million internationally.[43] She had a minor role as the mechanic ex-girlfriend of a car thief played by Nicolas Cage; The Washington Post writer Stephen Hunter criticized that ""all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth.""[48] Jolie later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after her emotionally demanding role in Girl, Interrupted.  2001–2004: Mainstream recognition  Although highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie had rarely found films that appealed to a wide audience, but Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) made her an international superstar. An adaptation of the popular Tomb Raider videogames, the film required her to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft. Although the film generated mostly negative reviews, Jolie was generally praised for her physical performance; Newsday's John Anderson commented, ""Jolie makes the title character a virtual icon of female competence and coolth.""[49] The film was an international hit, earning $274.7 million worldwide,[43] and launched her global reputation as a female action star.  Alexander in December 2004 Jolie at the Cologne premiere ofin December 2004  Jolie next starred opposite Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in Original Sin (2001), the first of a string of films that were poorly received by critics and audiences alike. The New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell questioned Jolie's decision to follow her Oscar-winning performance with ""soft-core nonsense.""[50] The romantic comedy Life or Something Like It (2002), though equally unsuccessful, marked an unusual choice for Jolie. Salon's Allen Barra considered her ambitious newscaster character a rare attempt at playing a conventional women's role, noting that her performance ""doesn't get off the ground until a scene where she goes punk and leads a group of striking bus workers in singing 'Satisfaction'"".[51] Despite her lack of box office success, Jolie remained in demand as an actress;[19] in 2002, she established herself among Hollywood's highest-paid actresses, earning $10–$15 million per film for the next five years.[52]  Jolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life (2003), which was not as lucrative as the original, earning $156.5 million at the international box office.[43] She also starred in the music video for Korn's ""Did My Time"", which was used to promote the sequel. Her next film was Beyond Borders (2003), in which she portrayed a socialite who joins an aid worker played by Clive Owen. Though unsuccessful with audiences, the film stands as the first of several passion projects Jolie has made to bring attention to humanitarian causes.[53] Beyond Borders was a critical failure; Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times acknowledged Jolie's ability to ""bring electricity and believability to roles,"" but wrote that ""the limbo of a hybrid character, a badly written cardboard person in a fly-infested, blood-and-guts world, completely defeats her.""[54]  The year 2004 saw the release of four films featuring Jolie. She first starred in the thriller Taking Lives as an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The film received mixed reviews; The Hollywood Reporter critic Kirk Honeycutt concluded, ""Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour.""[55] Jolie made a brief appearance as a fighter pilot in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, a science fiction adventure shot entirely with actors in front of a bluescreen, and voiced her first family film, the DreamWorks animation Shark Tale. Her supporting role as Queen Olympias in Oliver Stone's Alexander, about the life of Alexander the Great, was met with mixed reception, particularly concerning her Slavic accent.[51] Commercially, the film failed in North America, which Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality,[56] but it succeeded internationally, for a total revenue of $167.3 million.[43]  2005–2010: Commercial success  In 2005, Jolie returned to major box office success with the action-comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which she starred opposite Brad Pitt as a bored married couple who find out that they are both secret assassins. The film received mixed reviews, but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads; Star Tribune critic Colin Covert noted, ""While the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry.""[57] With box office takings of $478.2 million worldwide, Mr. & Mrs. Smith was the seventh-highest grossing picture of the year and remained Jolie's highest-grossing live-action film for the next decade.[43][58]  Following a supporting role as the neglected wife of a CIA officer in Robert De Niro's The Good Shepherd (2006), Jolie starred as Mariane Pearl in the documentary-style drama A Mighty Heart (2007). Based on Pearl's memoir of the same name, the film chronicles the kidnapping and murder of her husband, The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, in Pakistan. Although the biracial Pearl had personally chosen Jolie for the role,[59] the casting drew racial criticism and accusations of blackface.[60] The resulting performance was widely praised; Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter described it as ""well-measured and moving,"" played ""with respect and a firm grasp on a difficult accent.""[61] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Jolie also played a shape-shifting seductress, Grendel's mother, in the epic Beowulf (2007), created through motion capture. The film was critically and commercially well received, taking in revenues of $196.4 million worldwide.[43]  By 2008, Jolie was considered the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, earning $15–$20 million per film.[62][63] While other actresses had been forced to take salary cuts in recent years, Jolie's perceived box office appeal allowed her to command as much as $20 million plus a percentage.[64] She starred alongside James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman in the action film Wanted (2008), which proved an international success, earning $341.4 million worldwide.[43] The film received predominantly favorable reviews; writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis noted that Jolie was ""perfectly cast as a super-scary, seemingly amoral assassin,"" adding that ""she cuts the kind of disciplinarian figure who can bring boys of all ages to their knees or at least into their theater seats.""[65]  Changeling in October 2007 Jolie in character as Christine Collins on the set ofin October 2007  Jolie next took the lead role in Clint Eastwood's drama Changeling (2008).[66] Based in part on the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders, the film centers on Christine Collins, who is reunited with her kidnapped son in 1928 Los Angeles, only to realize the boy is an imposter. Chicago Tribune critic Michael Phillips noted, ""Jolie really shines in the calm before the storm, the scenes when one patronizing male authority figure after another belittles her at their peril.""[67] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BAFTA Award, and an Academy Award for Best Actress. Jolie also voiced the DreamWorks animation Kung Fu Panda (2008), the first work in a major family franchise, later reprising her voice role in the sequels Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011) and Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016).  After her mother's death in 2007, Jolie began appearing in fewer films, later explaining that her motivation to be an actress had stemmed from her mother's acting ambitions.[68] Her first film in two years was the thriller Salt (2010), in which she starred as a CIA agent who goes on the run after she is accused of being a KGB sleeper agent. Originally written as a male character with Tom Cruise attached to star, agent Salt underwent a gender change after a Columbia Pictures executive suggested Jolie for the role. With revenues of $293.5 million, Salt became an international success.[43] The film received generally positive reviews, with Jolie's performance in particular earning praise; Empire critic William Thomas remarked, ""When it comes to selling incredible, crazy, death-defying antics, Jolie has few peers in the action business.""[69]  Jolie starred opposite Johnny Depp in the thriller The Tourist (2010). The film was a critical failure, though Roger Ebert defended Jolie's performance, stating that she ""does her darndest"" and ""plays her femme fatale with flat-out, drop-dead sexuality.""[70] Despite the poor critical reception and a slow start at the North American box office, the film went on to gross a respectable $278.3 million worldwide,[43] cementing Jolie's appeal to international audiences.[71] She received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance, which gave rise to speculation that it had been given merely to ensure her high-profile presence at the awards ceremony.[72][73]  2011–present: Professional expansion  After directing the documentary A Place in Time (2007), which was distributed through the National Education Association,[74] Jolie made her feature directorial debut with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), a love story between a Serb soldier and a Bosniak prisoner, set during the 1992–95 Bosnian War. She conceived the film to rekindle attention for the survivors, after twice visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina in her role as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[75] To ensure authenticity, she cast only actors from the former Yugoslavia—including stars Goran Kostić and Zana Marjanović—and incorporated their wartime experiences into her screenplay.[76] Upon release, the film received mixed reviews; Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, ""Jolie deserves significant credit for creating such a powerfully oppressive atmosphere and staging the ghastly events so credibly, even if it is these very strengths that will make people not want to watch what's onscreen.""[77] The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Jolie was named an honorary citizen of Sarajevo for raising awareness of the war.[78]  After a three-and-a-half-year absence from the screen, Jolie starred in Maleficent (2014), a live-action re-imagining of Disney's 1959 animation Sleeping Beauty. Critical reception was mixed, but Jolie's performance in the titular role was singled out for praise;[79] The Hollywood Reporter critic Sherri Linden found her to be the ""heart and soul"" of the film, adding that she ""doesn't chew the estimable scenery in Maleficent—she infuses it, wielding a magnetic and effortless power.""[80] In its opening weekend, Maleficent earned nearly $70 million at the North American box office and over $100 million in other markets, marking Jolie's appeal to audiences of all demographics in both action and fantasy films, genres usually dominated by male actors.[81] The film went on to gross $757.8 million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year and Jolie's highest-grossing film ever.[43][82]  Unbroken in 2014 Jolie at an event forin 2014  Jolie next completed her second directorial venture, Unbroken (2014), about World War II hero Louis Zamperini (1917–2014), a former Olympic track star who survived a plane crash over sea and spent two years in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. She also served as producer under her Jolie Pas banner.[83] Unbroken is based on Laura Hillenbrand's biography of the same name, the film was scripted by the Coen brothers and starred Jack O'Connell.[84] After a positive early reception, Unbroken was considered a likely Best Picture and Best Director contender,[84][85] but it ultimately received mixed reviews and little award recognition,[86] though it was named one of the best films of the year by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute.[87][88] In a typical review, Variety's Justin Chang noted the film's ""impeccable craftsmanship and sober restraint"", but deemed it ""an extraordinary story told in dutiful, unexceptional terms.""[86][89] Financially, Unbroken far outperformed industry expectations in its opening weekend,[90] eventually earning over $163 million worldwide.[91]  Jolie's next directorial effort was the marital drama By the Sea (2015), in which she starred opposite her husband, Brad Pitt, marking their first collaboration since 2005's Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Based on her screenplay, the film was a deeply personal project for Jolie, who drew inspiration from her own mother's life. Critics, however, dismissed it as a ""vanity project,"" as part of an overall poor reception.[92][93] Writing for The Washington Post, Stephanie Merry noted its dearth of genuine emotion, stating, ""By the Sea is dazzlingly gorgeous, as are its stars. But peeling back layer upon layer of exquisite ennui reveals nothing but emptiness, sprinkled with stilted sentiments.""[94] Despite starring two of Hollywood's leading actors, the film received only a limited release.[92]  As Jolie preferred to dedicate herself to her humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained infrequent. First They Killed My Father (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's Khmer Rouge era, again enabled her to combine both interests. In addition to directing the film, she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend Loung Ung, whose memoirs about the regime's child labor camps served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience, the film was produced directly for Netflix, which allowed for the use of an exclusively Khmer cast and script.[95] Labeling Jolie as a ""skilled and sensitive filmmaker"", Rafer Guzmán of Newsday commended her for ""convincingly depict[ing] the illogical hell of the Khmer Rouge era"".[96] It received nominations for the Golden Globe and BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language.[97][98]  Jolie reprised the role of Maleficent in the Disney fantasy sequel Maleficent: Mistress of Evil (2019), which received unfavorable reviews from critics but performed moderately well commercially, with a global gross of $490 million.[99][100][101] She will next star alongside David Oyelowo as grieving parents to the title characters of Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan in the fantasy film Come Away and will star in Taylor Sheridan's thriller Those Who Wish Me Dead, based on Michael Koryta's novel of the same name.[102][103] She has also committed to produce and star in an adaptation of the 2014 James Scott novel The Kept and as Thena in the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero film The Eternals.[104][105]  Humanitarian work  UNHCR ambassadorship  ""We cannot close ourselves off to information and ignore the fact that millions of people are out there suffering. I honestly want to help. I don't believe I feel differently from other people. I think we all want justice and equality, a chance for a life with meaning. All of us would like to believe that if we were in a bad situation someone would help us."" —Jolie on her motives for joining UNHCR in 2001[106]  Jolie first witnessed the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world.[107] Upon her return home, Jolie contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots.[106] To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world. In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed.[106]  In the following months, Jolie returned to Cambodia for two weeks and met with Afghan refugees in Pakistan, where she donated $1 million in response to an international UNHCR emergency appeal,[108][109] the largest donation UNHCR had ever received from a private individual.[110] She covered all costs related to her missions and shared the same rudimentary working and living conditions as UNHCR field staff on all of her visits.[106] Jolie was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27, 2001.[111]  Over the next decade, she went on more than 40 field missions, meeting with refugees and internally displaced persons in over 30 countries.[112] In 2002, when asked what she hoped to accomplish, she stated, ""Awareness of the plight of these people. I think they should be commended for what they have survived, not looked down upon.""[108] To that end, her 2001–02 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels, which was published in October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her humanitarian drama Beyond Borders.  Jolie aimed to visit what she termed ""forgotten emergencies,"" crises that media attention had shifted away from.[113] She became noted for traveling to war zones,[114] such as Sudan's Darfur region during the Darfur conflict,[115] the Syrian-Iraqi border during the Second Gulf War,[116] where she met privately with U.S. troops and other multi-national forces,[117] and the Afghan capital Kabul during the war in Afghanistan, where three aid workers were murdered in the midst of her first visit.[114] To aid her travels, she began taking flying lessons in 2004 with the aim of ferrying aid workers and food supplies around the world;[19][118] she now holds a private pilot license with instrument rating and owns a Cirrus SR22 and Cessna 208 Caravan single-engine aircraft.[119][120][121]  On April 17, 2012, after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie was promoted to the rank of Special Envoy to High Commissioner António Guterres, the first to take on such a position within the organization. In her expanded role, she was given authority to represent Guterres and UNHCR at the diplomatic level, with a focus on major refugee crises.[122] In the months following her promotion, she made her first visit as Special Envoy—her third over all—to Ecuador, where she met with Colombian refugees,[123] and she accompanied Guterres on a week-long tour of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria.[124] Since then, Jolie has gone on over a dozen field missions around the world to meet with refugees and undertake advocacy on their behalf.[112][125]  Conservation and community development  In an effort to connect her Cambodian-born adopted son with his heritage, Jolie purchased a house in his country of birth in 2003. The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province Battambang, adjacent to Samlout national park in the Cardamom mountains, which had become infiltrated with poachers who threatened endangered species. She purchased the park's 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project.[126] In recognition of her conservation efforts, King Norodom Sihamoni awarded her Cambodian citizenship on July 31, 2005.[127]  In November 2006, Jolie expanded the scope of the project—renamed the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation (MJP)—to create Asia's first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals.[128] She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, at the World Economic Forum in Davos,[126] where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, The Diary of Angelina Jolie & Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, which followed them on a trip to a Millennium Village in western Kenya. By mid-2007, some 6,000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie. Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters.[126]  After filming Beyond Borders (2003) in Namibia, Jolie became patron of the Harnas Wildlife Foundation, a wildlife orphanage and medical center in the Kalahari desert. She first visited the Harnas farm during production of the film, which features vultures rescued by the foundation.[129] In December 2010, Jolie and her partner, Brad Pitt, established the Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Foundation to support conservation work by the Naankuse Wildlife Sanctuary, a nature reserve also located in the Kalahari.[130] In name of their Namibian-born daughter, they have funded large-animal conservation projects as well as a free health clinic, housing, and a school for the San Bushmen community at Naankuse.[131][132][133] Jolie and Pitt support other causes through the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, established in September 2006.[134]  Child immigration and education  Jolie has pushed for legislation to aid child immigrants and other vulnerable children in both the U.S. and developing nations, including the ""Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2005.""[111][135] She began lobbying humanitarian interests in the U.S. capital from 2003 onwards, explaining, ""As much as I would love to never have to visit Washington, that's the way to move the ball.""[111] Since October 2008, she has co-chaired Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a network of leading U.S. law firms that provide free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the U.S.[136] Founded in a collaboration between Jolie and the Microsoft Corporation, by 2013, KIND had become the principal provider of pro bono lawyers for immigrant children.[137] Jolie had previously, from 2005 to 2007, funded the launch of a similar initiative, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants' National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children.[135][138]  Ms., in 2015, in which she discusses child marriage Jolie on the cover of, in 2015, in which she discusses child marriage  Jolie has also advocated for children's education. Since its founding at the Clinton Global Initiative's annual meeting in September 2007, she has co-chaired the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, which provides policy and funding to education programs for children in conflict-affected regions.[139] In its first year, the partnership supported education projects for Iraqi refugee children, youth affected by the Darfur conflict, and girls in rural Afghanistan, among other affected groups.[139] The partnership has worked closely with the Council on Foreign Relations' Center for Universal Education—founded by the partnership's co-chair, noted economist Gene Sperling—to establish education policies, which resulted in recommendations made to UN agencies, G8 development agencies, and the World Bank.[140] Since April 2013, all proceeds from Jolie's high-end jewelry collection, Style of Jolie, have benefited the partnership's work.[141] Jolie additionally launched the Malala Fund, a grant system established by Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai, at the 2013 Women in the World Summit;[142] she personally contributed over $200,000 to the cause.[143]  Jolie has funded a school and boarding facility for girls at Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya,[144] which opened in 2005,[145] and two primary schools for girls in the returnee settlements Tangi and Qalai Gudar in eastern Afghanistan, which opened in March 2010 and November 2012 respectively.[146][147] In addition to the facilities at the Millennium Village she established in Cambodia, Jolie had built at least ten other schools in the country by 2005.[148] In February 2006, she opened the Maddox Chivan Children's Center, a medical and educational facility for children affected by HIV, in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh.[128] In Sebeta, Ethiopia, the birthplace of her eldest daughter, she funds a sister facility, the Zahara Children's Center, which is expected to open in 2015 and will treat and educate children suffering from HIV or tuberculosis. Both centers are run by the Global Health Committee.[149]  Jolie is executive producer of the BBC programme My World which aims to teach teenagers how to think critically about what they read and how to tell high-quality journalism from bad.[150]  Human rights and women's rights  British Foreign Secretary William Hague and Jolie at the launch of the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative in May 2012  After Jolie joined the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in June 2007,[151] she hosted a symposium on international law and justice at CFR headquarters and funded several CFR special reports, including ""Intervention to Stop Genocide and Mass Atrocities.""[125][136] In January 2011, she established the Jolie Legal Fellowship,[152] a network of lawyers and attorneys who are sponsored to advocate the development of human rights in their countries.[153] Its member attorneys, called Jolie Legal Fellows, have facilitated child protection efforts in Haiti in the wake of the 2010 earthquake and promoted the development of an inclusive democratic process in Libya following the 2011 revolution.[152][153][154]  Jolie has fronted a campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency. In May 2012, she launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with Foreign Secretary William Hague,[155] who was inspired to campaign on the issue by her Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011).[156] PSVI was established to complement wider UK government work by raising awareness and promoting international co-operation.[155] Jolie spoke on the subject at the G8 foreign ministers meeting,[157] where the attending nations adopted a historic declaration,[155] and before the UN security council, which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date.[158] In June 2014, she co-chaired the four-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, the largest-ever meeting on the subject,[159] which resulted in a protocol endorsed by 151 nations.[160]  Through her work on the PSVI, Jolie met foreign policy experts Chloe Dalton and Arminka Helic, who served as special advisers to Hague. Their collaboration resulted in the 2015 founding of Jolie Pitt Dalton Helic, a partnership dedicated to women's rights and international justice, among other causes.[161] In May 2016, Jolie was appointed a visiting professor at the London School of Economics to contribute to a postgraduate degree program at the university's Centre on Women, Peace and Security,[162] which she had launched with Hague the previous year.[160]  Recognition and honors  Jolie has received wide recognition for her humanitarian work. In August 2002, she received the inaugural Humanitarian Award from the Church World Service's Immigration and Refugee Program,[163] and in October 2003, she was the first recipient of the Citizen of the World Award by the United Nations Correspondents Association.[164] She was awarded the Global Humanitarian Award by the UNA-USA in October 2005,[165] and she received the Freedom Award from the International Rescue Committee in November 2007.[166] In October 2011, UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres presented Jolie with a gold pin reserved for the most long-serving staff, in recognition of her decade as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[167]  In November 2013, Jolie received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, an honorary Academy Award, from the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[168][169] In June 2014, she was appointed an Honorary Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG) for her services to the UK's foreign policy and campaigning to end sexual violence in war zones.[170][171] Queen Elizabeth II presented Jolie with the insignia of her honorary damehood during a private ceremony the following October.[172]  Personal life  Relationships and marriages  Jolie had a serious boyfriend for two years from the age of 14. Her mother allowed them to live together in her home, of which Jolie later said, ""I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my boyfriend or he was going to be with me in my bedroom with my mom in the next room. She made the choice, and because of it, I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way.""[173] She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16.[174]  During filming of Hackers (1995), Jolie had a romance with British actor Jonny Lee Miller, her first lover since the relationship in her early teens.[14] They were not in touch for many months after production ended, but eventually reconnected and married soon after in March 1996. She attended her wedding in black rubber pants and a white T-shirt, upon which she had written the groom's name in her blood.[175] Although the relationship ended for good the following year, Jolie remained on good terms with Miller, whom she called ""a solid man and a solid friend"".[18] Their divorce, initiated by Jolie in February 1999, was finalized shortly before she remarried the next year.[176][177]  Prior to her marriage to Miller, Jolie began a relationship with model-actress Jenny Shimizu on the set of Foxfire (1996). She later said, ""I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn't married my husband. I fell in love with her the first second I saw her.""[178] According to Shimizu, their relationship lasted several years and continued even while Jolie was romantically involved with other people.[179] In 2003, when asked if she was bisexual, Jolie responded, ""Of course. If I fell in love with a woman tomorrow, would I feel that it's okay to want to kiss and touch her? If I fell in love with her? Absolutely! Yes!""[180]  After a two-month courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had met on the set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a relationship at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997).[177] As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media.[181] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later.[182] Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, ""It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but ... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet.""[19]  Jolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston in October 2005. She said she fell in love with Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but she dismissed allegations of an affair,[183] saying, ""To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.""[180] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.[184]  During their twelve-year relationship, the couple were dubbed ""Brangelina""—a portmanteau coined by the entertainment media—and were the subject of worldwide media coverage.[185] Lorraine Ali of Los Angeles Times stated that they became one of Hollywood's most glamorous couples.[186] Their family grew to include six children, three of whom were adopted, before they announced their engagement in April 2012.[187] Jolie and Pitt married on August 23, 2014, at their estate Château Miraval in Correns, France.[188] She subsequently took the name ""Jolie Pitt"".[189] After two years of marriage, the couple separated in September 2016. In her divorce filing, Jolie requested physical custody of their children.[190] On November 11, 2018, a new custody agreement was established between Jolie and Pitt.[191] On April 12, 2019, the court restored Jolie and Pitt to single status.[192]  Children  Jolie's children Maddox Chivan Jolie-Pitt Male, born ( 2001-08-05 ) August 5, 2001 (age 18) , in Cambodia  August 5, 2001 , in Cambodia Adopted March 10, 2002 by Jolie  Adopted early 2006 by Pitt Pax Thien Jolie-Pitt Male, born ( 2003-11-29 ) November 29, 2003 (age 16) , in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam  November 29, 2003 , in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam Adopted March 15, 2007 by Jolie  Adopted February 21, 2008 by Pitt Zahara Marley Jolie-Pitt Female, born ( 2005-01-08 ) January 8, 2005 (age 15) , in Awasa, Ethiopia  January 8, 2005 , in Awasa, Ethiopia Adopted July 6, 2005 by Jolie  Adopted early 2006 by Pitt Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt Female, born ( 2006-05-27 ) May 27, 2006 (age 14) , in Swakopmund, Namibia Knox Léon Jolie-Pitt Male, born ( 2008-07-12 ) July 12, 2008 (age 11) , in Nice, France Vivienne Marcheline Jolie-Pitt Female, born ( 2008-07-12 ) July 12, 2008 (age 11) , in Nice, France  Jolie has six children: three sons and three daughters. Of the children, three were adopted internationally, while three are biological.  On March 10, 2002, Jolie adopted her first child,[193] seven-month-old Maddox Chivan,[26] from an orphanage in Battambang, Cambodia.[194] He was born as Rath Vibol on August 5, 2001,[195] in a local village.[18] After twice visiting Cambodia, while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and on a UNHCR field mission, Jolie returned in November 2001 with her husband, Billy Bob Thornton, where they met Maddox and subsequently applied to adopt him.[196] The adoption process was halted the following month when the U.S. government banned adoptions from Cambodia amid allegations of child trafficking.[196] Although Jolie's adoption facilitator was later convicted of visa fraud and money laundering, her adoption of Maddox was deemed lawful.[197] Once the process was finalized, she took custody of him in Namibia, where she was filming Beyond Borders (2003).[196] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption together, but she adopted Maddox alone,[182][198] and raised him as a single parent following their separation three months later.[182][199]  Changeling in May 2008 A pregnant Jolie with director Clint Eastwood at the Cannes premiere ofin May 2008  Jolie adopted a daughter, six-month-old Zahara Marley, from an orphanage in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 6, 2005.[200][201] Zahara was born as Yemsrach on January 8, 2005, in Awasa.[202][203] Jolie initially believed Zahara to be an AIDS orphan,[204] based on official testimony from her grandmother,[205] but her birth mother later came forward in the media. She explained that she had abandoned her family when Zahara became sick, and said she thought Zahara was ""very fortunate"" to have been adopted by Jolie.[202] Jolie was accompanied by her partner, Brad Pitt, when she traveled to Ethiopia to take custody of Zahara.[200] She later indicated that they had together made the decision to adopt from Ethiopia,[206] having first visited the country earlier that year.[207] After Pitt announced his intention to adopt her children,[208] she filed a petition to legally change their surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was granted on January 19, 2006.[203] Pitt adopted Maddox and Zahara soon after.[209]  In an attempt to avoid the unprecedented media frenzy surrounding their relationship, Jolie and Pitt traveled to Namibia for the birth of their first biological child.[185] On May 27, 2006, she gave birth to a daughter, Shiloh Nouvel, in Swakopmund.[210] They sold the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images with the aim of benefiting charity, rather than allowing paparazzi to take these valuable photographs.[209] People and Hello! purchased the North American and British rights to the images for $4.1 and $3.5 million respectively, a record in celebrity photojournalism at that time,[211] with all proceeds donated to UNICEF.[212]  On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a son, three-year-old Pax Thien, from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.[213] He was born as Pham Quang Sang on November 29, 2003, in HCMC, where he was abandoned by his biological mother soon after birth.[214] After visiting the orphanage with Pitt in November 2006, Jolie applied for adoption as a single parent, because Vietnam's adoption regulations do not allow unmarried couples to co-adopt.[213] After their return to the U.S., she petitioned the court to change her son's surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was approved on May 31.[215] Pitt subsequently adopted Pax on February 21, 2008.[216]  At the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins. For the two weeks she spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, France, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade.[217] She gave birth to a son, Knox Léon, and a daughter, Vivienne Marcheline, on July 12, 2008. The first pictures of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to People and Hello! for a reported $14 million—the most expensive celebrity photographs ever taken. All proceeds were donated to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.[218]  Cancer prevention treatment  On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene.[219] Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer.[220][221] Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation.[222] Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts.[220] Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she underwent a preventive salpingo-oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.[221]  ""I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they have strong options."" —Jolie on her reasons for speaking out about her mastectomy[219]  After completing each operation, Jolie discussed her mastectomy and oophorectomy in op-eds published by The New York Times, with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices. She detailed her diagnosis, surgeries, and personal experiences, and described her decision to undergo preventive surgery as a proactive measure for the sake of her six children.[219][221][223] Jolie further wrote, ""On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.""[219]  Jolie's announcement of her mastectomy attracted widespread publicity and discussion on BRCA mutations and genetic testing.[224] Her decision was met with praise from various public figures,[225] while health campaigners welcomed her raising awareness of the options available to at-risk women.[226] Dubbed ""The Angelina Effect"" by a Time cover story,[227] Jolie's influence led to a ""global and long-lasting"" increase in BRCA gene testing:[228] the number of referrals tripled in Australia and doubled in the UK, parts of Canada, and India,[228][229][230] as well as significantly increased in other European countries and the U.S.[231][232][233] Researchers in Canada and the UK found that despite the large increase, the percentage of mutation carriers remained the same, meaning Jolie's message had reached those most at risk.[228] In her first op-ed, Jolie had advocated wider accessibility of BRCA gene testing and acknowledged the high costs,[234] which were greatly reduced after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a June 2013 ruling, invalidated BRCA gene patents held by Myriad Genetics.[235][236]  In the media  Public image  As the daughter of actor Jon Voight, Jolie appeared in the media from an early age.[25] After embarking on her own career, she earned a reputation as a ""wild child"", which contributed to her early success in the late 1990s and early 2000s.[237] Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives, experiences with drugs, and her sex life, particularly her bisexuality and interest in sadomasochism.[237][238] In 2000, when asked about her outspokenness, she stated, ""I say things that other people might go through. That's what artists should do—throw things out there and not be perfect and not have answers for anything and see if people understand.""[238] Another contributing factor of her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that started when Jolie, upon winning her Oscar, kissed her brother on the lips and said, ""I'm so in love with my brother right now.""[14] She dismissed the rumors, saying, ""It was disappointing that something so beautiful and pure could be turned into a circus,""[239] and explained that, as children of divorce, she and James relied on one another for emotional support.[14]  Jolie's reputation began to change positively after she, at age 26, became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, later commenting, ""In my early 20s I was fighting with myself. Now I take that punk in me to Washington, and I fight for something important.""[111] Owing to her extensive activism, her Q Score—the industry's measure of celebrities' likability—nearly doubled to 25 between 2000 and 2006.[111] Her recognizability grew accordingly; by 2006, she was familiar to 81% of Americans, compared to 31% in 2000.[111] She became noted for her ability to positively influence her public image through the media, without employing a publicist or an agent.[240] Her Q Score remained above average even when, in 2005, she was accused of ending Brad Pitt's marriage to Jennifer Aniston,[241] at which point her public persona became an unlikely combination of alleged homewrecker, mother, sex symbol, and humanitarian.[242] A decade later, Jolie was found to be the most admired woman in the world in global surveys conducted by YouGov in 2015 and 2016.[243][244]  Jolie's general influence and wealth are extensively documented. In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Jolie, together with Pitt, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide.[245] Jolie was the face of St. John and Shiseido from 2006 to 2008, and a decade later became a spokesmodel for Guerlain. Her 2011 endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton, reportedly worth $10 million, was a record for a single advertising campaign.[246][247] Jolie was among the Time 100, a list of the most influential people in the world as published by Time, in 2006 and 2008.[248][249] She was named the world's most powerful celebrity in Forbes's Celebrity 100 issue in 2009, and, though ranked lower overall, was listed as the most powerful actress from 2006 to 2008 and 2011 to 2013.[250][251] Forbes additionally cited her as Hollywood's highest-paid actress in 2009, 2011, and 2013, with estimated annual earnings of $27 million, $30 million, and $33 million respectively.[71][252][253]  Appearance  A Mighty Heart in June 2007; several of her tattoos are visible Jolie at the New York premiere ofin June 2007; several of her tattoos are visible  Jolie's public image is strongly tied to her perceived beauty and sex appeal.[254] Many media outlets, including Vogue, People, and Vanity Fair, have cited her as the world's most beautiful woman, while others such as Esquire, FHM, and Empire have named her the sexiest woman alive; both titles have often been based on public polls in which Jolie places far ahead of other celebrity women.[255] Her most recognizable physical features are her many tattoos, eyes, and in particular her full lips, which The New York Times considered as defining a feature as Kirk Douglas's chin or Bette Davis' eyes.[256] Among her estimated 20 tattoos are the Latin proverb quod me nutrit me destruit (""what nourishes me destroys me""), the Tennessee Williams quote ""A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages"", four Buddhist Sanskrit prayers of protection,[257][258] a twelve-inch tiger, and geographical coordinates of where she first met her adopted children.[259] Over time, she has covered or lasered several of her tattoos, including ""Billy Bob"", the name of her second husband.[257]  Professionally, Jolie's status as a sex symbol has been considered both an asset and a hindrance. Some of her most commercially successful films, including Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Beowulf (2007), overtly relied at least in part on her sex appeal,[260][261] with Empire stating that her ""pneumatic figure"", ""feline eyes"", and ""bee-stung lips"" have greatly contributed to her appeal to cinema audiences.[262] Conversely, Salon writer Allen Barra agreed with critics who suggested that Jolie's ""dark and intense sexuality"" has limited her in the types of roles she can be cast in, rendering her unconvincing in many conventional women's roles,[51] while Clint Eastwood, who directed her Oscar-nominated performance in Changeling (2008), opined that having ""the most beautiful face on the planet"" sometimes harmed her dramatic credibility with audiences.[263]  Beyond her career, Jolie's appearance has been credited with influencing popular culture at large. In 2002, AfterEllen founder Sarah Warn observed that many women of all sexual orientations had publicly expressed their attraction to Jolie, which she considered a new development in American culture, adding that ""there are many beautiful women in Hollywood, and few generate the same kind of overwhelming interest across genders and sexual orientations that she does"".[264] Jolie's physical attributes became highly sought-after among western women seeking cosmetic surgery; by 2007, she was considered ""the gold standard of beauty"",[265] with her full lips remaining the most imitated celebrity feature well into the 2010s.[266][267] After a 2011 repeat survey by Allure found that Jolie most represented the American beauty ideal, compared to model Christie Brinkley in 1991, writer Elizabeth Angell credited society with having ""branched out beyond the Barbie-doll ideal and embraced something quite different"".[268][269] In 2013, Jeffrey Kluger of Time agreed that Jolie has for many years symbolized the feminine ideal, and opined that her frank discussion of her double mastectomy redefined beauty.[227]  Filmography  Awards and nominations  See also",fake

13756,"“The Favourite,” “Green Book” and “A Star Is Born,” Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga’s commercial and critical hit, received five nominations each, including for top acting and movie prizes.  AD  AD  And voters didn’t ignore massive box office sensations. “Black Panther” received three nominations (best original song, score and dramatic movie), and “Crazy Rich Asians” was nominated for best musical or comedy movie and for best actress (Constance Wu).  “Mary Poppins Returns,” which also hasn’t yet been released in theaters nationwide, received four nominations, including consideration for lead actors Emily Blunt and Lin-Manuel Miranda.  And only men are nominated for best directing in a motion picture, nearly a year after Natalie Portman made headlines for introducing that category of “all-male nominees” during the ceremony.  The nominations still leave several questions: Will “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” which cleaned up at the 2018 Emmys and Golden Globes, make a repeat sweep in the three categories it’s nominated in? Will box office disappointments like “Green Book” become voter favorites? Can any song beat the memeable “Shallow”? Does any other supporting actress stand a chance against Patricia Clarkson in “Sharp Objects”?  AD  AD  Andy Samberg (NBC’s “Brooklyn Nine-Nine”) and Sandra Oh (who is nominated for best dramatic actress in the television category for BBC America’s “Killing Eve”) will host the 76th Annual Golden Globe Awards on Jan. 6 on NBC.  This post will update frequently with instant analysis. Refresh to update.  NOMINATIONS BY MOTION PICTURE  “Vice” — 6  “The Favourite” — 5  “Green Book” — 5  “A Star Is Born” — 5  “BlacKkKlansman” — 4  “Mary Poppins Returns” — 4  “Black Panther” — 3  “If Beale Street Could Talk” — 3  “Roma” — 3  NOMINATIONS BY NETWORK  FX — 10  HBO — 9  Prime Video — 9  Netflix — 8  Showtime — 6  NBC — 3  The list of nominations for the 2019 Golden Globes:  Best motion picture, drama  AD  “If Beale Street Could Talk”  “BlacKkKlansman”  “Black Panther”  “Bohemian Rhapsody”  “A Star Is Born”  IMMEDIATE REACTION: Smash hit “A Star Is Born” has been poised to earn best-picture nominations from the moment it premiered at the Venice Film Festival, and “Black Panther,” which broke box-office records and made more than a billion dollars, changed how the industry viewed superhero movies. Barry Jenkins (“If Beale Street Could Talk”) won this award in 2017 for his last film, “Moonlight,” and “BlacKkKlansman” has been framed as Spike Lee’s comeback. The only surprising nominee is arguably “Bohemian Rhapsody,” which soared at the box office but received mixed reviews from critics. Many assumed early on that it would compete in the comedy or musical category.  AD  AD  Best actress in a motion picture, drama  Glenn Close, “The Wife”  Lady Gaga, “A Star Is Born”  Nicole Kidman, “Destroyer”  Melissa McCarthy, “Can You Ever Forgive Me?”  Rosamund Pike, “A Private War”  IMMEDIATE REACTION: “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” is considered one of Melissa McCarthy’s first dramatic projects, while “A Star Is Born” was Lady Gaga’s feature-film debut as a lead actress. On the other hand, we have veteran dramatic film actresses Glenn Close and Nicole Kidman. Rosamund Pike falls somewhere in the middle, with “A Private War” finally giving her another chance to showcase the acting chops that “Gone Girl” proved she had. It’s a tight race.  Best actor in a motion picture, drama  AD  Bradley Cooper, “A Star Is Born”  Willem Dafoe, “At Eternity’s Gate”  Rami Malek, “Bohemian Rhapsody”  John David Washington, “BlacKkKlansman”  AD  Lucas Hedges, “Boy Erased”  IMMEDIATE REACTION: This is probably the less exciting category for Bradley Cooper, who also earned a directing nomination for his debut film. Dafoe’s performance as the much-younger Vincent Van Gogh is said to be one of his best ever, and Rami Malek’s portrayal of Freddie Mercury is the only element of “Bohemian Rhapsody” that almost everyone agreed worked well. This is the first-ever Golden Globe nomination for both John David Washington and Lucas Hedges. Again, another tight race.  AD  Best motion picture, comedy or musical  “Crazy Rich Asians”  “The Favourite”  “Green Book”  “Mary Poppins Returns”  “Vice”  IMMEDIATE REACTION: “Mary Poppins Returns” and “Vice” haven’t hit theaters yet, but both feature promising casts — Emily Blunt and Lin-Manuel Miranda in the former; Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Sam Rockwell in the latter — and stories that will probably evoke very different kinds of nostalgia. “The Favourite” has been described as Yorgos Lanthimos’s most approachable film, while “Crazy Rich Asians” and “Green Book” were both crowd-pleasers.  AD  Best actor in a motion picture, comedy or musical  Christian Bale, “Vice”  Lin-Manuel Miranda, “Mary Poppins Returns”  AD  Viggo Mortensen, “Green Book”  Robert Redford, “The Old Man and the Gun”  John C. Reilly, “Stan and Ollie”  IMMEDIATE REACTION: General audiences have yet to see or hear much about John C. Reilly in “Stan and Ollie,” which hits theaters after Christmas. The other nominees aren’t major surprises: Even critics who disliked “Green Book” praised Viggo Mortensen; the trailer for “Vice,” set for a Christmas-day release, earned major buzz for Christian Bale’s transformation into Dick Cheney; and Lin-Manuel Miranda rapping is among the most memorable aspects of the “Mary Poppins” sequel. Award shows also love swan songs, and Robert Redford, 82, announced that he would retire from acting after “The Old Man and the Gun.”  AD  AD  Best actress in a motion picture, comedy or musical  Emily Blunt, “Mary Poppins Returns”  Olivia Colman, “The Favourite”  Elsie Fisher, “Eighth Grade”  Charlize Theron, “Tully”  Constance Wu, “Crazy Rich Asians”  IMMEDIATE REACTION: At just 15 years old, Elsie Fisher is likely one of the youngest actresses to be nominated in this category. “The Favourite” wisely submitted Olivia Colman as a lead actress, all but securing a nomination for the three main members of its cast. This is a tight race, especially given that Emily Blunt and Charlize Theron’s performances brought their respective films to life. Constance Wu doesn’t seem to stand much of a chance.  Best director, motion picture  Bradley Cooper, “A Star Is Born”  Alfonso Cuarón, “Roma”  Peter Farrelly, “Green Book”  Spike Lee, “BlacKkKlansman”  Adam McKay, “Vice”  AD  IMMEDIATE REACTION: Natalie Portman made headlines in January when she presented this award by introducing “the all-male nominees.” Not much has changed since then. All five of these men were floated as potential contenders before the official announcement, but two are especially notable: Bradley Cooper and Peter Farrelly. “A Star Is Born” is the directorial debut of Cooper, who has previously earned two acting nominations, and “Green Book” is the first Golden Globe nod for Farrelly, known for “There’s Something About Mary” and “Dumb and Dumber.”  Best supporting actress in a motion picture  Amy Adams, “Vice""  Claire Foy, “First Man”  Regina King, “If Beale Street Could Talk”  Emma Stone, “The Favourite”  Rachel Weisz, “The Favourite”  IMMEDIATE REACTION: Strong performances bolster “The Favourite,” so it makes sense that multiple members of the boisterous main trio — which consists of Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz — made the cut. The New York Film Critics Circle recently honored Regina King for her performance as an anguished mother in “If Beale Street Could Talk,” and Amy Adams, while in a movie that has yet to be released, has two Golden Globe wins and six nominations under her belt. Claire Foy is a reliable performer but somewhat of a surprise nominee, as many critics agree that “First Man” gave her little to do.  AD  Best supporting actor in a motion picture  Mahershala Ali, “Green Book”  Timothée Chalamet, “Beautiful Boy”  Adam Driver, “BlacKkKlansman”  Richard E. Grant, “Can You Ever Forgive Me?”  Sam Rockwell, “Vice”  IMMEDIATE REACTION: Pundits predicted a majority of these nominees months ago, especially in the cases of Mahershala Ali, who was nominated for “Moonlight” in 2017; Timothée Chalamet, who was nominated for his lead role in “Call Me By Your Name” in 2018; and Sam Rockwell, who won for “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” in 2018. Some critics argued that Adam Driver outshone lead John David Washington in “BlacKkKlansman,” while Richard E. Grant stole many of his scenes as Melissa McCarthy’s comical sidekick in “Can You Ever Forgive Me?”  Best screenplay, motion picture  “If Beale Street Could Talk”  “The Favourite”  “Green Book”  “Vice”  “Roma”  IMMEDIATE REACTION: More-unusual films often wind up in the best screenplay category, but Paul Schrader’s “First Reformed” didn’t make the cut. “The Favourite” makes sense, given its quippy dialogue, as do the touching “Roma,” buzzy “Vice” and James Baldwin adaptation “If Beale Street Could Talk.” “Green Book” is perhaps the most interesting choice of the bunch, as it was co-written by Nick Vallelonga, the real-life son of Viggo Mortensen’s character, Tony.  Best animated feature film  “Incredibles 2”  “Isle of Dogs”  “Mirai”  “Ralph Breaks the Internet”  “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse”  IMMEDIATE REACTION: The only other animated film that had a real shot was “Early Man,” a stop-motion flick from Nick Park (“Wallace and Gromit,” “Shaun the Sheep”). Disney and Pixar dominate this category every year at the Golden Globes — which tend to nominate one or two international, non-CGI projects to fill out a diverse field — and “Incredibles 2” is poised to continue that trend. The only film that could really pull off an upset is “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” which features a Marvel superhero of color named Miles Morales.  Best foreign language film  “Capernaum”  “Girl”  “Never Look Away”  “Roma”  “Shoplifters”  IMMEDIATE REACTION: The most notable snubs here are Poland’s “Cold War” and South Korea’s “Burning,” both of which many film critics named on their year-end lists. Reviews for “Capernaum,” “Never Look Away” and especially “Shoplifters” are positive, and “Roma,” inspired by director Alfonso Cuarón’s upbringing, seems likely to land an Oscar nomination for best picture. “Girl” is a relatively controversial pick — while it earned a standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival, it features underage frontal nudity and has received backlash from some trans critics.  Best original song  “All the Stars,” “Black Panther”  “Girl in the Movies,” “Dumplin’”  “Revelation,” “Boy Erased”  “Shallow,” “A Star Is Born”  “Requiem for a Private War,” “A Private War”  IMMEDIATE REACTION: Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s “Shallow” is the clear front-runner, having been stuck in everyone’s head since the trailer for “A Star Is Born” first hit YouTube. Kendrick Lamar and SZA’s “All the Stars” had a similar effect — but to a lesser extent — much earlier in the year. The other nominees were slightly less predictable but also bolstered by star power: Dolly Parton sings “Girl in the Movies”; “Requiem for a Private War” is Annie Lennox’s first new solo song in eight years; and “Revelation” succeeded in reaching a younger audience by pairing Sigur Rós frontman Jónsi with pop star Troye Sivan, who also has a supporting role in “Boy Erased.”  Best original score, motion picture  Justin Hurwitz, “First Man”  Marc Shaiman, “Mary Poppins Returns”  Marco Beltrami, “A Quiet Place”  Alexandre Desplat, “Isle of Dogs”  Ludwig Goransson, “Black Panther”  IMMEDIATE REACTION: Like most non-acting categories, there’s often gender disparity among nominated composers. The lack of Nicholas Britell, who was nominated in 2017 for scoring “Moonlight” and seemed likely to earn a nod for “If Beale Street Could Talk,” is notable.  Best TV series, drama  “Killing Eve” (BBC America)  “Homecoming” (Amazon)  “The Americans” (FX)  “Pose” (FX)  “Bodyguard” (Netflix)  IMMEDIATE REACTION: Will “The Americans” finally get its due after (finally) being nominated for its stunning final season? The FX drama could get overshadowed by BBC America’s beloved “Killing Eve,” starring recently announced Golden Globes co-host Sandra Oh.  Best actress in a TV series, drama  Sandra Oh, “Killing Eve” (BBC America)  Julia Roberts, “Homecoming” (Amazon)  Keri Russell, “The Americans” (FX)  Elisabeth Moss, “The Handmaid’s Tale” (Hulu)  Caitriona Balfe, “Outlander” (Starz)  IMMEDIATE REACTION: The Golden Globes love movie stars, so it’s no shock to see Julia Roberts land a nod for “Homecoming” — and plenty of critics seemed to love the series as well. Elisabeth Moss, last year’s winner, might be the one to beat again, although she’ll have some tough competition from Sandra Oh, who is co-hosting the show, and Keri Russell, thanks to a knockout final season of “The Americans.” Caitriona Balfe’s inclusion may seem like a surprise (she didn’t show up on many predictions lists), but this is her fourth-consecutive nomination.  Best actor in a TV series, drama  Matthew Rhys, “The Americans” (FX)  Stephan James, “Homecoming” (Amazon)  Billy Porter, “Pose” (FX)  Jason Bateman, “Ozark” (Netflix)  Richard Madden, “Bodyguard” (Netflix)  IMMEDIATE REACTION: Last year’s winner, Sterling K. Brown, wasn’t even nominated this year. “This Is Us” may have lost a bit of its breakout hit luster, but Brown still gets accolades for his emotional performances every week. In any case, the field is wide open, as the only repeat nominee is Jason Bateman for “Ozark.”  Best TV series, musical or comedy  “Barry” (HBO)  “The Good Place” (NBC)  “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” (Amazon)  “The Kominsky Method” (Netflix)  “Kidding” (Showtime)  IMMEDIATE REACTION: This is a solid lineup for a prestigious category. “Barry” is an obvious choice here — critics loved it — but Bill Hader’s HBO dramedy faces strong competition from last year’s winner, “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” which returned in fine form for its second season this week. The HFPA could also go with “Kidding,” starring two-time Golden Globe winner Jim Carrey, who landed his first nomination in a TV category.  Best actress in a TV series, musical or comedy  Rachel Brosnahan, “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” (Amazon)  Alison Brie, “GLOW” (Netflix)  Kristen Bell, “The Good Place” (NBC)  Debra Messing, “Will & Grace” (NBC)  Candice Bergen, “Murphy Brown” (CBS)  IMMEDIATE REACTION: Look at that — a category with more broadcast TV nominations than streaming services! NBC, network of the Globes, must be especially thrilled. Of course, Brosnahan is the front-runner with her delightful starring role as a housewife turned comedian, but the Globes like to throw curveballs. Given the fact that Candice Bergen landed a spot over some other tough competition (Issa Rae in “Insecure,” Maya Rudolph in “Forever”), she might just take the prize.  Best actor in a TV series, musical or comedy  Bill Hader, “Barry” (HBO)  Donald Glover, “Atlanta” (FX)  Jim Carrey, “Kidding” (Showtime)  Michael Douglas, “The Kominsky Method” (Netflix)  Sacha Baron Cohen, “Who Is America?” (Showtime)  IMMEDIATE REACTION: Fun fact: This is a completely different lineup from last year, with no repeat names. And with the exception of Donald Glover (who won two years ago for “Atlanta”), none of these actors has ever been in this category before. While you could have probably guessed that movie stars like Jim Carrey and Michael Douglas would show up here, it is a bit of a mystery that Ted Danson of “The Good Place” was left off the list. (And just for the record, we predict that Sacha Baron Cohen will walk away with this, although Bill Hader may be a close second.)  Best TV movie or limited series  “Sharp Objects” (HBO)  “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story” (FX)  “A Very English Scandal” (Amazon)  “Escape at Dannemora” (Showtime)  “The Alienist” (TNT)  IMMEDIATE REACTION: Leave it to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to remind us of shows we completely overlooked this year — like Amazon’s “A Very English Scandal,” which originally aired as a BBC miniseries. Beyond that, the category shows love to several critically acclaimed series and TNT’s “The Alienist,” which seems to be an awards show favorite this year. HBO’s “Sharp Objects” feels like the one to beat, but don’t discount “Escape at Dannemora” or Ryan Murphy’s “The Assassination of Gianni Versace.” Basically, it’s anyone’s game.  Best actress in a TV movie or limited series  Amy Adams, “Sharp Objects” (HBO)  Patricia Arquette, “Escape at Dannemora” (Showtime)  Laura Dern, “The Tale” (HBO)  Regina King, “Seven Seconds” (Netflix)  Connie Britton, “Dirty John” (Bravo)  IMMEDIATE REACTION: The only name we’re surprised to see here is Connie Britton, who is nominated for Bravo’s disappointing limited series “Dirty John,” which is based on the popular Los Angeles Times series turned podcast. The prize could really go to any of the women in this category, but we won’t be surprised if Amy Adams takes it for HBO’s closely watched “Sharp Objects.”  Best actor in a TV movie or limited series  Darren Criss, “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story” (FX)  Hugh Grant, “A Very English Scandal” (Amazon)  Benedict Cumberbatch, “Patrick Melrose” (Showtime)  Antonio Banderas, “Genius: Picasso” (National Geographic)  Daniel Brühl, “The Alienist” (TNT)  IMMEDIATE REACTION: This is pretty much what we expected from this category. Criss’s performance in “The Assassination of Gianni Versace” won him critical acclaim — and an Emmy — but we’re keeping our eyes on two voter favorites: Hugh Grant and Benedict Cumberbatch.  Best supporting actress in a series, limited series or TV movie  Patricia Clarkson, “Sharp Objects” (HBO)  Thandie Newton, “Westworld” (HBO)  Penélope Cruz, “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story” (FX)  Alex Borstein, “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” (Amazon)  Yvonne Strahovski, “The Handmaid’s Tale” (Hulu)  IMMEDIATE REACTION: There were at least two shoo-ins on this list: Yvonne Strahovski had a standout season on “The Handmaid’s Tale,” and Patricia Clarkson’s brutal performance in the grisly “Sharp Objects” made plenty of headlines. While Penélope Cruz and Thandie Newton were also loved by critics and voters alike, Alex Borstein is the lone comedy nominee. Although it seems like a long shot that she could triumph over Clarkson, Borstein did win the Emmy this year for her “Maisel” role.  Best supporting actor in a series, limited series or TV movie  Edgar Ramirez, “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story” (FX)  Ben Whishaw, “A Very English Scandal” (Amazon)  Henry Winkler, “Barry” (HBO)  Alan Arkin, “The Kominsky Method” (Netflix)  Kieran Culkin, “Succession” (HBO)  IMMEDIATE REACTION: It feels safe to say that few people (if anyone) expected this list to include Kieran Culkin of “Succession,” the HBO drama about a very wealthy and very dysfunctional family that owns a media empire. The rest were a bit more predictable, including this year’s Emmy winner in this category, Henry Winkler.  Correction: An earlier version of this article listed “The Handmaid’s Tale” as a nominee for best drama series. It was not nominated in that category. This post has been updated.",real
17583,"Absolutely nowhere is safe for Tristan Thompson, not even Canada. On Tuesday night, the Cavs played against the Toronto Raptors for a thrilling first game that went into overtime. Raptors fans, including Drake, definitely aren't happy with last night's outcome, but there are other storylines taking place, including off the court, as fans took advantage of the opportunity to troll Thompson hardcore for being caught in a cheating scandal.  As E! News points out, while Thompson was at the free throw line toward the end of the game, fans began chanting Khloé in unison. Take a listen in the clip below.  Thompson still made the shot as people poked fun at his recently aired out dirty laundry. Last month, reports surfaced from multiple outlets that Thompson was cheating on his nine-months pregnant baby mama Khloé Kardashian. More video later surfaced, revealing that Thompson is a serial cheater, and probably fooled around with at least five women not named Khloé.  The reality TV star recently gave birth to their first baby girl, True Thompson, and is reportedly attempting to make things work, but Kim is definitely not here for it.

The 24-year-old candidly discussed her new album, Younger Now and how she didn't want Hemsworth to listen to it before it premiered, including the fact she won't tour to support the record because of her two pigs. ""Literally the only reason I'm not touring is because of those f--ing pigs,"" she said. ""That's how much I love those pigs."" Read on to see what else Cyrus had to say.  On Liam Hemsworth While the two are happily together now, they previously broke up in 2013 after calling off their engagement. Hemsworth needed a place to live, so he unknowingly purchased the Malibu home Cyrus had used to record her first album. ""The person [selling the house] hid all the plaques in the garage so he would still buy the house,"" Cyrus explained, according to E! News. ""So then he went to move in and he was like 'F---, I cannot get away, this b---- is all over my f---ing house!"" Now, the two live in the house together, and Cyrus even wrote her song ""Malibu"" about the space. The singer said Hemsworth is ""the most normal NORMAL part of my life.""  On the VMAs Cyrus famously caused controversy at the 2013 show when she performed with Robin Thicke, gyrating on the singer while wearing a nude latex ensemble and a foam finger.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “We have to take our time,” she explained. “I’ve made plenty of mistakes in my past. We’re mature now. We’re grown-ups, and we’re going to take our time and we’re going to do things at our own pace.”  The 48-year-old continued, “Our life right now is incredibly wonderful. Between our kids and our work, we’re truly blessed. We don’t need anything more right now.”  Lopez has been married three times — to waiter Ojani Noa (1997 to 1998), dancer Cris Judd (2001 to 2002) and Marc Anthony (2004 to 2014), with whom she shares 10-year-old twins Emme and Max. In 2002, the singer was also engaged to Ben Affleck. Meanwhile, Rodriguez shares daughters Ella, 10, and Natasha, 13, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis.  As for “El Anillo”? It was “written about the two of us, but it’s like, not about the two of us,” Lopez explained.  “It’s not like I’m like, ‘Hey …. Where’s my ring?'” she said. “No, it’s not like that.”  The Shades of Blue star added, “I feel like they wrote it because … they want that to happen.”  Image zoom Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez Mark Sagliocco/Getty  During a recent sit-down on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Lopez revealed what it would take to break up with the former baseball star.  “I’m so competitive [in] every way. I don’t know, it’s just something inside me, I’m competitive,” she explained. “When we work out I think, ‘I can beat you.’ I’m not laughing.”  However, Lopez said that her 42-year-old beau “doesn’t even entertain my delusions” — and that’s probably for the best.  “There’s no winning that because if he beats me, it’s over!” she joked.  Instead of battling, the couple are extremely supportive of each other. Lopez shared that Rodriguez attends her shows in Las Vegas and she’ll go to baseball games that he’s commentating on, even wearing an earpiece so she can listen to him.

2292,"The first thing you’ll notice about the Dark Knight in Batman v. Superman, the second installation of the newly re-launched DC Universe, is that he’s gotten bigger in stature, muscle, and armor. The next? He’s also badder—gruff, aggressive, and the kind of character willing to square up to the Man of Steel. Given this, you might miss the third fact, that Batman — or at least Ben Affleck, the actor playing him—is also, well, middle-aged.  “I knew that a big part of the audience’s expectation around the role would be how I looked physically,” Affleck, 43, tells Men’s Journal over email. “And that was something I had some control over. If I was going to fail in this role, I wasn’t going to let it be in a way that could have been prevented if I had worked harder.” Director Zack Snyder believes that he got the job done, recently voicing his approval of Affleck’s portrayal as the iconic character, in both of his personas: “He’s an amazing Bruce Wayne, let’s just be frank about that. And then when he puts the cowl on, you know he’s got the chin for it.”  Affleck accomplished the proper frame with help from longtime trainer Walter Norton Jr., of the Institute of Performance and Fitness, who he began training with through a mutual friend during his fitness preparation for 2010’s The Town. Based in Boston, Norton makes almost weekly flights between his hometown and wherever Affleck is, whether it’s in Los Angeles or on location. “Getting ready for this role meant working hard, day in and day out with Walter,” says Affleck. “But it was the kind of work where I felt gains in not only my size, but also my mental and physical health.”  There are benefits of having history with a trainer. “Seven years ago the body bounced back a little quicker,” says Norton. “Like any relationship, it’s all about communication and honesty. I can tell him a little something that he doesn’t want to hear and that’s fine. We’re not tiptoeing around issues. So we just addressed it right at the top. We did what we needed to do to take care of him and protect his joints.”  But that does not mean that Affleck had it easy. Every week Norton created a new regime for him with specific goals, targeting each muscle group relentlessly, and with that mentality they found themselves even overachieving their target numbers. In context, Affleck weighed in at 198 pounds for The Town, and for Batman V. Superman, he went all the way to 231 at 7.7 percent body fat, which they ended up “dialing back” to 225. “This time around we did more bodybuilding. We wanted him to be strong but we wanted to add mass. The volume was higher. We lived on a lot of the basics, 80-pound dumbbell curls, heavy-loaded carries, and farmers walks with 60-pound weights.”  Affleck needed that extra strength on set: The batsuit weighs some 75 pounds. There are also plenty of workout scenes making their way into the final cut, showing off his ripped physique, like one he shot in the Batcave doing pull-ups, while strapped to an additional 50 pounds in weight. “If I had to say there were any critical exercises that we always went back to, it was pull-ups and chin-ups.”  “We wanted him to look like a thick MMA heavyweight puncher,” explains Norton. “This is a Bruce Wayne who’s been lifting for 20 years, hitting that heavyweight bag, and working out every day in the manor. I’ll just say that if you lined up all the Batmans before Ben and stood them next to each other, they’re not 6’4”, and they don’t weigh 225 pounds. He’s in a whole other class.”  Here’s a two-day glimpse at the workouts Norton created for Affleck as part of their two-year training program. You might not want to try this one on your own, though. “I recommend that people find a trainer who they get along with, create their own program suiting their own goals, and if they approach it with the same enthusiasm that Ben did, they can also make gains like a hero.”  Day 1:  Block 1 (32 minutes): Warm-up & Movement  Elliptical (Strength Program): 15 minutes  Rumble Roller (Hip/TFL/VMO/2 Way Glute/Calf): 9 minutes  Plank with Arm Extension: 10 seconds (then 8 reps of 2-second extension for each side)  Spiderman: From a plank, bring you right foot next to your right hand. 3 reps for each side (hold for 2 breaths)  Inchworm: From touching your toes with straight legs, walk your hands out to a plank, then walk your feet back under you, 5 reps (hold for 1 breath)  Calf Stretch: 15 seconds (each leg)  Block 2 (40 minutes): Torso & Strength  Dumbbell Farmer’s Walk: 4 walks with appropriate weight for 1 minute  Alternating Hanging Knee-Up: 11 reps (for each leg)  ½ Kneeling Row: Kneel on your right knee in front of a cable machine, row with your right arm, 4 sets of 12 reps on each side  Back Bridge: 2 reps of 15 second hold (5-second pause between)  Alternating Dumbbell Reverse Lunge: 8 reps (for each leg)  Pull-Up: 6 sets of 4 reps (hold for 4 seconds up and 4 seconds down)  Shoulder Bridge: 10-second hold (then 8 reps of 2-second extension for each side)  Block 3 (22 minutes / Doing As Many Sets As Possible): Strength & Fitness  Airdyne Bike Sprint: 20 seconds  V-Grip Pulldown: 15 reps  Seated Row Handle Grip: 12 reps  Alternating Dumbbell Open Curl: 5 sets of 5 reps (each arm, then 5 reps together)  Goblet Squat: 8 reps  Lateral Squat: 6 reps (each side)  Day 2:  Block 1 (30 minutes): Warm-up & Movement  Airdyne Bike Sprint: 10 reps of 5 minutes at 75% (finish with 15-second sprint, then 45-second rest)    Soft Roller (Upper Back/Lat/Quad/Glute/Ham Junction): 8 minutes  Brettzel Stretch : 2 reps for each side (hold for 5 breaths)  Kneeling Lat: 1 rep each side (hold for 5 breaths)  ½ Kneeling Quad Stretch: 2 reps for each side (hold for 5 breaths)  Brettzel: 2 reps for each side (hold for 5 breaths)  Block 2 (32 minutes): Torso & Strength  Off-Bench Oblique Side Crunch: 8 reps dynamic (followed with hold for 8 seconds)  Valslide Body Slide: 4 sets of 12 reps  Dumbbell Lateral Raise: 4 sets of 12 reps  Back Bridge with March: Hold bridge for 8 seconds (then 4 knee raises on each leg)  Dumbbell Shrug: 5 sets of 6 reps  Rear Delt Machine: 4 sets of 15 reps  1 Leg Hip Lift : 3 sets of 8 reps for each side (hold for 2 seconds)  Tricep Pushdown: 4 sets of 10 heavy reps, then 10 lighter reps  Block 3 (36 minutes): Strength  Dumbbell Deadlift: 4 sets of 6 reps  Dumbbell Bench Press: 4 sets of 10 reps (count 3 seconds from up to down position)  Pec Fly: 4 sets of 12 reps  Ball Leg Curl: 4 sets of 6 reps (hold for 2 seconds)  Batman v Superman is in theaters March 25, 2016.  https://youtube.com/watch?v=fis-9Zqu2Ro%3Frel%3D0%26controls%3D0%26showinfo%3D0  For access to exclusive gear videos, celebrity interviews, and more, subscribe on YouTube!",fake

1623,"However much Tom Hiddleston might be denying that his turn in the updated espionage thriller The Night Manager was his way of auditioning to be the next James Bond, it certainly seems fans are having none of it. Coral bookmakers in the U.K. had to suspend betting on the actor, The Guardian reports, after a huge bet launched the actor’s perceived chances from 2-1 to 1-2. Similarly, the Ireland-based independent bookmaker BoyleSports announced Sunday in a press release that they’d also been forced to suspend betting after Hiddleston’s support skyrocketed. It seems, regardless of what anyone claims, the world is really trying to will this casting decision into existence—and really, who can blame anyone for trying?  According to BoyleSports’s release, Hiddleston was the 6-4 favorite for them before the whirlwind of bets—including one four-figure online bet from the U.K. Hiddleston was his nearest rival at 5-2, followed by Idris Elba and Damian Lewis, who were tied at 5-1.  “Judging by the gamble on Tom Hiddleston we expect that it’s only a matter of days before he is announced as Daniel Craig’s replacement,” BoyleSports representative Liam Glynn said in the press release. That might be a little hyperbolic, and lacking in knowledge of how Hollywood business deals usually work, but it’s easy to see why Glynn is excited. Hiddleston speculation—and betting—has been on the rise at least since March.  Earlier this month, Hiddleston delivered a typically charming deflection of the rumors he was being eyed as Bond on The Graham Norton Show. “I promise, no one’s talked to me about it,” he said with a chuckle. It’s not the first time he’s had to deny it, and it won’t be the last. But this particular surge probably springs from the fact that a “source” told the Daily Mail that Hiddleston had been spotted meeting with Bond director Sam Mendes. Mendes, for his part, has already said he’s really done with the franchise this time following Spectre. And of course, Hiddleston’s reps have already said the storied meeting was “completely false.”  So, where does this leave Bond fans? Basically, right back where they started—waiting to find out whether or not Daniel Craig is actually done with the role, and brainstorming all of his enticing potential replacements. Except, you know, with no bets for a little while.",fake

7938,"For most of their careers, Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson were third-tier pop stars. Simpson was always the bronze medal to Christina Aguilera’s silver and Britney Spears’s gold. Likewise, Lachey and his boy band, 98 Degrees, were consistently afterthoughts to the insanely popular Backstreet Boys and NSYNC. But thanks to a little show called Newlyweds: Nick & Jessica in 2003, MTV catapulted these two into household names. Simpson’s dumb blonde act (at least, we’re pretty sure it was an act) gave us so many gems that the couple forever secured their place in pop culture, even though they split only 3 years later in 2005. To get an idea of what went on behind the scenes, we spoke to Sue Kolinsky, who served as producer on the show for all three seasons of Newlyweds. Kolinsky, who lives in Los Angeles and still works in the television industry, is a three-time Emmy nominated producer. She has popular reality shows such Top Chef, Last Comic Standing and The Osbournes on her resume. Kolinsky spilled on the show's surprising success, Jessica's dumb blonde ""act"" and the tension between the couple in the last season.  Were you fans of Nick and/or Jessica before production started?  I had no idea who Jessica was.  So how did you end up working on the show?  A group of us had worked with MTV on The Osbournes, and then two shows came up, and we had a choice between Rich Girls with Tommy Hilfiger's daughter or Newlyweds. I just chose Newlyweds because it sounded fun to be inside the world of somebody's brand new marriage. As soon as we started looking at the footage and I saw the ""Is this chicken or fish?"" [scene], I knew it was going to be a really fun ride.  Did you suspect the show was going to be as successful as it turned out?  With the success of The Osbournes, we knew that this would probably be successful just based on the nature of the show. It was a whole new genre. When it comes to reality tv, back then it was at its purest form. Plus, [Nick & Jessica] were perfect because they were polar opposites, they were beautiful, and without even realizing it, they were very funny.  What’s your take on people who said Jessica was just putting on a “dumb blonde” act?  There were times when we were like, ""Hm, does she really not know what this means?"" I truly believe the whole 'chicken & fish' situation was accurate. She really did not know. I remember there was a scene where there was a dead mouse by their pool and it had been dead for a while. Nick said, ""it's in rigor mortis"" and Jessica said, ""Riga-what?"" I truly believe she didn't know what that meant.  Did you ever interact with Nick and Jessica personally?  I would go out into the field occasionally and go to the shoots. They were nice. Nick was a little more accessible than Jessica, but she was very sweet and it was fun hanging out with them.  They split up soon after the last season aired. What was it like to be on set at that time?  You could feel there was tension between the two of them. They were very different people. He was a blue collar guy—he did a lot of things himself, like he and his brother would build things. He was frugal, and she had excessive taste. In the end they weren't suited for each other. The only thing they really had in common was their music. She was really young; I think he's seven years older than her. He wanted a family, and her father thought maybe she was too young. Her father was very involved in her life.  Did you have any interaction with Joe Simpson?  The first season, I didn’t [interact with] him, really. But with the popularity of the show, he was given an executive producer credit and he did get a little more involved. He had a little more say in what went in and out of the episode. Not a tremendous amount.  Do you still keep in touch with anyone from the Newlyweds set?  Oh yes, I've forged amazing friendships just from that whole experience. We have reunions a lot of the time—we're very close. It was a really special time for all of us. We joked about the days when we'd go to a club and there wouldn't be any seats and you could tell [the hostess] ""we work on The Osbournes and they'd let us in.

They believe the negative emotions coursing through the kid’s body, the adrenaline and hatred, will give them special powers. It’s a Hollywood thing influenced by old school Satanism.“  Speaking at a post-screening Q&A for documentary Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond in New York, Carrey said that Christmas and New Year are a time of year he dreads, because of the “dark energy pulsating around Tinsel Town” and his knowledge of “what goes on behind the closed doors of the elite at this time of year.“  “Luciferians in Hollywood turn Christmas into the darkest festival of the year,” Carrey said, before explaining “there is a reason why people around the world feel a heaviness at this time of year.“  “Institutional oppression and Satanism hang in the air while we are all forced to wear smiles and ignore the gut feeling that all is not well.”  “Ever notice how all the homeless children you see throughout the year begin to dissapear at Xmas? You think it’s because they’ve found a home, found shelter, found love and warmth?“  “Christmas time is Satanic slaughter time. They are determined to pervert the most beautiful time of the year into a festival of suffering and blood.”  Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond charts Jim Carrey’s evolution into cult comedian Andy Kaufman for 1999 film Man on the Moon, a performance which saw Carrey maintain the Kaufman’s oddball identity for the duration of the shoot. However in New York on Friday, Carrey warned of the seriousness of his allegations against Hollywood elite.  “The entertainment industry is the PR and brainwashing branch of the New World Order, the globalist empire of Lucifarianism,” Carrey said, warning. “There will be a strong push to normalize Satanism in 2018.

The Billboard Music Awards show had been held annually since 1990 and the event was formerly held in December[1] until it went dormant in 2006. The awards returned in 2011 and are now held annually in May.  Awards process [ edit ]  Unlike other awards, such as the Grammy Award, which determine nominations as a result of the highest votes received by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the Billboard Music Awards finalists are based on album and digital songs sales, streaming, radio airplay, touring, and social engagement.

The 2018 awards are based on the reporting period of April 8, 2017 through March 31, 2018.[2] Awards are given for the top album, artist and single in a number of different music genres.  Awards [ edit ]  [7] This field shows winners of ""Artist of the Year"" (awarded from 1995 to 2006), and ""Top Artist"" (awarded since 2011).

5714,"First Lady of the United States  Melania Trump ( ; born Melanija Knavs; [mɛˈlaːnija ˈknaːu̯s], Germanized as Melania Knauss; April 26, 1970) is a Slovenian-American former model, businesswoman, and the current first lady of the United States, as the wife of the 45th president of the United States Donald Trump.[2]  Melanija Knavs was born in Novo Mesto, and grew up in Sevnica, in the Yugoslav republic of Slovenia.[3] She worked as a fashion model through agencies in Milan and Paris, and moved to New York City in 1996.[4] Her modeling career was associated with Irene Marie Models and Trump Model Management.[5]  In 2001, Knavs became a permanent resident of the United States.[6] She married Donald Trump in 2005 and obtained U.S. citizenship in 2006. She is the second first lady, after Louisa Adams, born outside the United States,[7] the first one to be a naturalized citizen[8] and the first whose native language is not English.[9]  Early life  Melanija Knavs was born in Novo Mesto, SR Slovenia (then part of Yugoslavia), on April 26, 1970.[10][11] Her father, Viktor Knavs (born March 24, 1944), was from the nearby town of Radeče and managed car and motorcycle dealerships for a state-owned vehicle manufacturer.[12][13] Her mother Amalija (née Ulčnik) (born July 9, 1945) came from the village of Raka and worked as a patternmaker at the children's clothing manufacturer Jutranjka in Sevnica.[14][15] As a child, Melania and other children of workers at the factory participated in fashion shows that featured children's clothing.[16] She has an older sister, Ines, who is an artist and her ""longtime confidant"",[17][18][19] and an older half-brother—whom she reportedly has never met—from her father's previous relationship.[20][21]  Knavs grew up in a modest apartment in a housing block in Sevnica, in the Lower Sava Valley.[2][22] Her father was in the League of Communists of Slovenia, which espoused a policy of state atheism.[23] As was common, however, he had his daughters secretly baptized as Catholics. When the Trumps met Pope Francis at the Vatican in 2017, Melania brought her rosary and asked the Pope to bless it.[24][25]  When Knavs was a teenager, she moved with her family to a two-story house in Sevnica.[26] As a high-school student, she lived in a high-rise apartment in Ljubljana. She attended the Secondary School of Design and Photography in Ljubljana[27] and studied architecture and design at the University of Ljubljana for one year before she dropped out.[28][29][30]  Career  Melania Trump at QVC Red Carpet Style Party, 2011  Knavs began modeling at five years old and started doing commercial work at sixteen when she posed for the Slovenian fashion photographer Stane Jerko.[31][32] When she began working as a model, she adapted the Slovene version of her last name ""Knavs"" to the German version ""Knauss"".[33]  At eighteen, Knauss signed with a modeling agency in Milan, Italy.[34] In 1992, she was named runner-up in the Jana Magazine ""Look of the Year"" contest, held in Ljubljana, which promised its top three contestants an international modeling contract.[10][35]  After attending the University of Ljubljana for one year,[36] Knauss modeled for fashion houses in Paris and Milan, where in 1995 she met Metropolitan Models co-owner Paolo Zampolli, a friend of her future husband Donald Trump, who was on a scouting trip in Europe. Zampolli urged her to travel to the United States, where he said he would like to represent her.[16]  In 1996, Knauss moved to Manhattan.[16][35][34][37] Zampolli arranged for her to share an apartment with photographer Matthew Atanian in Zeckendorf Towers in Union Square.[16]  Knauss was featured in a sexually explicit photoshoot for the January 1996 issue of Max, a now-defunct French men's magazine, with another female model.[38] She also posed nude for the January 2000 edition of GQ magazine, appearing on the cover naked but for diamond jewelry, reclining on fur, aboard Trump's custom-fitted Boeing 727.[39] Asked about the photos in 2016, Donald Trump said: ""Melania was one of the most successful models, and she did many photo shoots, including for covers and major magazines. [The Max photo] was a picture taken for a European magazine prior to my knowing Melania. In Europe, pictures like this are very fashionable and common.""[40][41]  In 2010, Trump launched her own line of jewelry, Melania Timepieces, and Jewelry, for sale on QVC. She also marketed a Melania Skin Care Collection, sold in high-end department stores.[42] According to a financial filing in 2016, her businesses brought in between $15,000 and $50,000 in royalties that year.[43] In 2017, the two companies that manufactured her jewelry and skincare products under license said they had terminated their relationship with her.[44] On inauguration day her companies and products were listed in her official White House biography, but they were quickly removed.[45] A White House spokesperson said her companies are no longer active and ""the First Lady has no intention of using her position for profit and will not do so.""[44]  Acquisition of U.S. citizenship  Knauss came to the United States from Slovenia in 1996. She resided in the U.S. briefly on a visitor's visa and then obtained H-1B work visas. In 2000 she petitioned for a right to permanent residency under the EB-1 program, a program designed for people with ""extraordinary abilities.""[46] According to information from the Migration Policy Institute, only 2 percent of people in their field would be expected to qualify.[47] The Washington Post reports that at that time Knauss's credentials included ""runway shows in Europe, a Camel cigarette billboard ad in Times Square and — in her biggest job at the time — a spot in the swimsuit edition of Sports Illustrated, which featured her on the beach in a string bikini, hugging a six-foot inflatable whale.""[46][47][48] In the analysis of Joel Gunter of the BBC, ""[Melania Trump] does not appear at the time to have excelled in a niche area of modelling, nor won awards or had her work written about in significant publications""; Gunter reports a conjecture that ""she may have been boosted by high-profile testimonial letters, said Nita Upadhye, a US immigration specialist at NNU Immigration Law. Testimonials form part of the application, and the more high-profile the reference the more weight it carries. If Mrs Trump, already dating Mr Trump at the time she applied, secured letters from luminaries in fashion, that would be significant, Ms Upadhye said.""[46]  During the months that she campaigned with her husband prior to his successful bid for presidency, Melania Trump defended his hard-line on immigration practices and laws by stating that her own path and achievement of citizenship had been legal, unlike those of the individuals Donald Trump was campaigning against. However, investigative reporting done by the Associated Press revealed that she had been paid for 10 modeling jobs she had done before she had obtained her H1-B work visa and was still living in the U.S using her visitor visa. The Associated Press commented that ""Foreigners are not allowed to use a visitor visa to work for pay in the U.S. for American companies. Doing so would violate the terms of that visa and could prohibit a foreigner from later changing his or her immigration status in the U.S. or bar the foreigner from the United States again without special permission to come back.""[6]  Melania Trump obtained her citizenship in 2006. According to media reports she sponsored her parents, Viktor and Amalija Knavs, who went through the immigration process using ""chain migration"", a route that the president has repeatedly criticized.[49][50]  Relationship with Donald Trump  Early relationship  In September 1998, Knauss met real estate mogul Donald Trump at a party and the couple began dating[51] while Trump was in the process of divorcing his second wife, Marla Maples. The divorce was finalized in 1999.[52][53] Knauss continued her modeling career[16] with her American magazine cover shoots, including In Style Weddings,[54] New York magazine, Avenue,[55] Philadelphia Style,[56] Vanity Fair,[57] and Vogue.[58] In 1999, the couple gained attention after a lewd interview with Shock jock Howard Stern on his show.[13][59]  Knauss appeared with Trump while he campaigned for the 2000 Reform Party presidential nomination. When she was asked by The New York Times what her role would be if Donald Trump were to become president, she replied: ""I would be very traditional, like Betty Ford or Jackie Kennedy.""[60]  Marriage  Knauss and Donald Trump became engaged in 2004. On January 22, 2005, they married in an Anglican service at the Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea in Palm Beach, Florida, followed by a reception in the ballroom at her husband's Mar-a-Lago estate.[61][62] The marriage was her first and his third. The event was attended by celebrities such as Katie Couric, Matt Lauer, Rudy Giuliani, Heidi Klum, Star Jones, P. Diddy, Shaquille O'Neal, Barbara Walters, Conrad Black, Regis Philbin, Simon Cowell, Kelly Ripa, then-Senator Hillary Clinton, and former president Bill Clinton.[62][63] At the reception, Billy Joel serenaded the crowd with ""Just the Way You Are"" and supplied new lyrics to the tune of ""The Lady Is a Tramp"".[62] The Trumps' wedding ceremony and reception were widely covered by the media.[37] She wore a $200,000 dress made by John Galliano of the house of Christian Dior.[62]  On March 20, 2006, she gave birth to their son, Barron William Trump.[64] She chose his middle name, while her husband chose his first name.[65]  2016 presidential campaign  Melania gives the thumbs up at a campaign event with her husband Donald and son Barron, November 2015  In November 2015, she was asked about her husband's presidential campaign and replied: ""I encouraged him because I know what he will do and what he can do for America. He loves the American people and he wants to help them.""[66] She played a relatively small role in her husband's campaign, which is atypical of spouses of presidential candidates.[67][68][69]  In 2016, she told CNN her focus as first lady would be to help women and children. She also said she would combat cyberbullying, especially among children.[70]  In July 2016, her official website was redirected to trump.com. On Twitter, she stated that her site was outdated and did not ""accurately reflect [her] current business and professional interests"".[71]  2016 RNC and plagiarism concerns  On July 18, 2016, she gave a speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention. The speech contained a paragraph that was nearly identical to a paragraph of Michelle Obama's speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.[72][73][74] When asked about the speech, Melania said she wrote the speech herself ""with as little help as possible.""[75] Two days later, Trump staff writer Meredith McIver took responsibility and apologized for the ""confusion"".[76]  Melania was again accused of plagiarizing Michelle Obama's speeches when, as part of her ""Be Best"" campaign in 2018, she gave a speech that appeared to closely echo remarks by Michelle Obama in 2016, and also distributed a written pamphlet that was nearly identical to one published by the Obama administration in 2014.[77][78]  Lawsuit against Daily Mail and General Trust  In February 2017, she sued Daily Mail and General Trust, the owner of British tabloid, the Daily Mail, seeking $150 million in damages over an August 2016 article that alleged that she had worked for an escort service during her modeling days. The lawsuit stated the article had ruined her ""unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"" to establish ""multimillion dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which Plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world"".[79] Her claim raised potential ethical questions with its implication that she intended to profit from being first lady.[80]  On February 18, 2017, the lawsuit was amended, removing the language about her earning potential and focusing instead on emotional distress.[81] In April 2017, the parties settled the lawsuit and the Daily Mail issued a statement that said, ""We accept that these allegations about Mrs. Trump are not true and we retract and withdraw them."" The Mail agreed to pay her $2.9 million.[82][83]  Statement on bullying  Five days before the election, she told a crowd of supporters in Pennsylvania: ""Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially to children and teenagers. It is never OK when a 12-year-old girl or boy is mocked, bullied, or attacked. It is terrible when that happens on the playground. And it is absolutely unacceptable when it is done by someone with no name hiding on the Internet.""[84] Regarding the contrast of her platform with her husband's use of Twitter during his campaign, Melania said shortly after the election that she had rebuked him ""all the time"" but that ""he will do what he wants to do in the end"".[85]  First Lady of the United States  Melania on Inauguration Day  Donald and Melania at the Liberty Ball on Inauguration Day, January 20, 2017  She assumed the role of first lady of the United States on January 20, 2017.[86][87] She continued living in Manhattan at the Trump Tower with their son, Barron, until the end of his 2016–2017 school year at Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School.[88][89] They moved into the White House in Washington, D.C., on June 11, 2017.[90] Her Secret Service code name is ""Muse"" (beginning with the same letter as Trump's code name, ""Mogul"", per Secret Service tradition).[91] Her staff of 13 (as of January 2018) is smaller than that of the two previous first ladies after one year of their husbands' administration.[92]  She is the second foreign-born woman to hold the title of first lady, after Louisa Adams, wife of John Quincy Adams, who was born in 1775 in London to a father from Maryland and an English mother.[93][94] She is also the first naturalized citizen (rather than birthright citizen) to hold the title, and the first whose native language is not English.[95]  French President Macron greets Melania by kissing her hand, 2018  On March 8, 2017, she hosted her first White House event, a luncheon for International Women's Day. She spoke to an audience of women about her life as a female immigrant, and about working towards gender equality both domestically and abroad, noting the role of education as a tool against gender inequality.[96][97][98]  In January 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that during a three-month period where she lived in New York in 2017, she took Air Force jet flights between New York City, Florida and Washington at a cost of more than $675,000 to taxpayers.[99][100] In comparison, former first lady Michelle Obama's solo travel cost an average of about $350,000 a year.[99][100]  On March 13, 2018, Trump scheduled a March 20 meeting with policy executives from technology companies, including Amazon, Facebook, Google, Snap, and Twitter, to address online harassment and Internet safety, with a particular focus on how those issues affect children.[101] Trump's office has avoided the use of the term ""cyberbullying,""[101] and Trump has come under criticism for championing Internet civility while her husband's Internet behavior has been noted as uncivil.[101][102] Trump attended the roundtable event, focusing on how children are affected by modern technology. Trump said: ""I am well aware that people are skeptical of me discussing this topic,"" but ""that will not stop me from doing what I know is right.""[103]  Melania took an active role in planning the Trump administration's first state dinner on April 23, 2018, to honor French president Emmanuel Macron.[104] With Brigitte Macron, the French president's wife, Trump visited a Paul Cézanne exhibit at the National Gallery of Art in Washington the day before.[105][106][107]  Melania Trump express her condolences to the family of El Paso shooting victims Jordan and Andre Anchondo on August 7, 2019  In October 2018, Trump took a four-country, solo tour of Africa, without her husband, focusing on conservation and children and families, visiting Ghana, Malawi, Kenya, and Egypt.[108]  The Trumps at the announcement of the First Lady's Be Best initiative, May 2018  On November 13, 2018, Trump issued an ""extraordinary"" public statement calling for the firing of Deputy National Security Advisor Mira Ricardel. She had reportedly been privately pushing for Ricardel's ouster for weeks. The next day it was announced that Ricardel would ""transition to a new role within the Administration.""[109] It was described as unusual for a first lady to be publicly involved in White House personnel decisions.[110]  During the El Paso shooting in Texas on August 3, 2019, a lone gunman killed 23 people and injured 23 others. Melania and President Trump visited the hospital where eight of the survivors were being cared for. The president and first lady met with the families of survivors, hospital staff and first responders, and posed with a baby who had been orphaned when both of his parents were killed. The White House had asked that the child be brought in and he was accompanied by his uncle.[111][112][113]  During the 2020 State of the Union Address, President Trump awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Rush Limbaugh, who was seated beside Melania in the gallery. She presented the medal to Limbaugh.[114][115]  Be Best campaign  On May 7, 2018, Trump formally started the Be Best public awareness campaign, which focused on well-being for youth and advocated against cyberbullying and drug use.[116] The campaign was accompanied by a booklet that was promoted as having been written ""By First Lady Melania Trump and the Federal Trade Commission [FTC]"", but it was nearly identical to a document prepared in 2014 by the FTC.[117] The similarities prompted accusations of plagiarism, to which her office responded by admonishing the press for reporting on the issue.[118] The fact-checking site Snopes found the charge of plagiarism ""Mostly False"" saying, ""Melania Trump did not claim she had written the pamphlet herself, and she contributed an introduction to a slightly revised version of the booklet. The FTC was always credited for the creation of the booklet and supported its inclusion in the first lady's 'Be Best' campaign.""[119]  Immigration  Melania, President Trump and other world leaders attend the D-Day commemorations on June 5, 2019  On June 17, 2018, Melania referred to the Trump administration's ""Zero Tolerance"" policy at the border with Mexico, where children were being separated from their parents. She stated that she ""hates to see children separated from their families"" and wants there to be ""successful immigration reform.""[120] On June 21, she made a hastily planned trip to Texas to one of the locations at which the Trump Administration's family separation policy was being carried out. She attended a roundtable with doctors, medical staff, social workers and other experts at Upbring New Hope Children's Shelter.[121]  Fashion  Vogue magazine compared Trump's wardrobe as first lady to that of Jacqueline Kennedy and Nancy Reagan, noting that Trump closely works with her stylist, designer Hervé Pierre, preferring ""strongly tailored pieces"" in bold colors and wearing almost exclusively high-end designers.[122][123]  Personal life  Religion  When the president and first lady visited Vatican City in May 2017, she identified as Catholic. She is the first Catholic to live in the White House since President John F. Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline and is the second Catholic first lady of the United States.[124][125] When she visited the Vatican, Pope Francis blessed her rosary beads, and she placed flowers at the feet of a statue of Mary at the Vatican's children's hospital.[126]  Melania and Donald Trump were married at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church.[127][128][129] Their son Barron was baptized there as well.[130]  Health  On May 14, 2018, she underwent an embolization, which is a minimally invasive procedure that deliberately blocks a blood vessel,[131] in order to treat a benign kidney condition. The procedure was reported successful and there were no reported complications.[132]  Cultural depictions",real

810,"President Donald Trump tweeted Wednesday that Kathy Griffin “should be ashamed” for her latest work, a controversial photograph that featured the comedian holding a bloody, decapitated head meant to invoke Trump himself.  “Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  The photograph of Griffin, taken by provocative image creator Tyler Shields, went viral on Tuesday and was quickly denounced by both Trump supporters and detractors, including Chelsea Clinton and Debra Messing, among others.  After first defending the photo, Griffin issued an apology late Wednesday. “I sincerely apologize. I am just now seeing the reaction of these images. I’m a comic. I crossed the line. I move the line, then I cross it. I went way too far. The image is too disturbing. I understand how it offends people. It wasn’t funny. I get it.  Griffin added, “I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my career. I will continue. I ask for your forgiveness. [I’m] taking down the image, going to ask the photographer to take down the image. And I beg for your forgiveness. I went too far, I made a mistake, and I was wrong.”",fake

The 17-year-old won with a score of 98.25 on her final run with China's Jiayu Liu taking silver and United States' Arielle Gold winning bronze.  Kim had already secured gold with her first run score but improved to win by eight-and-a-half points.  She is one of the stars of the Games and a favourite with the home fans due to her South Korean parents.  ""It means a lot just being able to do it where my family is from,"" Kim said after her win which was watched by the biggest crowd so far at Pyeongchang's Phoenix Snow Park.  ""There was a lot of pressure, but I'm happy I was able to do it here and do it for the fans and the family.

Why are teenagers so good at snowboarding? 17-year-old Red Gerard's gold in the slopestyle was no surprise to those who follow the sport. How youngsters have started to dominate the slopes  Breathtaking after breakfast  BBC Sport commentator Ed Leigh said we might be looking at ""the beginning of a very long reign for the queen of halfpipe snowboarding"".  The Californian was the strong favourite ahead of the Games and that status was strengthened when she qualified with a score of 91.50, almost four better than any of her rivals.  The gold is Kim's first Olympic medal at her debut Games. She qualified for the 2014 Games in Sochi but was unable to compete as she was aged just 13.  The teenager was the last to take to the course in the first run and immediately moved top of the standings with a score of 93.75.  She fell on her second run but no rider was able to better her initial effort meaning the American was already guaranteed gold before her final run.  Kim even took to Twitter during the competition to discuss her breakfast.  Her US team-mate and snowboard legend Shaun White qualified first in the men's halfpipe ahead of the final on Wednesday at 01:30 GMT.  Who is Pyeongchang's 'queen'?  Kim's victory was celebrated like a win for home nation South Korea at the snow park  Kim's parents emigrated from South Korea to the US in 1982 and she first tried the sport aged four.  Despite her age she has dominated the sport in recent years, becoming the youngest person to win three X Games gold medals.  At just 15 she became the first female snowboarder to land back-to-back 1080 degree spins in competition, a trick she repeated on her third run in Pyeongchang.  The teenager has a large following on social media and a tweet between her qualification runs went viral as she expressed her need for ice cream.  In her news conference following her win Kim said ""I'm so hungry. I really want a burger or fries or maybe some pizza"".  Thousands of Twitter users congratulated her following the win, causing her name to trend on the network.  There was more than double the number of tweets including her name in the hours after her win than those featuring her compatriots and fellow snowboard gold medal winners Red Gerard and Jamie Anderson combined after their wins earlier in the Games.

16189,"American attorney and businessman  This article is about the attorney. For his son, the television personality, see Rob Kardashian  Robert George Kardashian (February 22, 1944 – September 30, 2003) was an American attorney and businessman. He gained national recognition as O. J. Simpson's friend and defense attorney during Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He had four children with his first wife, Kris Kardashian (née Houghton, later Jenner): Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Rob, who appear on their family reality television series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and its spinoffs.  Early life  Kardashian was born in Los Angeles, California. He has a sister and brother, Barbara and Tom Kardashian.[2][3] His great-grandparents, Saghatel (""Sam"") and Harom Kardaschoff, were ethnic Armenian Spiritual Christian Prygun[4] immigrants from Karakale (now: Merkezkarakale), Kars Oblast of the Russian Empire (now Kars Province in Turkey). The family, known at the time by the surname Kardaschoff, in Russian style, made their way from their home village of Karakale probably to Bremerhaven, Germany, a popular emigration port. From there, they traveled to a new life in America. Their son Tatos anglicized his name to Tom, started a business in garbage collection in Los Angeles, and married another Kars-Karakale immigrant, Hamas Shakarian.[citation needed]  Growing up in the Baldwin Hills area of Los Angeles, Kardashian attended Susan Miller Dorsey High School and the University of Southern California, from which he graduated in 1966 with a B.S. degree in business administration.[5] He earned a J.D. degree from the University of San Diego School of Law and practiced for about a decade; after that, he went into business. In 1973, Kardashian was one of the co-founders of the trade publication Radio & Records, which he and his partners sold for a large profit in 1979.[5] Kardashian also pioneered the idea of playing music between movies in theaters. He subsequently parlayed the concept into a business, starting a company called Movie Tunes.[6][7][8][9] He served as President and CEO of the firm and later invested in Juice Inc., a frozen yogurt company, and in a music video business called Concert Cinema.[10][11]  O. J. Simpson case  Kardashian and Simpson first met around 1967 while both of them were at USC and became close friends.[12] Simpson was the best man at Robert Kardashian and Kris Jenner's wedding in 1978. Robert was the water boy for the USC Trojans football team which would be ranked #1 in the nation in the AP Poll.[citation needed]  Following the June 12, 1994, murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, Simpson stayed in Kardashian's house to avoid the media. Kardashian was the man seen carrying Simpson's garment bag the day that Simpson flew back from Chicago. Prosecutors speculated that the bag may have contained Simpson's bloody clothes or the murder weapon.[13] When Simpson failed to turn himself in at 11 a.m. on June 17, 1994, Kardashian read a letter by Simpson to the assembled media. This letter was interpreted by many as a suicide note.[14]  Simpson was charged with the murders and subsequently acquitted of all criminal charges in a controversial criminal trial. Kardashian had let his license to practice law become inactive before the Simpson case but reactivated it to aid in Simpson's defense as a volunteer assistant on his legal team, alongside Simpson's main defense attorneys, Robert Shapiro and Johnnie Cochran. As one of Simpson's lawyers and a member of the defense ""Dream Team"", Kardashian could not be compelled or subpoenaed to testify against Simpson in the case, which included Simpson's past history and behavior with his ex-wife Nicole, and as to the contents of Simpson's garment bag.[15] He sat by Simpson throughout the trial.[16]  The New York Times reported that Kardashian said in a 1996 ABC interview with Barbara Walters that he had begun to question Simpson's innocence: ""I have doubts. The blood evidence is the biggest thorn in my side; that causes me the greatest problems. So I struggle with the blood evidence.""[15] Kardashian and Simpson ultimately stopped speaking to each other.  Illness and death  Kardashian was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in July 2003. He died two months later, on September 30, 2003, at age 59,[17] and was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.[18]  In popular culture  Kardashian was portrayed by David Schwimmer in the 2016 FX miniseries American Crime Story: The People v. O. J. Simpson. Schwimmer was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his performance, but lost to Sterling K. Brown, who portrayed Christopher Darden in the same series. In 2016, ESPN Films and their 30 for 30 series produced a five-part miniseries called O.J.: Made in America, produced by Ezra Edelman, in which Kardashian was featured heavily through archive footage.  In 2017, Kardashian was the subject of the pilot episode of the TV comedy series Over My Dead Body on Amazon Prime.[19]  Personal life  Kardashian had four children with his first wife, Kris Kardashian (née Houghton, subsequently Jenner): Kourtney, Kimberly, Khloé, and Rob.[20]  Shortly after separating from his first wife in 1991, Kardashian became engaged to Denice Shakarian Halicki, widow of movie producer H.B. Halicki.[21][22] The couple never married. In 1998, Kardashian married Jan Ashley; however, the marriage ended in annulment 30 days later. Ashley later claimed frequent upset and turmoil related to Kardashian's ex-wife Kris and their children ""were instrumental"" in the demise of the relationship.[23][24][25] After dating for three years and proposing in 2001, Kardashian married his third wife, Ellen Pierson (née Markowitz), six weeks prior to his death.[26][16]  See also",real

17294,"🚨 Spoilers for Westworld Season 2 Episode 1, ""Journey Into Night,"" below. 🚨  This content is imported from {embed-name}. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  Westworld is back for round two, which means the next several months will largely consist of you getting into arguments on Reddit and feeling extremely uncomfortable about Sophia the Robot's presence in your Twitter feed. But before we jump into Season 2, Episode 1, let's go over where we left off with the Season 1 finale:  Dolores shot Dr. Ford at a party celebrating his final narrative. Said party was filled with Delos employees, whoops.  At the same time, Maeve's robot rebellion began—and the Man in Black was shot in the arm.  Maeve made what appears to be her first sentient decision, opting to stay in the park to find her daughter.  Teddy, Bernard, and presumably the rest of the robots are in the nascent steps of self-realization. (Remember, the order is Memory > Improvisation > Consciousness.)  A note about this episode's timeline: The Season 2 premiere seems to take place during two time periods. The first is the present day; it follows Bernard hooking up with Delos' tech team, features weird flashbacks that show Dolores in modern-day garb, and ends with Bernard admitting to killing all the hosts. The second is two weeks prior, in the immediate aftermath of the board gala massacre. This is where the majority of the episode takes place.  Real quick, here's a side-by-side of Bernard's differing looks between two weeks ago and present day. Why he changed outfits is unclear, but this is a helpful identifier if you ever find yourself confused about which Bernard you're watching.  Left: Bernard two weeks ago; Right: Bernard present day. HBO  Without further ado, let's get to the recap.  PRESENT DAY  We learn Westworld's location.  The Westworld premiere begins with Bernard (wearing a gray suit) lying on the beach surrounded by bodies. Based on the length the park's been ""offline,"" it's been about two weeks since Maeve and Dolores' robot rebellion.  Bernard appears disoriented and confused as he's carted off by Stubbs (hi, Stubbs, long time no see!) and a very serious-looking SWAT team to meet Delos' Head of Operations, Karl Strand (Gustaf Skarsgård). He's arguing about jurisdiction with a group of soldiers speaking Chinese.  This implies that Westworld is an island in Asia, which falls in line with a fascinating discovery a Reddit user made in 2016: That Westworld's Finnish subtitles show the park's map coordinates, and places it in the Spratly Islands—a disputed group of islands in the South China Sea that are occupied by military forces from Malaysia, Taiwan, China, the Philippines, and Vietnam.  Coordinates found in the Finnish Westworld subtitles. HBO/Reddit  If Westworld exists in this cluster of islands, it stands to reason that the rest of Delos' parks do as well. Either way, Delos' Head of Operations announces that there are search and rescue teams at the ""rest of the parks."" Does this mean Dolores and Maeve's rebellion has crossed park borders? The appearance of a Bengal tiger from Park 6 towards the end of the episode certainly implies that borders have been breeched.  Something weird is going on with the maze imprinted on the hosts' scalps.  Remember last season when The Man in Black discovered a maze drawing on the underside of Kissy's scalp?  HBO  In this episode, the maze drawing is discovered once again after technician Antoine Costa (Fares Fares) opens up a host's head. And while the man in the middle of the maze on both Kissy's head and this new host's head both have their arms outstretched, the man in the maze Dolores discovers has one arm facing in—to his head.  Left: The scalp from Season 2, Episode 1. Right: Dolores’ maze toy. HBO  I'm of the belief that nothing in Westworld is an accident, and the show wouldn't remind us of this whole scalp-maze-thing if there wasn't a good reason. Is it possible that Ford secretly placed this pattern on the host's scalp, and that once they achieve the Bicameral Mind one arm moves towards the brain—indicating partial consciousness? I'm not sure, but pay attention to the nuances of this drawing going forward. People tend to argue about it a lot on Reddit, so if you're interested in that fun time, head over here.  We learn the hosts record video of everything.  Turns out the hosts' ""brains"" are essentially a baseball-sized camera floating in a pool of fluid surrounded by metal. We don't know much about how the system works just yet, but we do learn the hosts are recording everything. In the case of the host who gets scalped by Delos tech, the camera recorded footage of his death-by-Dolores, who clearly isn't interested in saving her robot buddies and can be heard saying, ""Not all of us deserve to make it to the valley beyond.""  HBO  Note: Is it possible that Dolores is aware that repeat trauma is key to ""waking up"" the rest of her kind? Maybe she's just doing this dude a solid to get the process started.    Bernard killed hundreds of hosts, but why?  The last image of the episode is Bernard and Team Delos standing by a previously non-existent lake filled with the bodies of dead hosts—including what appears to be Teddy.  HBO  Bernard then announces he killed all the hosts. This raises several questions, the most obvious being, how did that lake get there and why would Bernard kill his fellow hosts? My personal theory is that Bernard hooked up with Dolores at some point post-Ford's death, and she encouraged him to slaughter the hosts she didn't find worthy of reaching the ""valley beyond.""  TWO WEEKS AGO  Bernard discovers a secret Delos underground lab.  A brief summary of Bernard's movements post-Ford's death: After a massacre of all their Delos Board buds, he and Charlotte Hale manage to escape to a secret lab that Bernard doesn't know about. While there, Bernard suffers a near critical break, but manages to save himself by injecting another host's brain fluid into his neck. Bernard is wearing a black suit during these scenes.  Some things to note:  1) There's a new type of robot we've never met.  Meet the Drone Host, a faceless robot whose sole purpose seems to be extracting camera footage from hosts, tracking human experiences in the park, and stealing human DNA. This is apparently part of Delos' yet-to-be-revealed master plan.  HBO  The Drone Host doesn't seem to recognize Bernard as a fellow host or a threat, and furthermore, the lab door recognizes his DNA and allows him to enter. We know Bernard doesn't have human DNA, so I'm inclined to think Ford re-jiggered the system to allow Bernard in, and his infiltration of the lab is A) part of Ford's new pre-written narrative, and B) a way for him to posthumously f*ck with Delos.  2) It's clear Bernard is malfunctioning, but why?  Last season, Felix Lutz informed us that a bullet had damaged an important part of Bernard's robot brain, and his leaking fluid certainly indicates a technical injury. But my question is—and please bear with me because this is somewhat complicated—how far out into the future did Ford program Bernard, or even his narrative as a whole? What happens to a robot if the person secretly programming their every move dies? Did Ford plan out Bernard's movements and decisions post-rebellion? And if not, is it possible that since Bernard isn't fully conscious yet, he's finding it hard to function without a puppet master?  HBO  3) We learn the Drone Hosts are ""off network""—so who is controlling them?    The hosts are largely being driven by Ford's new rebellion narrative, but during this episode we learn the drone hosts are ""off network."" So, are they currently the only hosts immune from said narrative? I'd normally say yes, but the fact that Bernard was allowed into the laboratory makes me think Ford's reach has potentially extended to this area as well.  HBO  4) The mesh network could change everything.  While Bernard helps Charlotte track down Abernathy (more on him in a sec) we discover the existence of a ""mesh network""—a ""subconscious link"" that allows hosts to contact and exchange information with each other—akin to ants communicating in a colony. If there is a human vs. robot war, the fact that robots have what appears to be a hive mind definitely seems like a bonus.    We finally know what's up with Abernathy  Wondering why Delos took an entire two weeks to rescue everyone inside Westworld? Because of one Peter Abernathy. During Charlotte and Bernard's time in the lab, Charlotte sends a distress call to Delos, who refuse to begin rescue procedures until they have a ""package."" That package = Abernathy, whom, you might recall, Hale and Sizemore uploaded with years worth of Delos data. We haven't caught up with Abernathy as of yet, but Reddit has a fascinating theory that Ford viewed him as a vessel he could upload his own personality into, thus living on forever. Read more about that here.  Dolores is on a killing spree and she's FULLY conscious  Dolores and Teddy are now Westworld's version of Bonnie and Clyde, and from what I can tell, they spent the immediate aftermath of Ford's death killing people; Dolores specifically spent a lot of time giving speeches about how conscious she is. Most significantly, she muses, ""I've evolved into something new and I have one last role to play: myself.""  Giphy  Dolores also seems to be infatuated with a very confused Teddy (bless him), and they share a romantic moment in which Dolores casually announces her plan for world domination. Assuming this scene took place shortly after Dolores killed Ford, it's possible she and Teddy will leave the park in future episodes (more on that in a minute).  The Man in Black has a new game to play.  Good news: The Man in Black survived the host massacre, and he meets and kills Ford's robotic child incarnation soon after—but not before said child tells him to find ""the door"" as part of a new game. Honestly, The Man in Black's life seems exhausting, but what's really relevant here is that Child Ford now has what appears to be the glitchy voice of Adult Ford, indicating that Westworld's genius mastermind found a way to live on forever after all.  Maeve is back, Hector's alive, and Lee Sizemore is the worst.  HBO  Maeve's storyline is probably the most linear and easy to understand at this point in Season 2: Basically, she makes her way back into the Delos labs to discover everyone's been slaughtered, meets up with Hector, finds a very traumatized Lee Sizemore, and they all set off to find Maeve's daughter—who still lives in the family-friendly homestead area of the park.  THE...FUTURE? MAYBE?  Towards the beginning of the episode we see footage of Bernard holding a rapid-fire gun in the Delos labs (the same kind Maeve and Hector killed all the techs with) and we also see Dolores in a modern-black dress. I'd argue that they're (maybe!) both flash-forwards.  While it's certainly possible that A) this footage exists in the two-week period between Dolores' rebellion and the Delos swat team's arrival, or B) the footage of Dolores takes place in the distant 35-years-ago past, I think it's possible that Westworld set up a new timeline for us: the future.  We know the show loves itself a confusing and non-linear narrative, and references to the future were big during this episode—especially during Dolores' speech to Teddy when she says, ""I see it all now so clearly: the past, the present, the future. I know how this story ends. With us, Teddy.""  HBO  We also need to discuss the very first scene in the show, which I initially assumed was a flashback to a circa 35-years-ago conversation between Arnold and Dolores, in which the former describes a dream about Dolores + Water + Hosts.  HBO  After watching the full episode, it seems possible that Arnold is potentially referencing what takes place later in the episode (the death of multiple hosts in a body of water). My theory? This is actually a scene from the future, between Bernard and Dolores, who has been re-programed to remember nothing.

4352,"Can music fans expect an amazing ""Starboy""/""Swish Swish"" mashup sometime soon? Katy Perry and The Weeknd recently had dinner together, according to multiple sources. But since the two singers are both currently single — with Perry's breakup from Orlando Bloom and The Weeknd recently splitting from Selena Gomez — could this dinner date be a sign of anything more than a friendship or a possible collaboration going on between the two?  Sources including Glamour UK and Vogue, reported that the two singers had a fashionable dinner date. According to The Sun's report, Perry and The Weeknd, aka Abel Tesfaye, dined together in West Hollywood and apparently had a great time with each other. They then reportedly went home separately. The Sun's report suggests that the date between the pair was romantic and not just a dinner between friends, but take that with a grain of salt. Not only are there are no details available from the singers themselves, but other publications are reporting that they simply got dinner, no romance involved.  While many sources have reported on this dinner between Perry and The Weeknd, most outlets have yet to report anything regarding a potential relationship between the pair. Sorry to burst the bubble of any Katy Perry and The Weeknd shippers, but it's probably just a rumor that the two are dating — at least right now.  Christopher Polk/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  The Weeknd has found himself linked to a couple of different women after his breakup with Gomez, and it's not likely that he's actually dating every single person he'e seen with. On Nov. 11, Us Weekly reported that he was seen holding hands with Yovanna Ventura, who was previously linked to Justin Bieber, who is currently dating his ex-girlfriend (and The Weeknd's ex-girlfriend, for that matter) Gomez. According to an Us Weekly source, ""[The Weeknd] was trying to make it obvious that he was with someone. They were pretty affectionate and were together the whole night.""  There were also reports that The Weeknd was back in contact with his ex-girlfriend Bella Hadid. Although they reportedly haven't gotten back together romantically, People reported on Nov. 17 that ""He is talking to Bella a lot and they've hung out too."" The Weeknd and Hadid apparently ""still love each other"" and are seeing where things go with them, according to E!. It was also reported by Hollywood Life that he sent Hadid flowers before the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show ""with a sweet note"". The abundance of rumors surrounding The Weeknd's love life, show that romance rumors might be quick to catch-on whenever he's seen hanging out with anyone, as in the case with Perry.  Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Romance rumors surrounding the ""Starboy"" singer have been abundant ever since he and fellow singer Gomez were reported to have broken up. According to E!, the two singers dated for 10 months before they called it quits in late October. The split was reportedly amicable and it had nothing to do with Gomez hanging out with her ex. A source said, ""The relationship was basically over before Justin Bieber and Selena hung out."" It wasn't long after those two lovebirds' reunion hit the headlines. But, since it doesn't sound as though there wasn't any bad blood with that breakup, it's likely that The Weeknd is just focusing on doing his own thing.  Does his own thing involve Katy Perry? Probably not in a romantic way. Until the two singers confirm anything about a potential relationship, it's more likely that they are just two friends hanging out and possibly making some fans' pop dreams come true.",fake

Currently in its 18th week of release, it's also only one of two albums from last year to sell more than one million copies, Ed Sheeran's ÷ being the other, according to Nielsen tracking figures. Reputation hit the milestone in its first week of release, selling 1.2 million copies.  All of Swift's six previous studio albums - 1989, Red, Speak Now, Fearless, and Taylor Swift - sold more than two million copies.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  However, Forbes pointed out that, interestingly, it took significantly longer for Reputation to hit that phenomenal milestone. In fact, longer than Swift's past three albums combined.  2014's 1989 hit 2 million during its third week of release, 2012's Red during its fifth week of release, and 2010's Speak Now during its sixth week. Even 2008's Fearless took only seven weeks to pass 2 million sales.  Swift’s 50-plus-stop stadium tour will commence on 8 May.

1503,"It’s safe to assume Caitlyn Jenner didn’t accidentally forget to shout out Khloe Kardashian in her Mother’s Day post. She even included ex-wife Kris Jenner.  “So blessed to have so many amazing moms in my life!” the 68-year-old Olympian gushed in her Instagram Stories on Sunday, May 13. Pictures included a never-before-seen image of daughter Kylie Jenner cradling her baby girl Stormi and a snap of Caitlyn hugging Kris. Though Caitlyn revealed in November 2017 that she hasn’t spoken to Kim Kardashian in a year, she shared a selfie of herself with the reality star, 37, and grandson Saint.  Khloe’s social media snub comes after a February interview with U.K. morning show Lorraine, where she opened up about her estranged relationship with Caitlyn. When the then-pregnant 33-year-old was asked if having a child would mend her estranged relationship with Caitlyn, she replied: “I don’t think that affects anything with Caitlyn. Things are just as they are.” (Khloe welcomed daughter, True, on April 12, with boyfriend Tristan Thompson.)  Jenner’s relationship with the Kardashian family has been rocky since April 2015 when she revealed her identity as a transgender woman. In her memoir, The Secrets of My Life, Caitlyn claimed that Kris, 62, was not supportive of her transition. Their divorce was finalized in 2015 after 24 years of marriage.  “I’ve lost all relationship with them, yes, I don’t talk to any of them anymore,” Caitlyn told Piers Morgan in 2017. At the time, the former athlete revealed she hadn’t spoken to Khloe in two years.  While it is unlikely the Good American denim designer will respond to Caitlyn’s diss, she did share her own Mother’s day tribute to Kris on Instagram on Sunday. May 13.

About SeeHer  Despite strides made in recent years to accurately portray women and girls in media, unconscious bias persists throughout advertising and entertainment. The average age, race, and body type of women depicted in media today still represents only a small fraction of the female population. Led by the Association of National Advertisers (ANA), SeeHer is a collective of leading marketers committed to creating advertising and supporting content that portrays women and girls as they really are. It launched in June 2016 in partnership with The Female Quotient (The FQ) in Washington DC at the United State of Women. To help marketers benchmark success, the group developed Gender Equality MeasureTM, GEMTM, the first research methodology that quantifies gender bias in ads and programming. GEMTM shows that content portraying females accurately dramatically increases purchase intent and brand reputation, increasing return on investment (ROI) by as much as 30 percent. GEMTM won the prestigious 2017 ESOMAR Research Effectiveness Award, and the methodology became the industry standard, which led to a global rollout in 2018. In 2019 the movement expanded into new verticals including sports (#SeeHerInSports) and music (#SeeHerHearHer.)  Visit SeeHer.com and follow us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter @SeeHer2020.

106,"Meghan Markle may now be officially known as the Duchess of Sussex, but to her friends, she's still just ""Meg""  'I'm Always Going to Be Meg': The Sweet Thing Meghan Markle Told Makeup Artist Pal Before Wedding  Meghan Markle may now be officially known as the Duchess of Sussex, but to her friends, she’s still just “Meg.”  Makeup artist Daniel Martin — the creative consultant for Honest Beauty, Dior Beauty brand ambassador and a longtime friend of Meghan’s who helped her achieve the perfect beauty look for her wedding day — tells PEOPLE that even he was confused as to what to call her after she was married to Prince Harry.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I asked her that. ‘Do I bow to you? I don’t want to disrespect you, but I’ve known for almost ten years. What’s up?'” he recalls. “She started laughing and she said, ‘I’m always going to be Meg. Meg.'”  Martin added, “But next time I see them I will be respectful and know my protocol. But Meg is always going to be Meg, that’s how it is!”  Watch our full special, Meghan and Harry – a Fairy-Tale Wedding, on PeopleTV, now available on PeopleTV.com and on your favorite streaming device.  Martin says there were just five people around while prepping Meghan for her walk down the aisle: the bride, himself, hair stylist Serge Normant, dress designer Clare Waight Keller and Meghan’s mom Doria Ragland, who Martin said was “in good spirits.” The atmosphere was very relaxed, partly thanks to Meghan playing “1950s, chilled music” via Spotify.  “She didn’t seem nervous. She was very cool, she was regular Meghan,” the makeup artist shares. “I think we were nervous, but we didn’t want to make her nervous so it was very chilled. Of course, brides have nerves, but if we didn’t put so much expectation on it, it wouldn’t have made her nervous. It was very even, very easy.”  Martin added that the bride stayed off her phone as they caught up by talking about mutual friends.  Despite all their beauty work, putting on the wedding dress really made the moment feel real.  “It was all so easy. It didn’t hit us that she was getting married until she got the dress on,” Martin said.  He added, “It was so beautiful and so architectural, and when she put it on it was like a glove. It was so easy. The spectacle of the veil and the crown and it was, ‘Oh my goodness, this is really happening.’ ”  RELATED VIDEO: Harry and Meghan’s Love Story  That feeling intensified when they arrived at Windsor Castle.  “Nothing really hit any of us until we got there and we saw the people and the magnitude of everything,” he said. “The last thing we said to each other was, ‘We’ll see you on the other side.’ ”  Image zoom Meghan Markle Brian Lawless - WPA Pool/Getty  Image zoom Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Mark R.

4780,"Ben Affleck has apparently pushed Jennifer Garner to seek refuge in the Church of Scientology.  After living apart for two years, Affleck and Garner decided to go their separate ways.  The actors were married for 12 years and have three children together – 11-year-old Violet, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5.  Very rapidly, Affleck revealed to the world that he was in a serious relationship with Lindsay Shookus.  Rumors are claiming the movie maker and his new lady secretly started dating in 2012.  Affleck has been seen on romantic dinner dates with the Saturday Night Live producer, and the pair has moved into a home together.  A source has come out to say; Garner is feeling lonely and abandoned by the father of her children who has found a new love.  A friend explained: “Jen is hurt and humiliated by Ben’s very public romance.”  The chatty insider added: “Jen has never been about getting retribution. That is not her style. But Ben’s insensitive actions have changed her. She could never really trust Ben. He is no longer hiding his relationship with girlfriend Lindsay, and Jen has hit a breaking point.”  According to Star, Garner has turned to the Church of Scientology for help.  The famous actress has been feeling tired, going through sleepless nights, and is hoping that Tom Cruise’s controversial church will help her get back on her feet.  Garner is allegedly doing therapy and trying other alternative techniques that can help her mental state and physical well-being.  A person on her team claimed that the story is not true and that Garner regularly attends the Community United Methodist Church.  This is not the first time, Garner has been linked to Church of Scientology.  Andrew Morton, author of Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography, claimed in 2004, Garner and an extensive list of Hollywood stunners were contacted by the action movie star to be his wife.  Morton wrote: “Cruise left messages on the Alias star’s voice mail in 2004 asking “if she knew what freedom was,” but his advances were rebuffed .. Katie Holmes accepted the offer and signed a contract to commit to Scientology and that her father brokered a high-paying prenup.”  Advertisement  It is conceivable that after a major breakup, Garner is looking for answers where she can find them.",fake

The ex-NYPD cop described how he witnessed the rap superstar lord over his underlings, before he finally got fired for introducing himself to West’s wife, Kim Kardashian, The Sun reported.  “I had to look after his toddler daughter once and it was so much easier than baby-sitting the father,” said bodyguard to the stars Steve Stanulis, whose past clients include Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire.  “I’ve been employed by a lot of high-end people but I’ve never worked for someone like him. He’s 10 times worse than what you see.”  Stanulis, 42, who only worked for West for two weeks, recalled a career’s worth of West’s diva antics.  “I was told, ‘Don’t expect to last long. He goes through a lot of guys and some don’t even last the first hour’.”  On his very first day, Stanulis got a taste of West’s pampered antics.  “We headed to his music studio. When we got into the elevator Kanye just stood there with his arms folded and said, ‘Aren’t you going to press the button?’”  Stanulis explained he didn’t know which floor.  “[Kanye] flipped out, squealing that his time was precious and that he couldn’t believe I hadn’t called ahead to find out which floor he worked on.”  “I was amazed by the amount of bizarre behavior I saw in just two weeks,” said Stanulis. “It is his world and everyone just exists within it. I don’t know how Kim [Kardashian] stays married to him.”  Almost anything could set the erratic rapper off.  “He got annoyed because I ‘got in his shot’ once when the paparazzi were taking pictures,” Stanulis said.  Stanulis also recalled being sent out to retrieve West after “The Life of Pablo” MC stormed out of his music studio in a rage.  The bodyguard used his personal car — and West balked at having to maneuver past the childrens’ car seats in the rear of the vehicle.  “I told him he could get in or keep on walking — and after a sulk he climbed in the front.”  West also ordered Stanulis to never speak to his wife, after spotting the guard introducing himself to her in New York. He fired Stanulis on the night of the Met Gala, earlier this month, when he saw Stanulis standing in a hallway with Kardashian.  “He is the most condescending person I have ever met,” Stanulis said.",fake

And six years after their three-year relationship came crashing down over reports that Stewart was cheating on Pattinson with married director Rupert Sanders, rumors have been swirling that the two are considering a reconciliation.  CLICK HERE if you are having trouble viewing the photo gallery on your mobile device.  This is all according to the Daily Mail, which published grainy photos of Stewart and Pattinson, looking like they were having a chill time together, hanging out by a car outside a party at Chateau Marmont for Lily-Rose Depp.  Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart – OUTSIDE OF THE CHATEAU MARMONT, LA 06/02/2018 pic.twitter.com/yozZSAGSIw — Elishia (@multifandomacc5) June 3, 2018  Stewart, 28, was wearing a black ensemble and appeared to be smoking, while Pattinson, 32, was wearing jeans, a graphic T-shrirt and black cap.  The idea of the “Twilight’s” Bella and Edward reconciling romantically in real life seems improbable because of the high-profile humiliation Pattinson likely suffered when Stewart was caught in a cheating scandal.  She was photographed in an intimate embrace with Sanders, her director for “Snow White and the Huntsman,” who was 19 years her senior. She and Sanders issued a very public apology to Pattinson.  When the Twilight series ended in 2012, Stewart and Pattinson seemed to go their separate ways both professionally and romantically.  Each has earned critical praise and International awards consideration for leaving blockbuster fare behind and starring in smaller, indie films. Meanwhile, Stewart came out as bisexual and began seriously dating model Stella Maxwell in late 2016, while Pattinson became engaged to U.K. singer FKA Twigs.  But Pattinson’s engagement to Twigs reportedly ended in October, while the Daily Mail, citing a report in OK! magazine, said “there’s trouble in paradise,” with regards to Stewart and Maxwell’s relationship.  In April, the Twilight stars were reported to have “gotten together a few times over the past several weeks,” according to OK!  “They’re trying to keep it low-key, but there’s still chemistry there,” a source told OK! “People in their circles are starting to wonder if they’re considering a reconciliation.”  Supposedly, Stewart hopes Pattinson is “serious” about having forgiven her, an insider told OK!

So it is with television personality Caitlyn Jenner. It seems Caitlyn is not holding back in showering her girlfriend, Sophia Hutchins with love and gifts.  According to Radar Online, she is reportedly secretly spending $50,000 a week on Sophia. Even though it hasn't been a year since they started dating, Caitlyn is making sure that Sophia has everything she wants. “Caitlyn is spending an absolute fortune on Sophia,” a source told the website.  “She’s constantly treating her to drinks and dinners at the nicest restaurants in town and buys her jewelry and handbags all the time!” the source continued. At the same time, it has been reported that Caitlyn has given Sophia her own credit card along with a weekly allowance. “Sophia is using Caitlyn’s cash to deck out her wardrobe with designer clothes and get her hair and nails done every week,"" the source revealed.  Spilling more details on the duo's relationship, the insider observed how Sophia has been more than happy to indulge in facials and massages and even though this weird arrangement is costing Caitlyn at least $50,000 each week, she seems desperate for Sophia to stick around and this is her way of sealing the deal. Rumors became fortified when they were first spotted together holidaying in Cabo, Mexico.  The Mirror reported that the pair is head over heels in love with each other and plans on settling down. The tabloid reported that the 47-year age gap between them does not seem to cause any issue as the duo plans on getting married in an intimate ceremony at Caitlyn's home in Malibu.

She has also lost friends in the LGBT community because of her political views [backing Donald Trump],"" the source added.  Sophia also recently hinted that she has moved in with Caitlyn. Sophia took to Instagram to share a photo from her bedroom and eagle eyes fans were convinced that she is staying with Caitlyn. “Home Sweet Home Happy Joyful Peaceful” she captioned the picture along with several hearts emojis. Due to the cushioned headboard behind her many fans thought the place looked familiar. Soon, fans realized that Cait herself has put photos in the past which she has taken from her Malibu house with apparently the same headboard.

13977,"Teresa Giudice isn’t looking to have another day in court. Following fan speculation that the Real Housewives of New Jersey star, 45, was planning to split from husband Joe Giudice after she posted an Instagram photo with a divorce attorney, Teresa clarified that she was simply at dinner with a friend.  As previously reported, Teresa posted a photo to Instagram on Saturday, January 6, posing with New Jersey attorney Loren La Forge-Kyriakoulis. The reality star originally captioned the photo, “Dinner with a great friend getting great advice” before quickly changing it to “Dinner with a great friend lots of laughs” with the hashtag “#webothlovefood.”  During Teresa’s Wednesday, January 10, appearance with sister-in-law Melissa Gorga on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, a fan called in to ask Teresa if the photo indicated she and Joe were on the rocks, which Teresa vehemently denied. “I was helping her. Just in case – If anybody’s getting divorced, she’s a great divorce attorney to call,” she explained. “Get it? I was helping her.”  Gorga, 38, chimed in, “Oh, you’re saying you were publicizing her,” to which Teresa said, “Yes! Capisce? Capisce.”  “What’s the matter with two women sitting together and shooting the breeze,” Teresa continued. “Talking about growing up?”  Gorga, who happened to be at the same restaurant that night, also recalled her initial confusion when she approached the pair at dinner to say hello. “I was like, ‘Who are you?’ and she was like, ‘I’m so and so’ and Teresa’s like, ‘She’s a divorce attorney,’ and I’m like, ‘Huh?’”  During the interview, Teresa also opened up about the months-long period that she didn’t visit her husband, who is currently serving time for conspiracy and bankruptcy fraud. “My mom got sick, so I didn’t see him the whole time my mom was sick, those three months,” she said. “I remember the one day I was going to see him, that’s when my dad got sick, and then I had to turn around and go back.”  “Then there was a chicken pox breakout there, in the prison, so we weren’t allowed to go see him,” she continued. “Oh, and then they found contraband from other inmates!”  However, Teresa, who also served 11 months in prison in 2015 for fraud, isn’t exactly eager to return to jail – even to visit Joe. “You know, I don’t really enjoy going there,” she said. “Even when I was [in prison], I was like, ‘Don’t come!'”  The couple has been plagued by divorce rumors in recent months, however two after before Teresa posted the photo with Forge-Kyriakoulis, the television personality’s attorney James Leonard Jr. shut down the speculation. “I don’t know how to say it any louder or plainer, but it ain’t happening.

In 2014, Justin was spied getting cozy with his backup singer Zenya Ashford at a nightclub in Paris. “Jessica worries when Justin travels for work,” says the insider. “What wife in her position wouldn’t? She is constantly in fear that other women are throwing themselves at him.”  Friends of the couple are praying the duo can overcome their issues. “Jessica and Justin could use time alone to rekindle their love. They could use a vacation,” says the insider. “They’re both loved by those who know them, and everyone is rooting for their marriage to work.

12225,"In the end, a piece of dental floss saved the day.  Rachel Brosnahan’s otherwise perfect night at the Emmy Awards — which included not only a trophy for best actress in a comedy for Amazon’s “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” but also a win for comedy series, among others — had one tiny flaw. There was the little matter of the diamond ring she couldn’t get off her hand.  Hours earlier, in her rush to get dressed, she tried on the “beautiful, beautiful” ring. But then she wanted to switch it to another finger — and it wouldn’t budge. “And then you know when you start pulling on something, it just gets swollen,” she recounts the next morning over a late breakfast in her hotel room in West Hollywood. “So I was on the red carpet minorly panicking about this ring that was very stuck on my finger.”  It wasn’t until she got home in the wee hours that she was able to do a bit of research on YouTube, and learned about the dental floss and olive oil trick. “It’s all the rage,” she says, joking. After a little threading and a lot of slathering, the offending bauble finally slid off her finger. “So much for a perfect night,” she adds with a laugh.  The awards show had barely begun when it was clear the momentum was all in “Maisel’s” favor. First, Alex Borstein (who plays comedy club manager Susie Myerson) won for best supporting actress; then the show’s creator and executive producer, Amy Sherman-Palladino, made history as the first woman to win for both writing and directing in the same year. The next thing Brosnahan knew, Angela Bassett was announcing her name (if butchering it a bit). “I was completely overwhelmed,” says Brosnahan.  She didn’t prepare a speech, she says, but after what she laughingly recalls as the “Oprah debacle” at the Golden Globes — she’d interrupted herself mid-acceptance with a shout-out to Oprah Winfrey — she cobbled together in her head a list of people to thank. But what she really wanted to do was speak to the moment.  “One of the things I love the most about this show … [is] it’s about a woman who is finding her voice anew,” she said from the stage. “It’s something that’s happening all over the country right now. One of the most important ways that we can find and use our voices is to vote. So if you haven’t already registered, do it on your cell phone right now. Vote, show up and bring a friend to the polls.”  Reflecting on the call to action the next morning, she dismisses any suggestion that it was politically motivated. “It didn’t feel political to me,” she says. “It’s our duty as citizens to have a say.”  And while she recognizes that strident speeches from celebrities at awards shows can feel “self-indulgent and vain,” she wasn’t going to miss the opportunity to take advantage of the spotlight to make a point. “We have a huge election coming up, and it’s more important than ever that we exercise our right to vote,” she says. “It’s hard, hard won.”  Brosnahan says she hasn’t decided where she’ll keep her trophy. “The Golden Globe is on the toilet, but the shelf is not big enough for them both.”  Eric Jamison/Invision/AP/REX/Shu  “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” proved marvelous indeed — the comedy, which will debut its second season later this year, would go on to nearly dominate the half-hour categories — winning five prizes that night and eight trophies overall out of 14 nominations. The Academy clearly fell in love with the tale of Midge Maisel, a 1950s New York City housewife whose fairy-tale life gets upended when her husband walks out, leading her to discover a talent for stand-up comedy.  The morning after the Emmy sweep, bleary-eyed after a late-night run to In-N-Out Burger after hitting the party circuit, Brosnahan is slightly dazed. (“I’m bad at parties,” she says apologetically. “Too much mingling and small talk, which has never been my strong suit.”) Despite the trophy sitting nearby on the bed, the win hasn’t quite sunk in.  “I’ll never recover from having my name spoken in the same sentence as the other legendary actresses in this categories who I’ve admired,” she says of her fellow nominees, including Pamela Adlon, Allison Janney, Issa Rae, Tracee Ellis Ross and Lily Tomlin. “It’s just been wild and crazy and incomprehensible. It’s a dream I didn’t know I had.”  The show is something of an acting Olympics — not only must she master that rat-a-tat Sherman-Palladino dialogue, but she also has to deliver it from the stages of comedy clubs as Midge makes the rounds honing her routine.  In person, the 27-year-old actress is nothing like the bold, outspoken Midge — her quiet demeanor is punctuated by soft, self-conscious giggles. “I think we are both ambitious — we’re both resilient, and I think we both see the glass half full,” she says. “But I’m not as confident as Midge, particularly when it comes to work. Midge enters into this whole new field that she has no experience in at all, and genuinely believes in her heart of hearts that she can take it by storm. She never doubts it for a single second. That’s not me.”  Summoning up that bravado is somewhat of a leap for her, she readily acknowledges. It starts with “power posing” in her mirror — and then segues to what she says the show’s first assistant director calls “siren songs.” “I don’t know how you’d ever print this,” she says, letting out an over-the-top “Ahhhhh!”  That, along with copious amounts of caffeine, is what she credits with enabling her to summon the moxie. “Midge has a lot of energy,” she says. “A lot more than we usually have at four in the morning on a Monday.”  Two seasons in (with a third already ordered), Brosnahan admits she’s still intimidated.  “I knew that Midge would become a successful stand-up, but I didn’t really think about what that would look like in practice,” she says. “The audiences are growing now, which means that they’re growing for Midge, but they’re also growing for me. I’m performing in front of more and more people every time I get up onstage, and it’s horrifying. It never gets less horrifying. Although from some stand-ups I’ve spoken to, it doesn’t seem that out of the ordinary. So I’m in good company with the constant state of petrification.”  And then there’s the matter of living up to the creators’ exacting standards, a point Sherman-Palladino highlighted when receiving the trophy for best writing. She thanked the cast for its endurance and “graciously accept[ing] that sometimes it matters when you drop the ‘the.’”  Brosnahan acknowledges the pressure is intense. “But I appreciate that she knows that her dialogue exactly as written is the best version of it,” she says. Two script supervisors are on hand to make sure nothing goes amiss — one matches the actions, and the other is solely there to monitor the dialogue. “She’s very gentle and so lovely and patient,” Brosnahan says, “but she will often come in with a contraction note: ‘It’s “it’s,” and you’re saying “It is.”’ But she’s always right. It’s those tiny, tiny little shifts that make the thing sing.”  The secret of Rachel’s success is good old-fashioned talent and extreme hard work. no one works harder on her craft. she’s a total and utter perfectionist, but in the nicest possible way.  amy sherman-palladino  Sherman-Palladino has created some of TV’s most indelible female characters, working with actresses like Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel and Sutton Foster. (“I need those fast-talking broads!” she quips.) And this partnership, too, has delivered creatively for both.  “The secret of Rachel’s success is good old-fashioned talent and extreme hard work. No one works harder on her craft, on her character,” says Sherman-Palladino. “She’s a total and utter perfectionist, but in the nicest possible way. It’s that fearlessness, that confidence, that strength, that ability to commit everything to a scene, that brings Midge alive. Plus, no one can take off some gloves, a coat and a purse faster or with more precision. That may not sound like much, but in our show — it’s a lifesaver.”  Brosnahan says she’s “completely in awe” of her boss’ talent. “She knows exactly what she wants all the time, not unlike Midge,” she says. “She tackles this enormous show and all of the stuff that comes with it with a real sense of joy.” And she admits she’s desperately striving to keep up with Sherman-Palladino’s famously encyclopedic knowledge of pop culture, whether from today or the 1950s. “She was very dismayed that I didn’t know who the Dionne quintuplets were!” she says.  The costumes also help her get into character — they’re all tailor-made and custom-designed by Donna Zakowska. “I don’t feel complete until I have a wig on, my hair did, lipstick and the corset,” says Brosnahan. It’s not about making her thinner — her petite frame is apparent, even clad in a heavy hotel robe — but about giving her body the right shape for the period. “Midge is very fashion-conscious, and the shape of 1950s fashion was with a long torso and lower waist,” she says, explaining that her waist falls naturally higher. “This way the costumes really do look like they came out of a fashion magazine because that would have been important to Midge.”  She hasn’t quite stolen anything from Midge’s ample closet yet, though she has her eye on a gray knee-length cashmere coat. “It’s so luxurious and heavy and warm, it’s just like wearing a blanket,” she sighs.  Although Brosnahan was shy as a kid growing up in suburban Illinois, she says she always wanted to be an actress.  “Mostly I just had a love for storytelling, from a very young age,” she says. “I loved to read. I was an incessant reader — anything and everything.” Fantasy novels were a favorite — from Roald Dahl to the Harry Potter books — for the way they transported her to faraway, different worlds. “That translated very directly into a love for this kind of storytelling and a love for period pieces.” Bit parts in the third-grade play, “where you pulled your part out of a hat and played Troll No. 2,” translated into more formidable roles in high school and college.  But acting felt like a hobby, she says. “I guess I just didn’t know for a long time that it could be a career. I always felt like maybe I would have to choose something else.” She even considered a career in psychology, which she minored in in college.  We Are The Rhoads for Variety  And then she landed the part of the enigmatic Rachel Posner in Netflix’s “House of Cards,” and turned what was planned to be a five-line role into a recurring character (and snagged an Emmy nom for guest actress).  The series’ then-showrunner Beau Willimon says Brosnahan’s performance “leapt off the screen” so much that they wrote large parts of the season to expand her story. “The more we worked with Rachel, the more obvious it became that she had a long and successful career ahead of her,” he says. “I can’t say we predicted she’d win an Emmy, but with an extraordinary gift like hers, I’m not at all surprised.”  Brosnahan remains grateful for the opportunity the show provided. “I look often at ‘House of Cards,’ which at the time felt like absolutely the hardest, most excruciating and also fulfilling — by the same token — thing I’d ever done up until this point, and they’re just so different. That was challenging because it required digging into emotional depths that I’d never traveled to before and trying to hold my own with such powerhouses around me,” she says. “I’ve been so lucky to be able to say that I had more than one experience that’s as fulfilling as the current one.”  After Brosnahan starred in the WGN America drama series “Manhattan” and took on a few stage roles, the script for “Maisel” landed in her lap. “I fell in love with it from the first page,” she says. “Midge reminded me of so many women that I know and love in my own life that I don’t see on-screen enough — unapologetically confident, ambitious women who approach the world with a sense of insatiable curiosity and joy. She’s complicated too. She’s privileged and selfish and has a hard time seeing outside her previously very narrow worldview. But she’s interested in growing and evolving. And that’s exciting to me as well.”  The Palladinos were cycling through a stream of auditions when Brosnahan walked in.  “There’s a fearlessness to Rachel,” says Sherman-Palladino. “She was not afraid to lean into the anger that Midge was feeling when she took that stage.”  Brosnahan says she recognizes the rage that fuels Midge’s mission. “Women are angry sometimes. Men are angry. Everybody’s angry,” she says. “And wouldn’t you be angry if your husband walked out on you, after all of your goals have been accomplished and dreams have come true? You have a perfect life, and everything comes shattering down. I’m glad it came through, and they bought it.”  Jennifer Salke, head of Amazon Studios, says of Brosnahan’s portrayal: “Rachel brings a rawness and relentless authenticity to Midge that comes from a deeply committed place. The audience has to believe that Midge is on this journey that she never intended would be her path in life. There is never a moment where the performance doesn’t ring true, and that is an unbelievable feat in bringing a character to life.”  The Palladinos had been developing the series for years, but its debut last November couldn’t have been timed more perfectly: The show about a woman finding her voice hit as the national conversation turned to precisely that subject.  “I have no desire to stop playing her anytime soon,” says Brosnahan of Midge Maisel. “I’m into playing her as long as Amy wants to keep writing her and directing her.”  Courtesy of Amazon Studios  “I think it was a fortunate coincidence,” says Brosnahan. “But it’s been really encouraging talking to young women who feel inspired by the show and inspired by Midge in her journey and her innate sense of self-empowerment.”  Brosnahan promises there’s more to come in Season 2 as Midge explores her voice onstage. “I love how she’s asking questions about motherhood and womanhood and the double standards between women and men and some of the hypocrisy that she’s noticing now that she’s got her eyes wide open,” she says. There’s a moment in the second season when she dares to say the word “pregnant” onstage — it was a taboo for comics back then — “and it’s not well received,” she says. “In the 1950s that isn’t something you can talk about. It’s considered crude and rude and private and inappropriate to be discussing in public, and I think that just fuels her fire.”  Though she now has both a Golden Globe and an Emmy to her name, Brosnahan says she doesn’t feel like she’s quite arrived. “I’m not sure you ever have that moment,” she says.  “I think it always feels like the other shoe could drop, and that’s motivating in its own way. It feels kind of important to never feel like ‘I’ve got this.’ It feels like the minute I reach that point, I’ll stop taking risks, and I don’t want to do that.”  While she’s in “Maisel” for the “long haul” (“I have no desire to stop playing her anytime soon”), she’s got her eye out for other projects with female creators.  “I’m dying to work with more women in all different facets of the industry,” she says. “I hope that there’ll be more opportunities to work with more women as we continue the conversation about the need for more women to be represented in different parts of this industry, whether in front of or behind the camera.”  And maybe one day she’ll join their ranks as a producer or director. “I’d like to do it all — if they’ll let me,” she says.",real

And Mom star Anna Faris says she’s found that tribe in fellow mamas Kristen Bell and Reese Witherspoon.  More: Kristen Bell Gets Why Chris Pratt & Anna Faris Split  “I like how they combine humor with raising kids, but also how they tackle motherhood and work without being pretentious,” Faris told Us Weekly. “The first few years, I was like, ‘Oh, my God. Everyone else seems to know exactly what to do and I don’t.’”  Faris said she’s grateful for Witherspoon and Bell’s keep-it-real parenting style and their willingness to be candid about their mistakes. Faris admits she’s still figuring things out. “I question every single thing, like, ‘Oh, I shouldn’t have changed lanes,’ or ‘Why don’t I have hand sanitizer?’ and ‘I should have applied more sunblock,’” she told the magazine. “There’s just so much pressure for parents and it’s tough to let yourself off the hook and be like, ‘You know what? He’s happy. It’s OK.”  Faris and ex-husband (*sob*) Chris Pratt share son Jack, who’s now 5. Fans were devastated by news of the divorce, but by all accounts, Faris and Pratt remain friends and are committed to co-parenting their son in peace. Faris told Extra recently that she and Pratt believe co-parenting is “hugely important.”  “We are great and there’s so much friendship and love, and we surround Jack with love, and funny, kind, happy people, and as a result, he is really happy,” she said. Sounds like Faris — who’s recently thrown herself into her podcast, Unqualified — is doing great and doesn’t need all that help from Bell and Witherspoon at all.

3010,"Jim Carrey has responded to a new report that says he and the late Robin Williams were engaged in a ""bitter feud."" The original report seems to stem from a new biography about Williams that was written by New York Times journalist Dave Itzkoff. In Itzkoff's book, it's touched on that the late comedian felt threatened by Carrey's success in the 1990s. To make matters worse, Robin Williams was reportedly upset that Jim Carrey took over on the role of the Riddler in 1995's Batman Forever after he turned the role down.  The report in question comes from Radar Online, which isn't always 100 percent accurate in all of its reporting. Jim Carrey has made a statement calling the entire report fabricated and made up after a tiny blurb was mentioned in Dave Itzkoff's biography. Carrey acknowledges that there might have been some insecurity on the part of Williams, but there was absolutely no feud. Carrey explains.  ""RadarOnline is completely off base and creating a feud that didn't exist. Robin may have expressed insecurity about me and my rise to success but I have never had anything but the greatest respect for him and his genius. He was also always respectful to me in person. He called me Maestro and I called him Billy the Kid. Let's get it straight. There's no feud if one side isn't aware of it.""  In addition to his statement on the so-called feud with Robin Williams, Jim Carrey took a break from painting the Trump administration and shared a new painting that he did of the late comedian on social media. The painting is done in Carrey's unique style and features Robin Williams with a radiating golden glow around him. Carrey continued to heap praise on Williams in the caption of the photo. He says.  ""Robin Williams' mind was a quantum computer. He was the fastest gun in the West. I loved, respected and admired his brilliance - always.""  This August will be the fourth anniversary of Robin Williams' death. Williams committed suicide on August 14th. The comedian was diagnosed with diffuse Lewy body dementia, which reportedly caused him to lose some of the energy that he was best known for. Williams was misdiagnosed with Parkinson's disease, suffered paranoia, hallucinations, and blank moments at the end of his life. In addition, he didn't feel like he could be funny anymore, according to Itzkoff's biography.  As for Jim Carrey, he's mostly been focusing on painting as a way of social protest after being cleared in the death of his girlfriend. Carrey is a harsh critic of President Trump and creates very unflattering pieces of artwork that portray the president and his administration. While it could be said that he may be in a feud with Trump, he was never in a ""bitter feud"" with the late great Robin Williams.

According to a new report, after the sisters bared their bodies in various nearly nude and bikini photos on Instagram, Jenner believes the twosome are “setting a poor example for their young children.”  At least that’s according to Hollywood Life, as the outlet alleged this week that an insider recently revealed that Caitlyn thinks the twosome’s photos are “in poor taste” and are “poorly timed” amid the important message being spread by the #MeToo movement right now.  A source alleged to the site that “Caitlyn feels Kim and Kourtney are sending the wrong message to their millions of followers” with their skin-baring pictures, as she’s supposedly been trying for years to get the twosome to cover up a little more while she was married to former wife Kris Jenner before their divorce in 2015.  “Caitlyn worries that the sisters’ inappropriate posts are setting a poor example for their young children,” said the source of the star, who reports are claiming could potentially join the cast of Dancing with the Stars Season 26 later this year.  it’s the simple things A post shared by Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) on Jan 23, 2018 at 10:56am PST  Notably, both stars are moms to three young children.

Jenner hasn’t yet confirmed the claims made by the outlet this week and hasn’t spoken publicly regarding her former stepdaughter’s risque snaps, though the site’s insider then added that Caitlyn allegedly “wishes both Kim and Kourtney would behave with more style and grace” after posting the provocative photos to their Instagram accounts, which have racked up millions of likes.  “They are mothers and Caitlyn feels they should behave more responsibly and conservatively,” added Hollywood Life’s insider.  The report comes after both Kim and Kourtney hit the headlines for showing off a whole lot of skin on their respective Instagram pages over the past few weeks.  Featured image credit: Jamie McCarthy Getty Images  Kim’s been posting a number of risqué snaps both before and after the birth of her third child, daughter Chicago, who she and Kanye welcomed via a surrogate on January 15.  Most recently, Kardashian posted a bathroom mirror selfie to the social media site which showed her topless and wearing only sparkly underwear.

They named their daughter Suri, which Tom believed meant ""red rose"" in Persian and ""princess"" in Hebrew, but some linguists say it actually means ""from Syria"" in Hebrew.  The press had been aware of Suri's upcoming arrival for months with headlines about Katie's pregnancy and relationship with Tom on the covers of many gossip magazines. Among the stories was that Tom allegedly bought an expensive sonogram machine so he and Holmes could track Suri's development.  Once Suri was born, the paparazzi struggled to get a shot of the baby, but it was Vanity Fair that scored the first official photo of Suri, selling 70,000 copies of the issue that had the pic on its cover.",fake

8231,"Advertisement  After teasing behind-the-scenes images from the London photoshoot this July, the 2018 Pirelli Calendar has made its debut — and it's just getting curiouser and curiouser.  This year, the hotly-anticipated calendar by the Pirelli company, which has been published annually since 1963, features a whimsical Alice in Wonderland theme — and, for the first time ever, and all-black cast of subjects.  Photographed by Tim Walker and styled by new British Vogue editor Edward Enninful, each page depicts another fantastical scene from the beloved Lewis Carroll book, with actors, models, rappers, and even activists stepping into the fictional roles.  Scroll down for video  Fish-eye effect: Diddy and Naomi Campbell play the two Royal Beheaders in the Alice-In-Wonderland-themed 2018 Pirelli calendar, but look much more like they are starring in a '90s hip-hop video  Down the rabbit hole: The calendar has an all-black cast, with model Duckie Thot taking on a starring role as Alice  The royals: RuPaul plays the Queen of Hearts and Blood Diamond star Djimon Hounsou plays the King of Hearts  More royals: Whoopi Goldberg and albino model-lawyer Thando Hopa stand in as the Royal Duchess and Princess of Hearts  Taking her role seriously: Campbell looked glamorously threatening as she posed as one of the Royal Beheaders  Duo: Diddy and the supermodel looked positively regal during their joint photo shoot as the Royal Beheaders  Having a disagreement? Campbell at one point curled her left hand into a fist, suggesting the Royal Beheaders might not see eye to eye on everything  Milestone: The model and Diddy are part of the first all-black cast to have starred in a Pirelli calendar since 1987  Model Duckie Thot plays Alice herself, posing upside-down with her feet on the ceiling in a too-small house after downing the magical Eat Me cookie.  RuPaul is the Queen of Hearts. looking fabulous and menacing in a red dress while the King of Hearts (played by Blood Diamond star Djimon Hounsou) stands nearby. In another shot, RuPaul presides over a royal court, clearly not one to be messed with.  Naomi Campbell and Sean 'Diddy' Combs take on the roles of the Royal Beheaders, looking nearly indistinguishable from a pair of stars in a late-90s rap video save for the axes in their hands.  'That bold statement by Pirelli, I think, really goes against any ignorance,' Diddy said. 'People of color all over the world need to know that they're kings and queens, and I think that story of Alice in Wonderland puts that in that proper perspective.'  And Whoopi Goldberg and albino model-lawyer Thando Hopa stand in as the Royal Duchess and Princess of Hearts, respectively.  'When you think of the Pirelli calendar, I'm not the face that comes up,' Whoopi said. 'I know that. But girls, little girls like me wait to see someone who looks like me in a calendar. So, ta-dah!'  Rounding out the cast are model Slick Woods as the Mad Hatter, Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o as the Dormouse, American Honey actress Sasha Lane as the Mad March Hare, stylist Zoe Bedeaux as the Caterpillar, women's right activist Jaha Dukurehas the Wonderland Princess, model Adut Akech as the Quene of diamonds, rapper Lil Yachty as the Queen's Guard, and model and activist Adwoa Aboah as Tweedledee.  Models Alpha Dia, King Owusu, and Wilson Oryema each play both gardeners and playing cards, while King also plays Tweedledum.  Star-studded: Behind-the-scenes photos were first unveiled this summer  King of Hearts: They gave a peak at the whimsical set and costumes  Something different: New British Vogue editor Edward Enninful styled the shoot, which features an all-black cast  Queen of Hearts: Reality TV star and drag queen RuPaul looks breathtaking as the fearsome red queen  The Mad Hatter: Taking on one of the best-known roles of the story is American model Slick Woods  Owning it: RuPaul (pictured center as the Queen Of Hearts) admitted it took a lot of 'moxie' to pull off his costume  Representation: 'When you think of the Pirelli calendar, I'm not the face that comes up,' Whoopi (pictured with Hopa) said. 'I know that. But girls, little girls like me wait to see someone who looks like me in a calendar. So, ta-dah!'  Three-dimensional: Nyong'o was glad to be working with Walker, whose cinematic approach to photography agreed with her actor's mind. 'It's really cool to be in a moment where it's not just about the sexuality of my body,' she said  Enninful got involved after Walker reached out to him to pitch the concept, at which point Enninful said taking part in the project was a 'no-brainer'.  'It seemed like such a simple idea, the retelling of Alice in Wonderland with an all-black cast,' the Vogue editor added, looking back on the genesis of the calendar.  Walker realized that the story of Alice In Wonderland had been told many times in the past, and this wanted to go back to the 'genesis' of the story told by Lewis Carroll in 1865.  The calendar is Campbell's fourth, and she noted that she did one in her teens, one in her twenties, another in her thirties, and the present one in her forties.  'I'm just really happy as I'm someone that fights every day for balance and diversity in the modeling world. So to see this happen is absolutely beyond my wildest dreams,' the supermodel said.  Diddy revealed he's had Alice In Wonderland quotes tattooed on his arms for five years, including a bit of dialogue that enabled him to put his 'own take' on the narrative. On his bicep, a conversation between Alice and Sean can be read, with Alice saying 'This is impossible' and Diddy responding: 'Nothing is impossible.'  The calendar also marks the first time worked with Walker, whose work she has always admired. She became so excited when he walked her through his concept she felt like she was having a 'mini heart attack'.  RuPaul was equally enthusiastic about stepping into the Queen Of Hearts' shoes.  'I'm so excited about my gorgeous costume that Edward has created for me,' he said. 'It's a lot of costume, and it takes a lot of moxie to pull it off. I think I can handle it though.'  The Drag Race host deemed being asked to be part of this year's calendar 'quite an honor', especially given the 'iconic' people he got to work with. 'But also just the story of Alice straddling two worlds and coming to terms with these two worlds and learning to navigate... I think it's very telling for anybody who's alive today,' he added.  Nyong'o was glad to be working with Walker, whose cinematic approach to photography agreed with her actor's mind.  'It's really cool to be in a moment where it's not just about the sexuality of my body but it's about the intelligence, the sensuality, sometimes the innocence, the complication of my experiences as a human being,' she said.  Dukureh, who is better known for her work as an activist who raises awareness about female genital mutilation, child marriage, and violence against women, didn't expect to be asked to take part in the glamorous project.  'Being here represents the untold stories of millions of girls who would never get an opportunity to do something like this,' she said.

33,"    1 / 7 Chevron Chevron Photo: Everett Collection Zombieland (2009) ZOMBIELAND, Emma Stone, 2009, Ph: Glen Wilson/© Columbia/courtesy Everett Collection  It was confirmed today that Emma Stone will take to the screen as Cruella de Vil, the puppy-hunting fashion villain from 101 Dalmatians, in the upcoming live-action film Cruella. While we don’t see Stone herself as the anti-puppy type, her casting comes as no surprise—not only because the actress has spent the better part of her career proving she can drive almost any film in a starring role, but also because we can already imagine her in that signature color-blocked bob.  Stone has never shied away from a scene-stealing dye job. Take 2009’s Zombieland, for which she dipped her natural blonde locks a dark chocolate. While she’s often thought of as a redhead, she’s actually only donned the fiery color for fun and film, trying everything from the warm cinnamon of Irrational Man to the auburn waves in Gangster Squad. Even as a blonde she’s left no shade unturned: The Help may be significant for those wild curls, but we’ll remember it for her pitch-perfect strawberry hue. Spiderman 2 saw her go paler still, but her part in Birdman took the peroxide even further with a shock of near-white layers. Now, as Cruella, she’ll wear both the visual equivalent of the absence of color and every single color at once.

4069,"LOS ANGELES—(Spoiler alert: This column has spoilers about the movie, “Interstellar.”) Why was Matt Damon’s casting in “Interstellar” kept under wraps until recently? This question and more were answered by spouses Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas, director and producer, respectively, of the sci-fi/adventure/drama.  “Interstellar,” written by Chris and his brother Jonah, follows a team of explorers as they travel beyond the galaxy to find another home for humankind since Earth is nearing its end.  ADVERTISEMENT  While “Interstellar” features some stunning visual images of the voyage, the film succeeds more when it delves into relationships through a family, that of Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), an experienced pilot, and his two children, Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and Tom (Timothee Chalamet).  Jessica Chastain and Ellen Burstyn portray Murph at various ages while Casey Affleck plays the older Tom. Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, John Lithgow and Topher Grace round out the cast.  Excerpts from our interview:  Why did you keep Matt Damon’s casting a secret?  Chris Nolan (C): I imagined Doctor Mann a bit like from Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness.” You have Kurtz, this character that you hear about. Everybody says, “Oh, he’s great. Maybe you’ll get to meet him.” I really love the idea for an audience to go, when they see him, “Oh, it’s Matt Damon. It’s going to be okay.”  Matt very graciously agreed to do it. He didn’t have to shoot for long. So we didn’t want to market the film using him because he’s not in it very much. We didn’t want to mislead people. But Matt is a very important part of the movie. It’s fun to watch with an audience who doesn’t know because they haven’t heard about it.  Matt has the most amazing ability to project integrity and warmth. So he turns up in the film and he’s got a plan and it’s all going to be okay. For me, to realize that he’s a frail human being and subject to cowardice and all the terrible weaknesses that we all have… he loved that challenge. I loved what he did with it.  Emma Thomas (E): If people get to watch the film twice, it’s so great watching Matt when you know what’s really going on.  C: When people see Matt’s face, they are like, oh, okay. It’s the lift that the movie needs at that point. Structurally, you have a lot of talk in the 20 minutes before. There’s a lot of negativity, a lot bad things happening. The film is very much going to a dark place at that point. So getting that lift in that way with a great actor and movie star coming on screen, is a good thing.  ADVERTISEMENT  How has the dynamics between the two of you evolved over the years?  E: (Laughs.) We love working together— obviously, with Jonah as well—in a large part because, when you are working with somebody whom you are tied to beyond by blood or marriage, there’s a lack of agenda. Or as Chris once said, I (Emma) have an agenda. He knows what it is. (Laughs.)  But there’s a level of trust that is fantastic, particularly when you are making a big movie like this one. I am often asked as a producer and when Chris is the director, “When do you tell Chris, no, he can’t have that?” The truth is, I am very lucky because Chris is also a producer. He takes every aspect of the filmmaking process very seriously.  He is very helpful in terms of trying to figure out how we make the film for the correct budget, and so on. To me, it’s never absolutely saying no. I tell Chris [how I feel about] certain things. We have discussions. But ultimately, it’s Chris’ vision. He always has a very strong idea of what a film is going to be. He’s the director and it’s very much his film.  I see my job as being very much a facilitator for that, filtering out the things that he doesn’t have to worry about so he can concentrate on getting the film made.  C: It’s fantastic working with people you have worked with a long time and have a high degree of trust in. Emma is always very objective, which is great… I consider Emma a very good gauge (from a moviegoer perspective) because she’s not particularly interested in science-fiction or science. (Laughs.)  I show her the film and ask, “Are you following the emotional threads?” What’s wonderful about working with someone like Emma is that I get an honest opinion, good or bad, instantly. There are no politics to it.  This film’s working title or code name was “Flora’s Letter,” a cinematic letter to your daughter. How is your relationship with your kids reflected in the story?  C: The relationship between a father and his children was clearly something I related to very strongly in the script. Murph was originally written as a boy in my brother’s draft. I changed the character to a girl—just instinctively. It may well be because Flora, my eldest, is a girl.  You do have different relationships with sons and daughters. It really paid off with Matthew because what he was very determined about was that his character’s love for his children should be equal for both. The character having a girl and a boy took the burden off the idea of favoritism. It’s not that he loves Murph more than he loves Tom. There’s just a different relationship. And Murph is more interested in science and the things that have driven her father’s life.  E: Girls are much more complicated, I feel. And boys are rather…  C: Simple.  E: I wouldn’t say simple.  C: That’s what you were thinking, though.  E: It’s complicated. It’s one of my favorite things about the film. I almost don’t think of it as a big, spectacular space movie. I really love the relationships. They feel very real to me as the mother of a girl and boys.  When I watch Mackenzie’s performance, she feels incredibly real to me. I [see] my own daughter in her. Going back to the code name question, I will just say that we have always had code names for our films—our kids’ names. It was just Flora’s turn (laughs).  What are the kids’ ages?  E: Now that’s a difficult question (laughs). They are 12, 11, 9 and 7. Flora is the oldest.  Emma, you were quoted as saying that Chris could not have done this film 12 years ago when you didn’t have kids. Can you both talk about that?  E: I am not saying that Chris couldn’t have made this film 12 years ago. But there’s such a heart, such a reality to the relationships in the movie. The reason we pick a movie to make—because it’s a long process—is that you have to feel an affinity for the story. You have to want to put that story up on the screen.  The place that Chris and I are in now is very different from where we were 12 years ago. This is a story that we are interested in telling. It’s also a movie that is fun to watch with our kids. We watch different movies now than we did 12 years ago because the kids came along.  C: The simple answer is, I don’t know if I couldn’t [have done this movie 12 years ago], but I wouldn’t have and I didn’t. Becoming a father was a very big change in my life, something that affected my outlook and the kind of stories that I am interested in telling and in ways that I would have never been able to predict and not in simple ways.  We did a press conference yesterday and Matthew was asked about being a father. He said he could have played the part even before he had kids. What I didn’t say to him because I didn’t want to embarrass him—but I am going to embarrass him now—is that I would have found it very difficult to cast someone who wasn’t a father. Matthew was absolutely the right person to play the role. He’s a terrific father.  Why did you choose a Dylan Thomas poem to use in the film?  C: Those lines at the end—“Do not go gentle into that good night… Rage, rage against the dying of the light”—I have [not] heard a better way of expressing the sentiment of death, dying, the end of the world, any of those things. There’s such a raw emotion in those words; they speak to me so strongly. I didn’t want to write my own version of that. Another example, which I didn’t use, would be of TS Elliot saying, “This is the way the world ends/Not with a bang but a whimper.”  (E-mail the columnist at [email protected] Follow him at www.twitter.com/nepalesruben.)

14018,"Georgina Chapman, co-founder of the Marchesa fashion line, saw her label soar to prominence and profits—thanks in some measure to Harvey Weinstein, the rich and powerful movie mogul she married in 2007.  Now that Weinstein has become a pariah, engulfed in allegations of sexual harassment from well over a dozen women including famous actresses like Gwyneth Paltrow, Rose McGowan, and Ashley Judd, it’s widely believed that Chapman’s Marchesa label will suffer a dramatic fall—at least in Hollywood circles.  “No star is ever going to want to wear the brand again,” one publicist told the Hollywood Reporter.  Harvey Weinstein and Georgina Chapman attend a Broadway show in New York in late 2015. Walter McBride—WireImage  That publicist asked to remain anonymous, and indeed, few sources will speak on the record or make any comment at all about Weinstein, Chapman, or Marchesa. It seems that the Weinstein scandal is so toxic that retailers, Hollywood insiders, and pros in the fashion business don’t want to be linked to it in any way.  In statements, Weinstein has said that has “behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain.” He officially resigned from the production firm he co-founded, the Weinstein Company, this week, and is believed to be seeking treatment in Arizona. A Weinstein spokesperson also said that “any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein,” and “there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.”  Here’s what we know about what Weinstein has meant for Chapman and her Marchesa label—and how Chapman’s business interests and net worth could be impacted by the revelations about her husband.  Georgina Chapman’s Net Worth Before Her Split from Harvey Weinstein  Right after the first sexual misconduct allegations surfaced earlier this month, Weinstein said his wife was “100 percent behind me.” But Chapman soon announced she was separating from her husband. “My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions,” Chapman said in a released statement. “I have chosen to leave my husband. Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time.”  Weinstein responded to news of the separation by saying that he supports his wife’s decision. “I am in counseling and perhaps, when I am better, we can rebuild,” he said in a statement. “There has been a lot of pain for my family that I take full responsibility for.”  Chapman, 41, was born in London and attended the Chelsea College of Art and Design, where she met her future business partner, Keren Craig. The two co-founded Marchesa together in 2004, the same year that Chapman started dating Weinstein, 24 years her senior. Chapman has periodically worked as a model and actress. Marchesa launched a bridal line in 2008, roughly six months after Weinstein and Chapman were married.  Georgina Chapman prepares a model before Marchesa Bridal Presentation during New York Fashion Week in April. Slaven Vlasic—Getty Images  Chapman has an estimated net worth of £15 million, or roughly $20 million, compared to $250 million to $300 million for her husband, Harvey Weinstein. The couple sold a home in Connecticut for $1.65 million in early October, and still own two other oceanfront homes in Connecticut, each assessed at over $7 million. The couple hosted a lavish $38,500-per-person Barack Obama fundraiser in 2012 at their compound in the state.  Another home owned by Weinstein and Chapman—a 9,000-square-foot waterfront mansion in the Hamptons—was put on the market in August with an asking price of $12.4 million. The couple’s main home is a townhouse in New York City’s West Village, which they purchased for $15 million in 2007.  How these properties might be divided is a mystery. According to E! News, Chapman and Weinstein signed a prenuptial agreement before getting married in late 2007. The terms of their separation and likely divorce are unknown. “You would anticipate at least the vast majority of the financial side of this to be handled behind closed doors with the business managers,” a family law specialist told E!  It also remains murky how Chapman’s separation from Weinstein might impact her business interests, including Marchesa. Marchesa has not responded to MONEY’s requests for comment.  Actresses Tied to Harvey Weinstein Have Worn Marchesa on the Red Carpet for Years  Renee Zellweger, Jennifer Lopez, Gwyneth Paltrow, Felicity Huffman, Kerry Washington and Jennifer Lawrence all wearing Marchesa. Getty Images (6)  With red carpet season on the horizon, the choice of designers worn by actresses will demonstrate implicitly how Hollywood feels about Marchesa—and, by extension, Chapman and Weinstein.  Ten years ago, the New York Times observed that Marchesa’s designs had enjoyed a “Short Walk to the Red Carpet,” with actresses like Jennifer Lopez and Sienna Miller wearing the previously low-profile label to events like the Golden Globes.  There was an explanation for why Marchesa was suddenly favored by A-listers: The gossip indicated that Weinstein, who was dating Chapman at the time and had provided funding for the brand, was in the habit of strong-arming actresses tied to his productions into wearing Marchesa dresses.  Now, many signs suggest the gossip was true. Felicity Huffman confirmed that Weinstein said he would not put money behind her film, Transamerica, unless she wore Marchesa on the red carpet. Many other actresses involved in Weinstein-backed films, including Renee Zellweger, Mischa Barton, Cate Blanchett, and Sienna Miller, also appear to have been asked to wear Marchesa during awards season.  At Least One Marchesa Partnership Has Folded  On October 5—the same day the New York Times published the first of multiple reports about Weinstein’s alleged sexual misconduct—Helzberg Diamonds announced the launch of a partnership with Marchesa for a line new of diamond engagement rings, priced from $2,499 to $9,499. It was supposed to be called the Marchesa Radiant Star Collection.  Soon, though, around the time that another bombshell story about Weinstein’s alleged harassment was published by the New Yorker, mention of Marchesa disappeared from Helzberg’s website. The Kansas City-based firm, which is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, soon released a short statement, without elaborating, that “the company is not launching the Marchesa brand at this time,” to the Hollywood Reporter.  One wedding stylist told the New York Post that, generally speaking, the brand’s sales are likely to flail in the wake of the Weinstein scandal, and a fashion publicist said that Marchesa employees are trying to find other jobs. An anonymous retailer also told the Post that some stores will probably stop selling Marchesa products.  However, Marchesa dresses and jewelry are still widely available for purchase from major retailers such as Macy’s, Neiman Marcus, and Bergdoff Goodman.  While most retailers have chosen not to comment on Marchesa, Chapman, or Weinstein, at least one upscale seller has voiced support for the brand. “Bergdoff Goodman and Marchesa have been longtime partners — we were the first store to pick up the brand when it launched in 2004. We have been avid supporters of Georgina and Keren’s work ever since and hope to continue supporting the brand in the future,” Linda Fargo, a senior vice president for Bergdoff Goodman said recently, according to Women’s Wear Daily.  More Backlash Against Marchesa and Chapman to Follow?  “We all knew celebrities were asked to wear Marchesa if they were in a Weinstein movie,” the co-owner of a fashion communications company who asked to remain anonymous recently said to the New York Times. “They were supposed to wear it at least once. We all knew that cycle.”  Now, however, with Weinstein powerless and out of the picture, that cycle is broken. It is unclear if Chapman knew about any of the alleged misconduct on the behalf of her husband, but entertainment industry experts say her brand will suffer from guilt by association.  Georgina Chapman (right) and Harvey Weinstein (center) at a 2016 New York Fashion Week event. Theo Wargo—Getty Images for New York Fashio  Weinstein is “very much a figure who has been a bridge between Hollywood and the fashion worlds. So I think it’s going to be hard to disentangle Marchesa from his image,” Booth Moore, the fashion news director for the Hollywood Reporter, who has covered the Weinstein scandal extensively, explained in an interview with NPR. “I think that people really are voting with their dollars or, you know, really are emotional about the way that they spend money nowadays so that this scandal could affect the fortunes of Marchesa.”  Kim Vernon, the president and CEO of the Vernon Co. brand consultancy, told Women’s Wear Daily (WWD) that she “would expect that most of those actresses would distant [sic] themselves from wearing those gowns at their awards and red-carpet events.”  However, Vernon still thinks that Marchesa won’t necessarily be dropped by mainstream retailers, and that the brand could still have a promising future even if its dresses are never again regularly worn by stars: “I think they can have a successful business without Hollywood. They do a real business with the Notte second line and a lot of licensed products.”  Marchesa sales might not be affected much in some stores. One retailer spokesperson, who chose to remain anonymous, told WWD that Marchesa sales have been “really fantastic,” and that “our customer really hasn’t connected the dots that he [Weinstein] and she [Chapman] are married.”",real
14159,"First episode is wonderful, and features Edgar Ramirez as Gianni Versace. You can't take your eyes off this actor. Although all the acting is fine, when ""Versace"" (Ramirez) is on the screen, he's the one you look at. He is, or soon will be, a major star.    Episode 1 shows the magnificent, opulant estate Versace built via what he earned on his journey from poverty to the building of a fashion empire. Located in Florida, it's a rare look into the living style of someone with consummate taste and the money to express it. What a man. What a house.    Unfortunately, the rest of the series (so far, only 6 have aired, out of 9) doesn't live up to the first episode, even though Darren Criss's nuanced performance as Andrew Cunanan, the assassin who shot down Versace, is excellent, as are performances of the other actors, particularly that by Penelope Cruz as Gianni's sister, Donatella. Ricky Martin turns in a good job as Gianni's longtime companion Antonio D'Amico.    Serial killer Cunanan's story is told in flashbacks.    This drama is based on a true story, which makes it all the more interesting, but it's Edgar Ramirez' presence that keeps me coming back, hoping for more.",real

1557,"Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.  Music’s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton — aka the rocker and the country boy — have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait — if that’s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing … they’re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his “Country Music Freaks” trek.      This isn’t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton’s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.  Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:",fake
12465,"Throwback! Before Meghan Markle stole Prince Harry’s heart — and America’s as Rachel Zane on Suits — she was a briefcase model on Deal or No Deal.  Markle’s job as one of the models on stage was to reveal the amount of money in the briefcase after the contestant picked a number. The bride-to-be appeared on the former NBC game show during the 2006-2007 season.  The Suits actress, 36, opened up about her time doing odd jobs during an interview with Esquire before getting her role on the USA hit in 2011.  “I would put that in the category of things I was doing while I was auditioning to try to make ends meet. I went from working in the U.S. Embassy in Argentina to ending up on Deal,” Markle told the publication in 2013. “It’s run the gamut. Definitely working on Deal or No Deal was a learning experience, and it helped me to understand what I would rather be doing.”  Markle also spoke about working as a freelance calligrapher.  “I’ve always had a propensity for getting the cursive down pretty well,” she explained. “What it evolved into was my pseudo-waitressing job when I was auditioning. I didn’t wait tables. I did calligraphy for the invitations, for, like, Robin Thicke and Paula Patton’s wedding.”  Markle met Harry, 33, in July 2016, but the newly engaged pair did not confirm their relationship until that November. Palace officials revealed in a statement on Tuesday, November 28, that Markle and Harry will get married at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle in England in May 2018.  During her first joint interview with Harry on Monday, November 27, Markle revealed she would be retiring from acting.  “I think what’s been so exciting [transitioning] out of my career and into, as you said, the causes I can focus even more energy on, very early out of the gate, [is that you] have a voice that people listen to, a lot of responsibility,” Markle said.  “I see it is a new change, a new chapter,” she continued. “I’ve been working on my show seven years, we were so fortunate to have that longevity, and I feel like I checked that box and am very proud of the work I’ve done there.”",real

8202,"American country music singer and television personality  Blake Tollison Shelton (born June 18, 1976)[1] is an American country music singer and television personality. In 2001, he made his debut with the single ""Austin"". The lead-off single from his self-titled debut album, ""Austin"" spent five weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. The now Platinum-certified debut album also produced two more top 20 entries (""All Over Me"" and ""Ol' Red"").[1]  His second and third albums, 2003's The Dreamer and 2004's Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill, are gold and platinum, respectively.[1] His fourth album, Pure BS (2007), was re-issued in 2008 with a cover of Michael Bublé's pop hit ""Home"" as one of the bonus tracks.[2] His fifth album, Startin' Fires was released in November 2008.[1] It was followed by the extended plays Hillbilly Bone and All About Tonight in 2010, and the albums Red River Blue in 2011,[3] Based on a True Story... in 2013, Bringing Back the Sunshine in 2014, If I'm Honest in 2016, and Texoma Shore in 2017.  As of May 2020 , Shelton has charted 40 singles, including 27 number ones,[4] 17 of which were consecutive. The 11th No. 1 (""Doin' What She Likes"") broke ""the record for the most consecutive No. 1 singles in the Country Airplay chart's 24-year history"".[5] He is an eight-time Grammy Award nominee.[6]  Shelton is also known for his role as a judge on the televised singing competitions Nashville Star, Clash of the Choirs, and as a coach on NBC's The Voice. He has been on The Voice since its inception, and in seven of eighteen seasons (2–4, 7, 11, 13, 18), a member of his team has won.  Early life [ edit ]  Shelton was born in Ada, Oklahoma, to Dorothy, a beauty salon owner, and Richard Shelton, a used car salesman. Shelton began singing at an early age and by the age of 12, he was taught how to play the guitar by his uncle.[7] By age 15, he had written his first song. By age 16, he had received a Denbo Diamond Award in his home state.[1] On November 13, 1990, his older brother Richie Shelton (who was 24) was killed in an automobile accident.[8] After graduating from high school at 17, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a singing career. There he got a job at a music publishing company and, in 1997, he was aided by Bobby Braddock to obtain a production contract with Sony Music.[9]  Music career [ edit ]  2001–2006: Beginnings [ edit ]  Shelton performing at the Crawford County Fair in Meadville, PA, in August 2005  Some years later in Nashville, he signed to Giant Records in 2001. In 2001, he was slated to release a song entitled ""I Wanna Talk About Me"" as a single. However, staff at the label considered the song unsuitable for a lead-off single, and the song was eventually recorded by Toby Keith, whose version was a number 1 single.[10]  Instead, Giant released ""Austin"" as Shelton's debut single. Shortly after that song was released, Giant Records was closed, and Shelton was transferred to parent company Warner Bros. Records. ""Austin"" became Shelton's first number-one hit on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts and spent five weeks at that position. Warner released Shelton's self-titled debut album, which was produced by songwriter Bobby Braddock. It also produced the Top 20 hits ""All Over Me"", which Shelton co-wrote with Earl Thomas Conley and Mike Pyle, and ""Ol' Red"".[1] Although Shelton's rendition of ""Ol' Red"" was not a major radio hit, he considers it his signature song, and it has become popular in concert.[11] The album received a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 1,000,000 copies.[12]  The album received a positive review from Maria Konicki Dinoia of Allmusic, who called ""Austin"" ""tremendously imaginative"" and praised Shelton for including songs written by Braddock and Conley.[13] Country Standard Time was less favorable, with Scott Homewood saying that the ""album just smacks of being assembled with the intent on capturing the burgeoning alternative country market"".[14]  Shelton's second album, The Dreamer, was first released on February 4, 2003, on Warner Bros. Records. Its lead-off single, ""The Baby"", reached No. 1 on the country charts, holding that position for three weeks. Although the second and third singles (""Heavy Liftin'"" and ""Playboys of the Southwestern World"", respectively) only reached No.32 and No. 24, The Dreamer earned gold certification as well. He, along with Andy Griggs and Montgomery Gentry, sang guest vocals on Tracy Byrd's mid-2003 single ""The Truth About Men"". Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill was the title of Shelton's third studio album, released in 2004.[1] Its lead-off single, the Harley Allen co-write ""When Somebody Knows You That Well"", peaked at No.37 on the country charts, while the follow-up ""Some Beach"" became his third No.1 hit, holding that position for four weeks. It was followed by a cover of Conway Twitty's 1988 single ""Goodbye Time"".[15] Both this cover and its followup, ""Nobody but Me"", reached Top Ten for Shelton as well. As with his first album, Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill was certified platinum. Accompanying the album's release was a video collection entitled Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill: A Video Collection.[1]  On December 18, 2005, several of Shelton's songs, including ""Nobody but Me"", appeared on the TV movie The Christmas Blessing, starring Neil Patrick Harris, Rebecca Gayheart, Angus T. Jones, and Rob Lowe. Shelton had a small role at the end of the movie, playing himself at a benefit concert, singing ""Nobody but Me"".  2006–2011: Pure BS and Startin' Fires [ edit ]  Shelton at the 45th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards  Shelton released his fourth studio album, Pure BS, in early 2007.[1] Unlike with his first three albums, which were produced entirely by Bobby Braddock, Shelton worked with Braddock, Brent Rowan, and Paul Worley as producers for this album. Its first two singles—""Don't Make Me"" and ""The More I Drink""—were both Top 20 hits on the country charts, respectively reaching No.12 and No. 19. Also in late 2007, Shelton made appearances on television shows: first as a judge on the talent competition Nashville Star, and later on Clash of the Choirs.  Pure BS was re-released in 2008 with three bonus tracks, including a cover of Michael Bublé's hit single ""Home"". This cover, released in early 2008 as the album's third single, became his fourth No.1 hit in July.[16]  ""Home"" was followed in August 2008 by the single ""She Wouldn't Be Gone"", his 14th chart entry and his fifth No. 1 hit. It was the first time in his career that he had two consecutive number ones. ""She Wouldn't Be Gone"" is the lead-off to Shelton's fifth studio album, Startin' Fires, which has also produced the single ""I'll Just Hold On."" This album also includes ""Bare Skin Rug,"" a duet with Lambert.[17] It was produced by Scott Hendricks, except for one track which was produced by Brent Rowan, and another (""I Don't Care"", which carried over from Pure BS) was produced by Braddock.[18] After ""I'll Just Hold On"" fell off the chart in October 2009, Blake Shelton released a duet with Trace Adkins titled ""Hillbilly Bone"". It was the lead single on Shelton's EP, Hillbilly Bone, released on March 2, 2010, through Reprise Records Nashville. After ""Hillbilly Bone"" reached No. 1 in February, came the August release of ""All About Tonight"", the lead-off single to his EP of the same name. In September, he released the second single from All About Tonight, ""Who Are You When I'm Not Looking"", his 18th single release. He released his first greatest hits album, Loaded: The Best of Blake Shelton in November 2010.  Shelton was invited to join the Grand Ole Opry during the September 28, 2010, ""Country Comes Home"" concert celebrating reopening of the Grand Ole Opry House after the Cumberland River flooded the Opry House in May 2010.

The song received 138,000 downloads in its first week and was certified gold in its seventh week, setting a record for the fastest gold certification by a male country singer.[22] On June 13, 2011, in its tenth chart week, ""Honey Bee"" went to No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart, becoming his ninth No. 1 and his fastest-climbing. The album was expected to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with around 110,000 copies sold.[23] ""God Gave Me You"", a cover of a Dave Barnes song, was the album's second single; it also reached No. 1. ""Drink on It"", the fifth song on the album, hit No. 1 in April 2012, giving him his 11th No. 1 song. On April 30, 2012, Blake performed ""Over"" on the Semi-finals of the second season of The Voice. ""Over"" became Shelton's seventh consecutive No. 1. and his 12th No. 1 hit to date.

His debut single ""Austin"", off his 2001 Platinum-selling self-titled album, tied the record set by Billy Ray Cyrus in 1992, staying atop the country charts for five weeks, and setting the mark for an artist's debut single in the Broadcast Data Systems era.[80][81] The success of ""Austin"" also led Shelton to claim the No. 1 position on both Billboard's Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart and Top Country Singles Sales chart, making him the first debut male country artist to own the top spot on both charts simultaneously.[82] Later, in 2010, Shelton's first single, ""Honey Bee"", from his sixth studio album Red River Blue, set a new record for the most first-week downloads by a male country singer.[83] As a result of the downloads, the song debuted at number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart dated for the week ending April 23, 2011. This entry made Shelton the highest-debuting male country artist on the Hot 100 since Garth Brooks (recording as Chris Gaines) debuted at number five in September 1999.[84] As a result of the song's massive commercial success, Shelton also claimed the record for the fastest rising single ever to sell over 500,000 digital copies by a male country soloist.[85] In 2013, Shelton's eighth album, Based on a True Story..., spawned the hit ""Doin' What She Likes"", which broke the record previously set by Brad Paisley in 2009 for the most consecutive No. 1 singles in the Country Airplay chart's 24-year history, since it was first tracked by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems in January 1990.[86] In 2016, ""Came Here to Forget"", the lead-off single from Shelton's tenth studio album If I'm Honest, extended this streak into a record-breaking 17 consecutive number-one singles, leading him to surpass Earl Thomas Conley's record of 16 consecutive number-one singles.[87] As of 2017 , Shelton remains one of only five country artists to have achieved No. 1 status on the Billboard Artist 100 chart, having charted all 156 weeks the chart has existed.[88] The CMA Awards also recognizes Shelton, in addition to George Strait and Vince Gill, as the record holders for the most Male Vocalist of the Year wins, as all three have each garnered five victories. On January 18, 2017, Shelton made People's Choice Awards history by becoming the first country artist to ever win the all-genre category of Favorite Album over competitors Beyoncé, Drake, Rihanna and Ariana Grande.[67] During the ceremony, Shelton also took home the trophy for Favorite Male Country Artist, marking his second consecutive win in the category. On November 6, 2017, Shelton made Country Aircheck history when he became the first artist in the history of the chart to chart six songs simultaneously, from his eleventh studio album Texoma Shore.[89][90]  On November 14, 2017, Shelton made People Magazine history by becoming the first country artist ever to grace the magazine's Sexiest Man Alive cover issue, and is only the second musician, apart from fellow The Voice coach Adam Levine, to receive the coveted honor.[91][92] In 2016, Billboard released their list of ""Greatest of All Time Country Artists"" and recognized Shelton on the chart, ranking him at No. 50.[93] Shelton also charted on Billboard's list of ""Greatest of All Time Country Albums"" and ""Greatest of All Time Country Songs"" with Based on a True Story... taking the position of No. 51 on the chart and ""God Gave Me You"" ranking at No. 80 on the chart, respectively.[94][95]  In 2019, Billboard released their list of decade-end ""Top Country Albums"" and recognized Shelton on the chart, ranking him at No. 14 for Based on a True Story..., No. 24 for Reloaded: 20 #1 Hits, No. 49 for If I'm Honest, and No. 50 for Red River Blue.[96] Shelton also charted on Billboard's decade-end list of ""Top Country Songs"" with ""God Gave Me You"" ranking at No. 19 on the chart, ""Honey Bee"" ranking at No. 23, and ""God's Country"" taking the position of No. 26 on the chart.[97] Shelton also charted on Billboard's decade-end list of ""Top Billboard 200 Albums"" with Based on a True Story... ranking at No. 51.[98] Shelton ended 2019 on the Hot Country Songs chart with 52 entries, the most of any country artist this decade.[99]  Personal life [ edit ]  Shelton married long time girlfriend Kaynette Gern on November 17, 2003.[100] They divorced in 2006.[101]  In 2005, Shelton met singer Miranda Lambert at the CMT's 100 Greatest Duets Concert.[102] Lambert also sang background vocals on his cover of Michael Bublé's song, ""Home"", which became a number-one single on the Hot Country Songs chart. On May 9, 2010, after dating for four years,[103] Shelton proposed to Lambert, after seeking (and receiving) her father's blessing.[103][104] Shelton and Lambert were married on May 14, 2011, in Boerne, Texas.[103]  On January 17, 2012, Shelton's father, Dick, 71, died in Oklahoma, following a period of declining health.[105][106] Shelton's brother, Richie, died in 1990 as a result of a car crash when Blake was 14 years old. Blake and Lambert wrote about Richie in Lambert's song, ""Over You"". The song was named CMA Song of the Year for 2012. It was also named Single Record and Song of the Year at the 2013 Academy of Country Music Awards.[107]  In July 2015, Shelton and Lambert announced their divorce. The couple released a statement, ""This is not the future we envisioned and it is with heavy heart that we move forward separately. We are real people, with real lives, with real family, friends and colleagues. Therefore, we kindly ask for privacy and compassion concerning this very personal matter.""[108] Their divorce was finalized later that same day.[101] In late 2015, it was announced that Shelton had started dating his colleague from The Voice, Gwen Stefani.[109]  In 2015, Forbes estimated Shelton's annual income at $28.5 million.[110]  On June 6, 2017, HLN aired a special called Our Journeys Home, in which Shelton and HLN Morning Express host Robin Meade were revealed to be fourth cousins.[111]  On October 12, 2019, Shelton officiated at the wedding of Trace Adkins and Canadian actress Victoria Pratt in New Orleans, Louisiana.[112]  Philanthropy [ edit ]  In October 2013, Shelton donated $20,000 to the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation following a concert in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The donation was used to support the department’s outdoor education programs. After the donation, Shelton said ""The Wildlife Department's youth education efforts are an important way to get kids back outdoors.""[113]  In September 2016, he donated $600,000 to the Jimmy Everest Center, a University of Oklahoma College of Medicine hospital for children with blood cancer and blood disorders. This donation followed a pair of Shelton’s concerts in Oklahoma City which generated the funds that he donated. Shelton claims he has a personal tie to the hospital as his cousin’s daughter Aspen was diagnosed with cancer and treated at the facility.[114] He created the Blake Shelton Cancer Research Program at that same hospital.[115]  In February 2018, Shelton donated $50,000 to his home town of Tishomingo, Oklahoma. He raised the money from ticket sales at his restaurant Ole Red.[116]  On March 13, 2019, he performed a private concert at his Ole Red Gatlinburg location, celebrating its weeklong grand opening. Shelton earned $29,214 from ticket sales and, along with $25,000 from Ryman Hospitality Properties, donated the sum of $54,214 to the Gatlinburg-Pittman High School’s music programs.[117]  For a short time at the end of March 2020 into the beginning of April 2020, Shelton reduced the price of his merchandise and donated a portion of his sales to the MusiCares COVID-19 relief fund.[118]  In April 2020, Shelton donated $150,000 to the “Give from Home Day” fundraiser, a partnership between Oklahoma City ABC affiliate news station KOCO 5 and the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma with the goal to help feed the hungry during the COVID-19 pandemic.[119]  Discography [ edit ]  Studio albums  Tours [ edit ]  Headlining  Barn and Grill Tour (2005)  Hillbilly Bone Tour (2010)  All About Tonight Tour (2011)  Well Lit & Amplified Tour (2012)  Ten Times Crazier Tour (2013–2015)  Blake Shelton 2016 Tour (2016)  Doing It To Country Songs Tour (2017)  Country Music Freaks Tour (2018)  Friends and Heroes Tour (2019–2020)[121]  Supporting  Shock'n Y'all Tour (2002, with Toby Keith)  Here's to You Tour (2005, with Rascal Flatts)  Me and My Gang Tour (2006, with Rascal Flatts)  H2O II: Wetter and Wilder World Tour (2011, with Brad Paisley)  Filmography [ edit ]  Record as coach on The Voice [ edit ]  Shelton has been a coach on NBC's The Voice since its inception in 2011.

14139,"They say lightning never strikes twice, but Black Lightning is coming back for Season 2 this fall. The CW's non-Arrowverse superhero series enjoyed an electrifying first year, and it set up some epic confrontations for the upcoming sophomore season. Here's everything we know about Black Lightning Season 2.  When does it premiere?  The Season 2 premiere, titled ""The Book of Consequences: Rise of the Green Light Babies,"" will air on The CW on Tuesday, October 9 at 9PM. It will be followed by a new episode on subsequent Tuesdays.  Which characters and actors are in Season 2?  Cress Williams will return as the titular superhero. In his civilian guise of Jefferson Pierce, he's a father of two and a high school principal, but he came out of superhero retirement in Season 1 to fight crime as Black Lightning once again. The first season ended with Jefferson escaping a near-death situation, but by the episode's conclusion he and his family had unearthed a government conspiracy and were enjoying some much-overdue public recognition.  Nafessa Williams returns as Jefferson's older daughter, Anissa Pierce. In Season 1, she learned she had metahuman powers like her father, and eventually became his crimefighting ally under the superhero name Thunder. She is also TV's first black lesbian superhero. China Anne McClain plays Jennifer Pierce, the younger Pierce daughter. She develops electrical powers just like her dads by the end of Season 1, and seems poised to join the family crime-fighting team, though we don't see her suited-up in the Season 2 trailer.  Credit: The CW  Black Lightning will also be aided by his oldest friend and super-suit tailor, Peter Gambi (James Rema), the mildly antagonistic but well-meaning deputy police chief Billy Henderson (Damon Gupton), and his ex-wife, Lynn Stewart (Christine Adams).  The main villain of Season 2 will be the same as before, though if anything Tobias Whale is even more dangerous than he was last season. Played once again by Marvin ""Krondon"" Jones III, Tobias leads the villainous gang the 100 that's plaguing the city of Freeland and has connections with the corrupt metahuman agency the A.S.A. When Season 1 ended, Tobias had opened a case that appeared to contain the tools he'd need to defeat his longtime foe Black Lightning once and for all. Charlbi Dean, who plays his henchwoman Syonide, has been spotted in the Season 2 trailer, same with Jordan Calloway's Painkiller, who used to be Jennifer's boyfriend Khalil before becoming a villain.  Sofia Vassilieva, who recently appeared on Supergirl, joins the cast as the DC Comics hero Looker. The member of the Outsiders superhero team was alluded to in Season 1, but it's unclear how, exactly, the character will be portrayed in the show.  What happened in Season 1, again?  The trailer The CW released over this summer's San Diego Comic-Con wasn't a preview of Season 2 so much as it was a pretty tight, 5-minute recap of the first season. It's worth watching if you need to get caught up, but the tl;dr is that Black Lightning has come fully out of retirement, joined by at least one of his two superpowered children. His arch-foe Tobias Whale hasn't been defeated, and is perhaps even more of a threat now. Oh, and there are several of pods full of teenagers with metahuman powers given to them by the A.S.A. that are just waiting to be saved and/or unleashed.  Video of Black Lightning - Comic-Con 2018 Trailer  What will happen in Season 2?  The first real trailer for Season 2 came out on September 4, and it shows Black Lightning and Thunder getting ready to kick all types of villainous butt — and Tobias, Khalil, and Syonide are ready to dish out some pain, too. Tobias, in particular, looks pretty confident in his plan, but there haven't been many details about what, exactly, he'll be up to in Season 2.  In an interview with Fandom Wire, Cress Williams teased that Season 2 would focus on Jennifer's grappling with her powers, hinting that it would not be as easy an acceptance as Anissa's. ""It's not going to be the same as season one, where um, Anissa just embraced [her powers] and was ready to fight crime,"" he said. ""I think It's going to be a little bit more of a struggle, and from what I'm told we're just going to go harder  Video of Black Lightning | Guess Who's Back Trailer | The CW  Will there be a crossover with the Arrowverse?  No — well, at least, not yet, according to the folks behind Black Lightning. From the beginning, Black Lightning has stood apart from the CW's other connected superhero shows like The Flash, Arrow, Legends of Tomorrow, and Supergirl. In January of this year, co-executive producer said there would be no crossover. ""I say this with all due respect, but [the Arrowverse is] not really relevant to the show that we're doing,"" he said.  Star Cress Williams dashed further cold water on hopes for a crossover in that Fandom Wire interview when he said he didn't think there would be a crossover in Season 2, noting that Black Lightning shoots in Atlanta while all the other Arrowverse shows film in Vancouver.  However, even if a crossover doesn't happen this season, it feels like it's bound to happen eventually. As Arrow star Stephen Amell said at April's Awesome Con in Washington, D.C., ""Everyone pretends like we're not going to eventually crossover with Black Lightning but we're probably gonna crossover with Black Lightning because that's just the way that the world works.""",real
9036,"In July this year, cyber crooks launched a cyber attack on the database of Hollywood Box Office(HBO) to steal 1.5 terabytes of proprietary data which includes few episodes of “Game of Thorns- Season 7”.  After getting hold of the data, the hacker named “Mr. Smith” demanded a ransom of several million dollars worth in bitcoins in exchange of the leaked data. Furthermore, the hacker issued a warning to the HBO officials that if they fail to pay the ransom within a couple of days, the leaked data will be dumped onto the dark web.  When FBI was pressed into the probe, it discovered that the data was leaked as soon as the hackers got hold of the email credentials of Leslie Cohen, HBO’s Vice President for film programming.  Since, HBO failed to react to the hacker’s call, few episodes of “Game of Thornes” containing the water mark “ HBO is Falling” were leaked to the web. After two days time details such as emails, financial balance sheets, employment agreements and marketing strategies also emerged on the web.  On Wednesday night this week, a hacking group named “ OurMine” gained access to the Twitter accounts of HBO. It left a message to the HBO that “ Ourmine is here, we are just testing your security- Please contact us to upgrade the security-ourmine.org→ contact”  A second tweet which surfaced this early morning on HBO’s official twitter page reads “Let’s make #HBOHacked Trending!”  The other twitter accounts linked to the HBO’s official twitter page were also hacked and that includes the accounts of shows such as “Last week Tonight”, “Veep”, “The Leftovers”, “Looking”, “Silicon Valley”, “True Blood”, and “Vinyl”  When contacted, HBO said that the investigation on its twitter hack is still going on and so asked the press to wait for the latest to publish.  And in another incident which stands as a faux pas, one of the upcoming episode of “Game of Thorns” was accidentally aired on HBO Nordic and HBO Espana Platforms for 1 full hour. The channel authorities later learned about the blunder and apologized for the technical blooper created by some of its staff members.",real

555,"A report alleging that Blake Shelton will pop the question to Gwen Stefani with an expensive engagement ring on Valentine’s Day is untrue. The rumor was started by Hollywood Life on Monday when it claimed The Voice judge had been shopping for a $500,000 diamond ring to have when he asks his lady love to marry him. As an insider told the website, one of Shelton’s assistants had recently been shopping with a private jeweler in Beverly Hills.

7243,"When HGTV launched in 1994, the likes of Mr. T and former Bachelorettes weren't front and center. The first iteration of the network featured many traditional interior designers and gardeners, and leaned less on celebrity style. And while we just as giddy over today's Property Brothers as the next fan, we can't help but pine for the classic shows of HGTV's infancy, too.  1. Room By Room  HGTV  Good ol' Matt Fox and Shari Hiller launched HGTV's very first show with Room by Room, which highlighted easy DIY projects and lots of kitschy touches (case in point: this baseball bathroom). The designing duo (who are not married, if you're curious) still hold the record for the longest-running HGTV show, and today, you can catch up with them and their go-to cornice boards on their blog.  2. Designer's Challenge  HGTV  Before DIY decorating was trendy, Designer's Challenge had traditionally minded designers compete against each other (very civilly, of course) to win big-budget projects.  And yep, that's Chris Harrsion (the host of The Bachelor) in front of those floating circles. His new show might be a bit sexier, but we bet he misses the thrill of a good mood board (a.k.a. the original Pinterest board).  HGTV  3. Gardening By the Yard  HGTV  We're not sure we've come across a more enthusiastic home gardener than the mustachioed Paul James. After all, it takes a true yardwork devotee to want to waltz with a rake.  4. Decorating Cents  HGTV  On Joan Steffand's no-nonsense show, you got just $500 to redecorate a room — and the outcome was often very colorful.  5. Designing For the Sexes  HGTV  On this classic show, designer Michael Payne helped opinionated couples (and sometimes, their gigantic dogs) meet in the middle on tough decorating choices.  6.

Scroll down for video  'I don’t know how we survived as a couple': Elsa Pataky reveals the secret struggles that put 'pressure' on her marriage with Chris Hemsworth  Chris and Elsa met in early 2010 and married shortly after in December that year.  They welcomed their daughter India in 2012 and their twin sons, Tristan and Sasha, later in 2014.  'We were married and then a year after we had kids. It puts a lot of pressure on a marriage,' the Fast And The Furious actress admitted.  However, after recently celebrating their eight wedding anniversary, Elsa claims the couple couldn't be happier or more in love.  'It puts a lot of pressure on a marriage': Spanish actress Elsa has revealed she and actor husband Chris Hemsworth did struggle during the early years of their marriage  'Every marriage has ups and downs – it’s constant work to be in a successful marriage and stay together forever': Elsa claims their marriage is stronger than ever as they recently celebrated their eight-year wedding anniversary  'I think our years together have been great. Every marriage has ups and downs – it’s constant work to be in a successful marriage and stay together forever.

The family of five now live in Byron Bay on the New South Wales' North Coast after relocating from Los Angeles.

And the Thor star recently spilled about how he really feels about false rumours about his relationship making headlines.  Speaking to The Times in January, the former Home And Away star admitted he tries to avoid reading the rumours because they irritate him so much.  'I just try to ignore it,' Chris told the publication of how he deals with the reports.  'I stay off the internet but occasionally someone says to me, ""You might want to react to this one."" Most of the time I'm like, ""Why did you even tell me that? There's nothing I can do about it. It just p**ses me off.""'  'There's nothing I can do about it. It just p**ses me off""' Speaking to The Times in January, the former Home And Away star admitted he tries to avoid reading the rumours because they irritate him so much  It's not the first time the pair have expressed frustration about the 'rocky romance' rumours, with Chris previously taking aim at a specific publication.

3852,"It has been seven years since Jennifer Aniston and John Mayer called it quits.  But according to Andy Cohen, the iciness between the actress, 47, and the singer, 39, still hasn't thawed.  According to an excerpt from his new book Superficial, which was obtained by Radar Online, the pair had an extremely 'awkward' run-in earlier this year.  'Awkward': Andy Cohen has revealed that exes John Mayer and Jennifer Aniston had a run-in earlier this year. They are seen here in 2009 at the hotel where they bumped into each other  Andy revealed that he was meeting his close friend John for a drink at the popular Sunset Tower hotel in West Hollywood and found Jennifer sitting with her Friends co-stars Lisa Kudrow and Courteney Cox at the only other table there.  The 48-year-old said he 'began asking John when was the last time he saw Aniston, how awkward this was, and if there were ways I could make it more awkward'.  Andy added: 'We realized they had to walk by our table to leave and that would be a ""moment."" We wondered if it was more fun at our table or theirs.'  Snubbed: The Friends star (shown in September) apparently ignored the singer (pictured last month) when they were seated near each other at the Sunset Tower hotel  The Watch What Happens Live host suggested that John join him in going over to say hello, but that John made it very clear this would be a bad idea.  'He told me with a look that the Queen of Smartwater would not be having it,' he wrote.  According to Radar, Andy and John left first and the bitter exes didn't have to come face to face.  Juicy: Andy, who is close friends with John, recalled the encounter in his new book Superficial  John and Jennifer dated on and off for a year from 2008 to 2009.

4718,"Andy Cohen says he is ""completely stunned"" by Kathy Griffin's claims that the talk show host offered her drugs on multiple occasions  Andy Cohen says he is “completely stunned” by Kathy Griffin‘s claims that the talk show host offered her drugs on multiple occasions.  Cohen responded to a 17-minute long video titled Kathy Griffin: A Hell of a Story in which the comedian claimed he asked her if she wanted to do cocaine before appearances on Watch Happens Live with Andy Cohen.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I am completely stunned by this story. It is 100% false and totally made up,” he tweeted Saturday, the same day the video was posted.  Griffin, 56, spoke directly into the camera as she made multiple claims against Cohen.  “Both times I did the show, right before we went live, Andy Cohen privately asked me in an office if I wanted to do blow,” she alleged. “I’ve never had a drink in my life. You guys know I’m no prude but I’m kind of like a straightedge, I thought he was kidding the first time.”  Image zoom Charles Sykes/Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty  The actress continued, “I was hoping he was kidding, the second time I do the show, same thing. So once again we’re alone in an office and he’s like, ‘Wanna do some coke?’ And I’m thinking, ‘He’s serious!’ Trust me, he’s going to say he’s kidding and everything, no. He was asking me to do cocaine with him, that made me very uncomfortable.”  Griffin added that Cohen was a “miserable boss” while her show, My Life on the D-List, aired on Bravo for six seasons.  “The whole time I was working there, I didn’t know how Andy Cohen wanted to be me … I didn’t know Andy Cohen was on the red carpet, trying to be funny and asking questions on BravoTV.com,” she said. “I didn’t know when they ended The D List and I desperately wanted to do a talk show, Andy Cohen would be the first television executive in the history of television to give himself a talk show — which seems to get picked up every season.”  The video comes after Cohen pretended he didn’t know the comedian. Asked about replacing Griffin on CNN’s New Year’s Eve Live, Cohen smiled and told TMZ, “Who? I don’t know her.”  The jab is a reference to Mariah Carey‘s infamous remark about not knowing Jennifer Lopez — “apparently I’m forgetful,” she quipped to Cohen on Watch What Happens Live in 2016.  Griffin retaliated on Twitter, pointing out that the stars have known each other for years.  “Even when it’s on tape, there are doubters? He is NOT kidding w paps. Was my boss for 10 years. Treated me like a dog. Deeply misogynistic,” she wrote.  Cohen, 49, announced he’s joining longtime friend Anderson Cooper on the broadcast earlier this month. Griffin co-hosted with the venerated journalist for 10 years, but CNN cut ties with the comedian in May after she posed for a photo with a mask of President Donald Trump‘s bloodied head in her hand.  RELATED VIDEO: Kathy Griffin Apologizes for Donald Trump Beheading Photo: “I Went Way Too Far”  In her video, Griffin also took aim at TMZ founder Harvey Levin, accusing him of being complicit in quieting scandals surrounding Harvey Weinstein.

9251,"At The Amazing Spider-Man 2 premiere in April 2014. Getty  Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield broke up in 2015, after dating for four years. I don't know Emma or Andrew (although I saw them once at the movies in New York and gave them what I firmly feel was a kind, encouraging smile), but when they broke up, I felt a little sad. Then I was pleasantly surprised. Unlike other young celeb exes, many of whom throw shade or never let the drama die after a breakup, these two have repeatedly proven that it's humanly possible to have a civil — even lovely! — relationship with your ex. Now that awards season is ramping up, we're getting to see their elegance in full swing.  It helps that the breakup didn't come with any nasty press leaks (I still don't know exactly why they split) or bad words said about one another. When they've been asked about their past relationship, or when the other has come up in interviews, it's all love. Last month, in The Hollywood Reporter's Actors' Roundtable, Andrew was asked who he'd bring with him on a desert island. His answer? ""Emma Stone. I love Emma."" And no, I don't think that was an ""I love you, Emma, come on the desert island and get back together with me!"" (Although, maybe.) It was more that thing where you date someone and they're fabulous, but it's just not quite the right fit. Despite the genuine love, maybe you're just meant to hang out as friends. (Andrew and Emma were spotted together in London around his birthday this past summer.)  At the premiere of Magic in the Moonlight in July 2014.  As for Emma, when she did her 73 Questions video with Vogue in October, she was asked about the best gift she's ever received, and she said it was a rocking chair. In 2015, Andrew did an interview with Vanity Fair where he mentioned making someone a rocking chair. Interesting.    And yet. You'd be naive not to wonder, What if all this ""we're exes, and it's super chill"" is a Hollywood act? Both parties have potential Oscar nods this year (Andrew for Silence, Emma for La La Land), and the fact that they've been able to stay on such positive terms definitely looks great for both of them. I'm charmed, after all; maybe Oscar voters would be too.  Surviving awards season together at the 17th annual AFI Awards this month. Getty  From the start, Andrew and Emma have been a massively endearing couple, arguably to the point where you've had to wonder: Is this too good to be true? Did they just get together to promote Spider-Man? Andrew told Teen Vogue of their meeting during casting for the movie, ""It was like I woke up when she came in. She was the last person to screen-test, and I was so bored of it by then that I was mucking about ... And then she came in, and it was like diving into white-water rapids and having no desire to hang on to the side. Throughout shooting, it was wild and exciting. I couldn't help but try to stay with her, keep pace with her, and not let her get away."" Swoon. Makes you want to see the movie, right?  At The Amazing Spider-Man premiere party in June 2012.  Whatever the truth of their relationship, you can't argue that they've set a classy example for how to be Hollywood exes — and exes in general, really. Maybe we can't all be friends with our one-time romantic partners, but if Andrew can leap up to give Emma a standing ovation when she wins Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical at the Golden Globes, surely we can find it in our hearts to wish our own exes the best.

He expanded on that sentiment in a Facebook Live interview with Entertainment Tonight, saying:  We've been together 18 years, Josh and me ... We've been so close, it was just one of those things where you know, I'd been talking to him, and he's been telling me about the engagement. And then I saw [the wedding] on social media. So it was just one of those things where it was just like, 'You didn't even tell me?! I had to find out on social media?' And then you're like, 'You know what?! Fine!’ And then I'm like, 'Wait, I probably shouldn't have done that.'  The guys attended the MTV Video Music Awards in August and shared matching Instagram posts to prove that all was forgiven.

Caitlyn Jenner vs. The Kardashians  Getty  Caitlyn Jenner released her memoir, The Secrets of My Life, on April 25, sharing some less than flattering details about her relationship with Kris Jenner, to whom she was married for nearly 25 years. ""My heart breaks for my mom,"" Kim Kardashian West said on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. ""I don’t think it’s necessary. I just feel like it’s unfair, things aren’t truthful.""  Among other things, Caitlyn claimed that Kris had total control of her finances when they were married and that it was Caitlyn who came up with the idea for Keeping Up With the Kardashians, not Kris. ""It’s taken her a really long time to be honest with herself so I don’t expect her to be honest about my mom now,"" Kim told Ellen. ""But it’s just so hurtful. I wish her all the success in the world, but not at our expense.""  In October, on the season-14 premiere of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Kim more pointedly called Caitlyn a ""liar"" and ""not a good person"" for writing that Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty but joined his defense team anyway. ""If you talk about my dad,"" Kim said, ""I will cut you."" Later in the episode, Khloé called Caitlyn a ""bad, mean person"" and Kris cried via FaceTime about feeling blindsided by her ex's memoir.    Speaking to students at the U.K.’s Cambridge Union in November, Caitlyn said she hadn't talked to Kim in a year. (And she'd previously said she hadn't talked to Kris since the release of her book.) ""It’s been a little tough over the last couple of years on the Kardashian side,"" she said, according to the Cambridge News (via Us Weekly). ""To be honest, I don’t talk to them anymore. Kim I haven’t talked in a year. They don’t want me in their lives, they bashed me pretty badly. It’s devastating when your kids do that. It really hurt. I don’t know what the future holds. We will see.""  3. Justin Bieber vs. Marilyn Manson  Getty  Last year, Team Bieber sold a repurposed Marilyn Manson t-shirt designed by Fear of God for $195 at Barneys, but according to Marilyn, they did so without his permission. Marilyn told Consequence of Sound that Justin was wearing the t-shirt when they met ""and he said to me, 'I made you relevant again.' Bad mistake to say to me."" Marilyn claimed to eventually get ""all the proceeds from those shirts,"" without Justin's team even putting up a fight, and he called Justin a ""real piece of shit in the way he had the arrogance to say that.""  ""He was a real touchy-feely guy, too, like, 'yo yo bro!' and touches you when he’s talking. I’m like, you need to stand down, you’re dick height on me, ok? Alright? So stand down, son.""  In a conversation with Howard Stern, Marilyn put the beef to rest by sharing a text exchange initiated by Justin, which Stern read on air. ""I thought we had a pretty pleasant interaction,"" Justin texted. ""Also, if anything wasn’t squared away with the T-shirts, I’m so sorry. Anyway, regardless, it kind of stung seeing that I came off as an asshole or even just was an asshole, I’m sorry...""  ""That was exaggerated,"" Marilyn responded. ""You were just being you, no beef here."" He continued:  We are cool. People just made that shirt stuff into a fake feud,” Stern said reading Manson’s text to Bieber. Let’s turn it upside down and f— the press and do something together. It will be the best. And don’t apologize. You weren’t an asshole. They asked if you were and I sort of agreed. I wasn’t out to get you. If not, I’ll try to avoid more questions today on Stern.  If only Justin would apologize for selling the shirt for $195.  4. Camila Cabello vs. Fifth Harmony  Getty  Camila Cabello may have quit Fifth Harmony in December 2016, but the hard feelings carried over into the new year. In February, Camila told Billboard she left the band in part because she took issue with singing ""other people's words.""  ""You have to follow and honor that inner voice,"" she told the magazine ... ""We didn’t write our records. We were interpreting somebody else’s story. Fifth Harmony is an entity or identity outside all of us, and I don’t think anybody felt individually represented by the sound — we didn’t make it."" She also said that she hadn't intended for her departure to be as dramatic or messy as it was, but that she's ""only got love"" for her former band members.  The group was featured in Galore magazine in April, its first cover as a foursome, and although they didn't mention Camila by name, fans read between the lines. Possibly shady quotes included, ""the four of us are really in sync with each other"" and ""for us, communication is really important."" They got more pointed with Billboard magazine in July, telling the magazine, ""Let's just say we’re in a better place now — there are no secrets in this circle.""  The feud-iest moment came at the MTV Video Music Awards in August, when Fifth Harmony mysteriously opened their performance of ""Angel"" with five members onstage — only to boot that fifth person ""into outer-space"" just as the vocals kicked in.  This content is imported from Twitter. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  In a subsequent interview with Radio Disney, Camila didn't directly address the VMAs stunt directly, but said, ""Fifth Harmony represented this confidence and girl power. I wouldn’t be the person or that artist that I feel like I’ve discovered, so I’m super thankful for that experience.""  5. Taylor Swift vs. Katy Perry  Getty  You're probably thinking, Wasn't this a feud from 2014? — in which case, you'd be right. Yet here we are. The feud started with a 2014 Rolling Stone interview, in which Taylor Swift cryptically revealed that Katy Perry was the inspiration for ""Bad Blood.""  ""It had to do with business,"" Taylor said. ""[This person] basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me … So now I have to avoid her. It’s awkward, and I don’t like it."" Katy tweeted:  This content is imported from Twitter. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  Watch out for the Regina George in sheep's clothing... — KATY PERRY (@katyperry) September 9, 2014  Fast-forward to this May, when Katy appeared on a Carpool Karaoke Primetime Special with James Corden after releasing""Swish Swish,"" her Taylor diss track (even if she refused to call it that herself).  ""Honestly, it’s really like she started it and it’s time for her to finish it,"" Katy said. She also gave her side of the ""backup dancers"" story, saying, ""I tried to talk to [Taylor] about it … she wouldn’t speak to me. I do the right thing anytime that it feels like a fumble. It was a full shut-down and then she writes a song about me and I’m like, 'OK, cool cool cool. That’s how you wanna deal with it?'""  Still not done talking about Taylor, Katy then told NME, ""I mean, I'm not Buddha — things irritate me. I wish that I could turn the other cheek every single time, but I'm also not a pushover, you know? Especially when someone tries to assassinate my character with little girls [her fans]. That's so messed up!""  On June 11, Katy seemed to have a change of heart. In an interview with Ariana Huffington on her Thrive Global Podcast, she said she was ""ready to let it go"" and apologize to Taylor. ""I forgive her and I’m sorry for anything I ever did, and I hope the same from her. I think it’s actually like, I think it’s time. There are bigger fish to fry, and there are real problems in the world. You know what I’m saying?"" She added:  I love her, and I want the best for her. And I think she's a fantastic songwriter, and I think that if we, both her and I, can be representatives of strong women that come together despite their differences, I think the whole world is going to go like, 'Yeah, well we can do this.' I don't know. Maybe I don't agree with everything she does and she doesn't agree with everything I do, but I just really, truly want to come together in a place of love and forgiveness and understanding and compassion.  Good call. This feud was getting tired.  6. Taylor Swift vs. Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West  Getty  This feud has spanned nearly a decade. The latest installment to the saga came when Taylor Swift released ""Look What You Made Me Do,"" the first single off her album Reputation. It didn't take a detective, or even a particularly astute blogger, to spot the Kimye references. (""I don't like your little games / Don't like your tilted stage / The role you made me play / Of the fool, no, I don't like you."") Other songs off Reputation seemed to address the feud as well.  The Kardashian-West's didn't respond to the album explicitly, but some took Kim's hanging out with Katy Perry on the day Taylor's album dropped as a swipe at the snake-affiliated pop star.  7. Jay-Z vs. Kanye West  Getty  During his Saint Pablo tour last year, Kanye West went off on his long-time collaborator and friend Jay-Z. Among his grievances were a falling out they had over some ""Tidal-Apple bullshit,"" the fact that their children had never played together, and Jay-Z’s failure to reach out to Kanye after Kim Kardashian-West was robbed at gunpoint in Paris. He also criticized Beyoncé, saying, ""Beyoncé, I was hurt cause I heard you said you wouldn't perform [at the Grammys] unless you won Video of the Year over me and over 'Hotline Bling.'""  Jay-Z responded on his album 4:44, which came out in June. On ""Kill Jay-Z,"" he raps, ""But you ain’t the same, this ain’t KumbaYe/ But you got hurt because you think KumbaYe/ You gave him 20 million without thinkin’/ He gave you 20 minutes on stage, fuck was he thinkin’?/ 'Fuck wrong with everybody?' is what you sayin’/ But if everybody’s crazy, you’re the one that’s insane."" And on ""BAM,"" Jay-Z seemed to reference Kanye’s ""30 Hours"" — in which Kanye raps ""I hit the gym, all chest no legs"" — with the lyric ""Uh, n*ggas is skippin’ leg day just to run they mouth."" As Consequence of Sound points out, ""BAM"" also samples ""Bam Bam"" by Sister Nancy, which Kanye samples on ""Famous.""  8. Tyrese Gibson vs. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson  Getty  In September, Tyrese Gibson commented on The Rock's Instagram to express his dismay that Fast & Furious 9 might be delayed in favor of a spinoff about The Rock's character, Hobbs. ""If you move forward with that #Hobbs Movie you will have purposely ignored the heart to heart moment we had in my sprinter,"" he wrote, according to E! (the comment has since been deleted). ""I don't wanna hear from you until you remember what we talked about. I'm on your timeline cause you're not responding to my text messages – #FastFamily is just that a family… We don't fly solo.""  In October, the Fast & Furious 9 release date was indeed bumped from April 2019 to April 2020.

Liev and I are on great terms and we’re trying to do our absolute best for the sake of the children, and we hope to keep moving forward in that way. He’s fantastic dad, a wonderful, wonderful man, and we still want the absolute best for each other. So, that’s pretty much all I’ll say.”    Unlikely Celebrity Couples  Us Weekly confirmed in September 2016 that Watts and the Ray Donovan actor, 49, split after 11 years together. The pair are parents of sons Alexander “Sasha,” 8, and Samuel, 7.  “I feel I’m in a good place in my life and I want to make sure my kids are healthy, my kids are happy and things are going to go well. Those are my hopes for me and for all of us,” Watts told Australia’s Daily Telegraph in November. “I feel, whether you’re famous or not, transitions are scary for anybody. I feel like change is always scary, but that’s only because transition for anyone is new, and you wonder how things are going to go.”    Love on Set  Watts and Schreiber first met in 2005 on set of their film The Painted Veil.",real

11714,"Trio night brought back a few fan favorites from previous seasons of Dancing with the Stars, including Alfonso Ribeiro, Laurie Hernandez and Corbin Bleu.  While it's always super exciting for fans to revisit the greatest hits, it does present a new hurdle to tackle for the pros. They not only have one non-dancer to whip into shape, they have a second partner who hasn't been dancing their heart out for the past eight weeks. Even worse, not all celebs are made equal, and some newbies' shortcomings were much easier to notice when put next to previous winners. Logic follows, not everyone could hack it, and someone had to go home.  Terell Owens and Cheryl Burke, Dancing with the Stars Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC    Terrell Owens & Cheryl Burke - Charleston - ""Bad Boy Good Man"" by Tape Five (feat. Henrik Wager)  The dance: The Charleston is always going to look weird on lanky dancers since you have to flail your limbs around at twice the average speed of an African swallow. Terrell didn't necessarily look totally graceful, but he managed better than I expected. The fast feet never tripped him up, and considering he had a trio Rumba to learn this week too, he kind of rocked this routine.  What the judges said: For once, Len was actually all about the different dance styles besides Charleston incorporated into this routine. That's a first. All the judges also agreed that Terrell is the most improved star on the show this year, which means something.  Score: 27/30  Very nice, Terrell! Very nice!  Drew Scott & Emma Slater - Waltz - ""Both Sides Now (Torch Songs)"" by Years & Years  The dance: This waltz was all about Drew's relationship with his fiancee — if you couldn't tell, he shoved his way through the crowd to give her a kiss after he finished — and the emotion was definitely there. I also bet his fiancee is excited to have him learning how to waltz right before they walk down the aisle. Unfortunately, Drew's missteps continued this week, and a few less-than-graceful mistakes meant a much lower score than he earned last week.  What the judges said: ""Your intentions were very very clear and deeply felt,"" Bruno complimented, but while the emotions were there, the footwork kind of wasn't. Drew had some shaky turns that caught the judges' eyes, and after last week's fall, this spells bad news for him.  Score: 22/30  Uh oh... Drew's headed for the bottom of the board again.  Victoria Arlen & Val Chmerkovskiy - Argentine Tango - ""Down"" by Marian Hill  The dance: The last thing you want to hear from a girl who can't technically feel her legs is that she's experiencing pain and spasm right before you go on stage. Victoria's hip spasm during dress rehearsals put everyone on edge, but she soldiered through it for the show. Other than a serious injury, Victoria's biggest problem was bringing sexy back. According to her, she was never sexy to begin with, preferring to be a cheesy dork most of the time instead. If the fact that Val laid her down on the floor and crawled on top of her when they finished is any indication... she was plenty sexy.  What the judges said: The judges loved the lines and the form, but they could tell she was trying a little too hard to master the intensity and the sex appeal of the dance. Dancing these routines requires a lot of acting (just ask Frankie Muniz), and that's not Victoria's forte.  Score: 24/30  Blame it on the spasm, girl. I would.  Lindsey Stirling & Mark Ballas - Samba - ""Morning Drums"" by Gregor Salto  The dance: Lindsey's rib injury didn't carry over into this week (strange...), but being back at 110% meant she could effectively pretend to be a lion in the circus for this Samba. Then again, did anyone else think this week's choreography was a little tame compared to the wild acrobatics and fast footwork of all her previous routines? Maybe Mark took it easy this week in order to keep her in good health. It wasn't her best routine to date, but she's not getting eliminated until she makes this slow pace the new normal.  What the judges said: Len agreed, saying Lindsey looked less sure-footed than normal. It was full of ""rhythm and imagination,"" but ultimately the hip action was lacking. Carrie Ann thought she brought out her inner-Beyonce, which is probably the greatest note to ever get.  Score: 26/30  Lindsey blamed the ""awkward white girl"" in her, which is kind of fair, to be honest.  Frankie Muniz & Witney Carson - Viennese Waltz - ""Perfect"" by Ed Sheeran  The dance: I'd like it printed on my headstone that I doubted Frankie Muniz's ability to perform on this show, and it's my biggest regret to date. Frankie and Witney made it to the top of the leaderboard last week, and this week they proved why. Ed Sheeran probably did a lot of the work, making this a super romantic number, but Frankie and his awesome lines didn't hurt. Seriously, there's almost nothing this guy can't do. He's my dark horse bet.  What the judges said: Carrie Ann called it the closest thing to perfection except for when Frankie briefly lost control of Witney (which led to some sort of inappropriate comments from Tom), but Len thought it was as far from perfection as you can get. I love it when the judges fight. I start screaming ""FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!"" at my TV screen like an idiot.  Score: 26/30  Take off the shirt next week, Frankie. You'll be back on top.  Jordan Fisher & Lindsay Arnold - Quickstep - ""Chuck Berry"" by Pharrell Williams  The dance: When you have a minute to rewatch this season, I want you to watch Jordan Fisher's facial expressions while he dances and try not to smile. I dare you. He really was born for the quickstep, and if his faces are any indication, he loved dancing it. Everyone else has sort of muscled their way through it, and he's floated. Even the loud blue suit couldn't detract from his stellar performance.  What the judges said: Carrie Ann called it ""brilliant and sassy"" and HOLY CRAP, Len stood up and applauded. That kind of says it all.  Score: 30/30  Are we even surprised? He's our MVP!  Frankie Muniz and Witney Carson, Dancing with the Stars Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC  Trio Dances  Terrell Owens & Cheryl Burke & Kelly Monaco - Rumba - ""Slow Hands"" by Niall Horan  The dance: I'm not sure I'm totally down with Kelly promising Terrell a date if they got three 10s, especially considering the sexual nature of their trio dance, but if everything's consensual then more power to 'em. Speaking of that dance, Terrell cashed in on those stellar abs of his, and he even showed off some sexy hip action too. I mean... who wouldn't want to date him?  What the judges said: Carrie Ann (and every female audience member) was loving the sex appeal, but she thought he was capable of more than what he did on stage. That's kind of a compliment, right?  Score: 24/30  Way to c*ck block, guys.  Drew Scott & Emma Slater & Rashad Jennings - Cha Cha - ""Get Up Offa That Thing"" by James Brown  The dance: Could anyone even see this routine with all the glitter-jackets and mirror balls and sequins in this routine? Keeping up with Rashad is hard for any dancer (hello, reigning champ), but for a dancer who's got little to no rhythm to begin with? Super hard. Drew lost the beat a couple times, but I did noticed his body rolls were way more soulful than normal.  What the judges said: The judges noticed that he didn't quite make muster on the ""soul"" aspect, especially when put next to Rashad, whose hips absolutely don't lie. He did, however, do a good job of keeping up in general, so he got good notes overall.  Score: 25/30  Guys, Drew kind of deserves to be on the chopping block. There, I said it.  Victoria Arlen & Val Chmerkovskiy & Laurie Hernandez - Jive - ""Magic"" by B.o.B (feat. Rivers Cuomo)  The dance: When Laurie and Victoria weren't geeking out over Star Wars, they were having a ball (get it?). Two olympians and a pro dancer made for an awesome trio, and their dance went off without a hitch. Unfortunately, this was another case where a more talented alum was paired with a less than fantastic newbie, and Victoria looked pretty stiff next to Laurie's awesome shaking and jiving. I'd blame it on Victoria's spasms though because did you guys see that back brace? And she switched to tennis shoes instead of heels for this dance. I hope she's okay!  What the judges said: Even Carrie Ann and Bruno had to agree that Victoria fell out of step next to Laurie and Val. The trio isn't sharp until everyone's sharp, and they didn't quite get there tonight.  Score: 24/30  She deserves at least one more week to prove she can win this thing.  Lindsey Stirling & Mark Ballas & Kristi Yamaguchi- Jazz - ""Let's Face The Music And Dance"" by Seth MacFarlane  The dance: Okay, this dance proved why trio night was a good idea. It was unclear before now, but Mark, Lindsey, and Kristi really brought it home. When you have three people who know what they're doing, it works like a well-oiled machine, and everyone goes home happy. Lindsey definitely got her groove back in this routine with fast feet and a few awesome lifts. That's more like it, girl!  What the judges said: ""It was like I paid money to see that!"" Carrie Ann said, and that practically makes Lindsey a pro now, right?  Score: 28/30  Anyone who smells his partners shoes to make sure they're working hard deserves at least one 10.  Frankie Muniz & Witney Carson & Alfonso Ribeiro - Jive - ""Good Place"" by Leo Soul  The dance: The child actor factor was strong in this trio, and watching Alfonso buck Frankie up was kind of the cutest thing ever. The audience loved the routine so much they wouldn't stop cheering. Maybe it was for the Carlton fake out? That had me laughing. Frankie might have had doubts about how long he'd last in this competition, but I definitely don't. He's finals material. Let's all just pretend we didn't hear that cringeworthy plug for America's Funniest Home Videos.  What the judges said: Bruno attributed their awesomeness to Witney's good influence, and I kind of agree. She's the best pro to have as your partner in my opinion. The judges did notice Frankie's nerves this time around, but they also thought all three people in this trio complemented each other perfectly.  Score: 27/30  Not too shabby!  Jordan Fisher & Lindsay Arnold & Corbin Bleu - Salsa - ""Que Viva La Vida"" by Wisin  The dance: Wow. Just... wow. Every week I wonder if Jordan Fisher is really as good as I think he is, and then every week he does something like that. The lifts and the tempo and the footwork were so fantastic, it's hard to believe any of these three kids weren't born dancing the salsa. Plus, the Corbin/Jordan team up was worth it just to hear the story of Jordan watching High School Musical for the first time and getting inspired by Corbin to start acting/dancing/singing.  What the judges said: For once all of Bruno's flailing felt totally earned. ""Hashtag amazeballs? Triple fire emoji?!"" Carrie Ann couldn't even speak English anymore, this dance was so awesome. They even said this dance would go down in Dancing with the Stars history!  Score: 30/30  Another perfect score?! This guy is in it to win it!  LINDSAY ARNOLD, JORDAN FISHER, LINDSEY STIRLING, MARK BALLAS, NIKKI BELLA, ARTEM CHIGVINTSEV, CHERYL BURKE, TERRELL OWENS, Dancing with the Stars Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC  Elimination: The show started off with the strongest first, announcing Lindsey and Jordan would both be in the semi-finals. Victoria was a bit of a surprise considering how she danced tonight, but that's fair enough. For a hot minute, I was terrified my Frankie would be going home, but ultimately it was time for Terrell Owens to pack his bags as he and Cheryl were eliminated... despite scoring a very good score of 27 earlier.  Dancing with the Stars airs Mondays at 8/7c on ABC.",real
12930,"Simone Biles can now officially add ""honorary Houston Texans cheerleader"" to her resumé, right below ""Olympic gold medalist."" Casual.  The Team USA gymnast was gifted a pair of the squad's legendary red boots on Friday, making her the first-ever ""honorary"" member. She then showed them — and her cheer-tastic moves — off on the field during Sunday's game against the San Francisco 49ers, E! reported.  ""Game day feels,"" Simone wrote on social media ahead of her big debut. ""So excited to dance at the Houston Texans Game!""  The Houston native posed for photos alongside the rest of the red-boot-wearing team and also posted one of her ""short/tall"" pictures with retired basketball pro Hakeem Olajuwon, who stands more then two feet taller than Simone (she's 4'9,"" he's 7'0"").  This is hardly the first time Simone has solidified her chops as a dancer and a gymnast — or in this case, both at once. The 20-year-old famously appeared on this year's cycle of Dancing With the Stars and was eliminated in a way that left many fans outraged. After receiving two perfect scores from the judges, Simone was still sent home, which many considered to be a direct result of the response she dished to a host who told her to ""smile"" while receiving criticisms.  ""Smiles don't win you gold medals,"" she replied at the time, which became the #clapback heard 'round the world and will forever be commemorated with #smilesdontwinyougoldmedals merch.  Even so, Simone was all smiles for her afternoon on the field with the Texans. ""I had such an amazing experience cheering at the Texans Game ❤️ Definitely a memory to last forever!"" she captioned a postgame shot on Instagram. While it doesn't appear that she'll be swapping #teamUSA for #teamTexan in any permanent capacity, here's hoping those red boots make some sort of appearance at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.

19478,"There’s usually no time for fine dining in busy royal schedules, but romantic Prince Harry found some free time on Wednesday to treat his new wife to lunch at one of Dublin’s best-known restaurants.  Harry had his aides book a table for two at the fashionable Delahunt restaurant, where the couple enjoyed a two-course meal washed down with half a pint of Guinness and some strong Irish coffee. They headed to the restaurant after spending the morning visiting Croke Park and Trinity College, where massive crowds were there to greet them. Lunch, then, was a moment for peace and quiet; the venue was closed to the public so that the royals could enjoy their meal in peace.  “The booking was made some time ago, and they had pre-ordered their meals,” manager Grace Davis told Vanity Fair. “They had the smoked salmon starter. Meghan had the hake for her main course; Harry had the lamb. They had planned to have dessert too, but said they were too full by the end of their meal. So they just had what we call our 3fe Dublin roasted coffee. They seemed to love it—it was empty plates all around. They even shared a half-pint of Guinness, and Harry had a Coke.”  Meghan is a self-confessed foodie and loves to eat out. While a quick lunch on the go is usually the order of the day for royal tours, the prince wanted to treat Meghan to an authentic Dublin experience, to mark the end of what has been a very successful—and enjoyable—tour.  The couple were joined by British Ambassador to Ireland Robin Barnett and their team of Palace aides, but ate alone on leather seats in the restaurant’s snug, which is tucked away at the back of the restaurant close to the kitchen.  “They were very warm and friendly and very happy together,” Davis said.“This was their only downtime on the tour, and they were chatting the whole time over lunch. They were also very engaging, and both of them popped into the kitchen to see our chef, Dermot Staunton. Harry told him, ‘I hear it’s the best food in Ireland,’ and Dermot told him it was, but that he is biased.”  After lunch, the couple headed to the Famine Memorial and the Epic museum to learn about the stories of the country’s 10 million emigrants. They also visited a co-working space for technology start-ups.  There was one final walkabout before they departed for England in time for the World Cup match against Croatia. It seemed soccer—and babies—were on the couple’s minds. When they met the Adam-Stewart family from Sandymount in Dublin, who were waving an England flag, Harry told mum Elaine that five children was too many. “I told Harry my husband has red hair, and he gave me five children, and asked him, ‘When are you and Meghan going to get going?’” Adam-Stewart said afterward. “Harry laughed and said five’s too many.”  Meanwhile, Meghan seemed thrilled to have had the chance to return to Dublin, and told well-wishers, “It’s been amazing and so, so special being here.” Judging from the size of the crowds, the feeling was mutual.",real
19620,"Yet another major pop culture player is foregoing a San Diego Comic-Con panel this year, with HBO announcing that neither ""Game of Thrones"" nor ""Westworld"" will be present at the annual fan event.  In a statement, the premium cable outlet explained that the omission of its two biggest series from Comic-Con was a purely logistical choice, noting that ""production schedules and air dates"" for the splashy series conflicted with the July event.  Here are HBO's remarks in full:  ""Due to production schedules and air dates for Game of Thronesand Westworld, these series will not be presented at San Diego Comic-Con this summer. HBO has a longstanding relationship with SDCC, and we are very grateful for the fans' enthusiastic response over the years. We look forward to returning in the future.""  HBO has offered a ""Game of Thrones"" panel every year since the show's premiere. Skipping it now, ahead of the launch of the show's eighth and final season in 2019, seems more than a little anti-climactic. And while ""Westworld"" only made its Comic-Con debut last year, it seemed by all accounts poised for another buzzy panel in 2018, following all of its season two shakeups.  Of course, HBO isn't the only notable name that won't be presenting a panel in Hall H this year: Marvel is also passing on that noteworthy annual event, instead simply offering fans a floor exhibit honoring 10 years of the MCU. But according to Deadline, HBO won't even be doing that, skipping any sort of Comic-Con presence entirely (and that includes a rumored sneak peek at one of the potential ""Thrones"" spinoffs). Bummer.  Regardless of those glaring absences, Comic-Con will be overflowing with other offerings -- more information can be found here. The event runs from July 19 through July 22.

1321,"While everyone else you knew was binge-watching ‘Stranger Things’, Selena Gomez & The Weeknd were going through a nasty breakup. Now, looks like The Weeknd is easing his pain with Eleven & the gang — but is he also taking shots at his ex?  You’re not in the Upside Down: Selena Gomez, 25, and The Weeknd, 27, really have broken up following the shocking reveal of her rekindled friendship with ex Justin Bieber. It’s been hard to gauge how the pair are really dealing with the split; Selena looked all smiley with fans hours after the news broke, while Abel was seen dancing his heart out with other girls at the club. Still, we may have gotten our first indication that there is some anger over this breakup, and it’s coming directly from The Weeknd’s Twitter account. Late on Halloween night, he took to his page to share with his fans,” Dodging STRANGER THINGS spoilers is the hardest thing I’ve ever experienced…” Um, REALLY? Harder then breaking up with your girlfriend of 10 months? Interesting…  Whether this tweet is a subtle slam at Selena, we couldn’t say. What we have heard is that it was The Weeknd who pulled the plug on his romance with Selener, and that it had nothing to do with JB. “Abel enjoyed being single before he met Selena and felt unfairly tied down in a relationship that had lost its passion,” TMZ claims. Meanwhile, sources have told us EXCLUSIVELY that Abel is ready to move on quickly now that he and Selena are donezo. “Knowing Selena is spending time with her ex Justin, Abel has been forced to move on too and more quickly than he expected. Call it revenge hookups if you want, but Abel is moving on fast after being annoyed by seeing Justin and Selena together,” a source close to the singer tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  dodging STRANGER THINGS spoilers is the hardest thing I’ve ever experienced… — The Weeknd (@theweeknd) October 31, 2017  Well, if you want our advice, Abel, it might serve you better to hunker down and binge the second season of ‘Stranger Things’ rather than get frisky with new girls too soon. You’re coming out of two very serious relationships, between Selena and Bella Hadid, and it could be time to have some ‘me’ time. Grinding in the club might be fun, but it will it really help you get over this breakup?  HollywoodLifers, what do you think? Is The Weeknd juggling some bitter feelings over the breakup?

69,"Ben Rhodes operated mostly behind the scenes during his eight years inside the Obama White House. He was a speechwriter, Deputy National Security Advisor and, increasingly, a confidant to a president not known for letting down his guard. Rhodes' book, The World As It Is: A Memoir of the Obama White House , opens and closes with Obama's reaction to the election of Donald Trump. In between, it recounts world events in a newsy, intimate chronology that Joe Klein, in the New York Times Book Review , called ""a classic coming-of-age story, about the journey from idealism to realism, told with candor and immediacy."" Rhodes spoke with TIME in New York City on June 4.  The book is filled with fabulous fly-on-the-wall stuff. I mean, in this case you're a talking fly, but did Obama read the book, and say yes to all that?  He read it, but he read it kind of in the galleys. I think he wanted to be respectful that this was my story. He's writing his own book, so I was kind of going through an accelerated version of what he's going through in writing his own book. We talked a lot about the balance between telling a good story and creating a first draft of history.  I felt that showing him as a three-dimensional human being would help people understand him better. Not every single thing is flattering, but obviously I have positive views about him and his presidency. One of the real goals of the book is to take Barack Obama and make him a three-dimensional, living, breathing, talking person who is quoted not just at the head of the situation room table, but in the presidential limousine, and backstage, and when he's relaxing at the end of the day. I wanted to convey that human side.  You seem to be more than just a speechwriter or Deputy National Security Adviser. What was your relationships like with Barack Obama?  The book traces the arc of the 10 years that I worked for him. At the beginning of that period, he's this intimidating, distant figure to me. I walk into a conference room, and I'm afraid to even offer my views because I was nervous to speak in front of him. Then you fast forward to the end of the story, and I'm sitting there with him in the presidential limousine leaving his last foreign trip, and we're talking about everything under the sun. How I got from being afraid to walk in the room to diagnosing what happened in the election and hearing his own second thoughts about how things were ending, that's the arc of our relationship. We went from that distant to that intimate in this 10-year period.  After Donald Trump won, Obama mused in the back of a limo, ""Were we too soon?"" What did you take that to mean?  Demographics. He said to us, ""This country's going to change. You know, there's gonna be a Latino Barack Obama and an Asian Barack Obama."" But the demographic tipping point hasn't happened. He caught lightning in a bottle in 2008 and kind of cut the line. He was young. Again, the demographics hadn't shifted. So I think what he was wrestling with at the end there was that Trump was able to cobble together enough of a backlash constituency rooted in grievance — a largely white coalition — in a way that frankly would not be demographically possible 10 or 20 years from now.  It's satisfying to read his observations about race and understandable grievance that he never expressed publicly. Were there people telling him at the time, ""Maybe it would be useful if you did""?  No, I think probably the preponderance of advice he got was to not speak that much about race. He said that he was really jolted early in the presidency when he made that comment about Skip Gates getting arrested in his house. For an African American it was a very obvious point, that that doesn't happen to white people. But there was this huge backlash. He had to have this hokey beer summit. I think the general sense is that he was damned if he did, damned if he didn't.  But it would come out in private moments of catharsis. He would be preparing for a press conference and we'd say, ""Well, you may be asked, 'Is some of the opposition you face about race?"" And he joked, ""Yes. Next question."" Or we'd talk about how to discuss the Black Lives Matter movement and the backlash to that, and he'd say, ""Well, cops should stop shooting unarmed black kids.""  You knew he wasn't gonna actually say that, but he would come out in this gallows humor because to him, of course so much of this antagonism towards him is about race. I came to see that as an African American, he had priced that in on the front end of this journey. So he didn't wallow in it. He just saw it as part of what he had to wake up with every day and deal with as president.  Was he the most disciplined person on Earth? Or does it just seem that way given who's president now?  He was the most disciplined person I've ever been around. He had this remarkable capacity to focus on what he needed to do. There was a very interesting memory I had writing the book. It was at the height of the Benghazi freak out, which was related to me. I'm getting savaged in the media. FOX News is chasing me into my apartment building. He called me into his office and he said, ""I understand you've been having a hard time."" I kind of apologized. You feel like a burden, you know? ""Yeah, I'm sorry. It's a mess. And I know you deal with this type of thing all the time."" He looked at me, and he said, ""Well, did you do anything wrong?"" I realized in that moment that nobody had ever actually asked me that question. I said, ""No."" And he said, ""Well, what are you worried about then? Just get back to work.""  That's part of the discipline. You can get so angry or distracted by the environment around you as president, but he had the discipline to just come to work every day and think, ""If I am confident that I'm trying to do the right thing, that's all I can control. You know, I can only control what is in front of me.""  That doesn't mean he was always right, by the way. It just means that he had kind of a barometer for what he did. Frankly, that fast forwards to today. People ask me, ""He must be so upset about what Trump is doing."" I actually think he takes a view of life like, ""I did what I could control. And I feel good about what I did. And I'm not gonna sit here and agonize because I don't view this personally. I view it as I did what I thought was best, and history will play out."" So the discipline was not just the mental and physical discipline to get up and do the job every day. It was this ability to not get knocked off course by all the things that are surrounding you as president.  Obama's speeches always articulated ideals. And now we have a president whose speeches never do. Trump's UN General Assembly speech mentioned ""sovereignty"" 41 times.  It sounded like the Russian or Chinese view of the world.  So what is the effect of that?  One of the things I was struck by in this job was how much the words of an American president mattered around the world. People cared about what the American president said and what Barack Obama said in a way they didn't care about what Xi Jinping said or Vladimir Putin. Whether we were in Africa, or Latin America, or Europe, I would have the bizarre experience of going back to a place years after he had given a speech there, and people could quote the words back to you. Often it was the pieces about values.  In a lot of places, if the American president and the American government is not talking about values, there's not some other person who's going to do that. I think people in this country can under-appreciate how important that is in places where concepts like freedom are far more contested.  It's hard to track down specific consequences, though, isn't it? It's a matter of identifying something that's not happening that might otherwise be happening.  I'll give you some examples. People will say to us, ""You did this opening to Burma. And look what happened. You had this ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya."" I don't know if we could have prevented that. I do know what we would be doing. He would have spoken out about it. He would have called Aung San Suu Kyi. We would have called the Burmese military. We would have organized the other Asian countries to put pressure on Burma. Hopefully we would have at least contained some of that. When the Kenyan election happened, everybody could see for months that you were gonna have ethnic violence and it wasn't gonna go well. But there was not a sense that the United States was speaking out, was calling the leaders, was organizing the African Union.  This stuff is not necessarily the glamorous headline-grabbing pieces of American foreign policy. But over time if the stitching of the international order is beginning to fray, then the seams begin to tear. In places like Venezuela, and Myanmar, and the Philippines, and Kenya, lives could be put in danger. You could have democratic backsliding. Again, that's not to say we had it perfect. It just — we were fulfilling the role of America as it has been fulfilled for decades. I think it's gonna take people some time to observe the cost of what Trump is doing. One of the things you learn in government is there's a long tail to American decision-making when it comes to foreign policy. Moving the embassy to Jerusalem, pulling out of the Iran deal, pulling out of Paris, not speaking up for democratic values — the world doesn't end the next day.  The question is a year from now, two years from now, three years from now: Is war more likely? Is authoritarianism more entrenched? Are democratic voices more marginalized? I think in our social media-driven consumption of information, the cost of what Trump is doing is not gonna become apparent until next year, the after that, and the year after that.  Was the villainy of Russia registering at the time as significant? Or did it seem more so from the post-election perspective, given what they were up to in the campaign?  When you look back, there were two inflection points. One is when Putin came back into power. Obama said to me, ""We didn't fully appreciate just how much Medvedev was pushing out ahead of probably what Putin was comfortable with."" There was this dramatic shift when Putin came back in. Everything became more hostile, from me being gratuitously tailed by Russian spies when I was negotiating in secret with the Cubans in Toronto, to Edward Snowden being granted asylum, to Putin telling us he had no interest in arms control negotiations, to Putin essentially becoming a brick wall on trying to solve the Syrian crisis.  And then after Ukraine happened — Putin I think interpreted the protest that ousted the Ukrainian president as the Americans coming into Russia. He thought we were behind those protests. He drew no distinction between Ukraine and Russia. I'd sit in the Oval Office and listen to these endless conversations where Putin would steer everything back to his view that we had overthrown a democratically elected government in Yanukovych. He was gonna punch back, although he didn't say that expressly. But that's when we started to see fake news and we started to see the use of social media bots. We started to see kind of outward lying. We started to see the release of intercepted communications to suit Russia's political narratives. So all of that set the stage for what happened in our election.  I say in the book you cannot understand the Russian meddling in the 2016 election without understanding the Russian response to Ukraine. It was all the same tools. It was information warfare essentially that they had developed in Ukraine, just set loose in the United States.  In the book there's a moment where Obama says China is ""fragile."" What did you take that to mean?  He had just finished giving this speech in Hiroshima that is entirely about the need for countries and human beings to contain their worst impulses. He made a joke to me when we got in the limo that we should send that speech to Putin and Assad and ISIS, and the kind of worst actors. I said, ""Yeah, and Xi."" And he said, ""Well, actually that's wrong. The Chinese are not expansionists. They are about consolidating control of China. And that's in part because they're fragile.""  I think his belief was that if you look at the history of China, a weak and fractured China can become much more dangerous to its own people and to the world than a cohesive China. That China has not sought to conquer foreign lands, beyond what they consider part of China, like Tibet. They have sought to consolidate control of what they have. His view was that the United States needs to accept a large, competent, strong China not just because that helps the Chinese people and hundreds of millions of people come out of poverty, but ultimately because a fragile China, a China that's falling apart, would be much more dangerous for us in the long run.  In the book, Obama says some U.S. voters probably felt they had more in common with Vladimir Putin than with him. Was that prescient?  Well it is frustrating, because Obama takes this kind of long view of history. Part of his message to Americans in 2014, '15, and '16 when we had all of this drama with Russia and a lot of controversy around our foreign policy is, ""We're much stronger than these people. We're the stronger actor. We have the strong economy. We're the one with allies. He is operating in a position of weakness — that's why he's lashing out. So I'm gonna squeeze him, but I'm also not going to go to war with him in Ukraine.""  He understood Putinism, and how the same forces were in the United States — that kind of tribal, nostalgic brand of politics that is constantly looking to the past. ""Make America great again,"" is not that different from Putin's nostalgia for the Soviet Union or tsarist Russia. He saw those forces at play, I think. The interesting thing is people thought he saw them late. He actually saw them earlier. And part of the reason he wasn't more exercised is that actually he had learned to kind of live with that brand of politics, and not just in the United States but around the world.  That brand of politics has the wind at its back with this administration.  The very last thing he said to me as we were sitting in the limousine before he got on Air Force One for the last flight home from a foreign country was, ""We're about to find out how resilient our institutions are at home and abroad.""  I think the basic point he's making there is if the constitutional order we built in the United States and the international order that we've built since World War II can withstand Trumpism, the pendulum will swing back to a more progressive and inclusive brand of politics. But if those institutions break — we could be in a different world. And the answer to that question is uncertain. I think he believes that we will be okay, but it's never a guarantee.  Is it surprising that someone so charismatic believed in institutions?  That's a fascinating question. He is at his core an institutionalist. You make change incrementally. You know, Mandela was his hero. I spent a lot of time talking to him about Mandela when he was preparing his eulogy. Mandela was a guy who didn't come in and just eviscerate the existing institutions. He sought to co-opt them. He brought white South Africans into his government. I mention in the book that Obama's own father suffered because of a country, Kenya, that had a revolution without institutions. He basically went back and found no place for a technocrat because it was all corruption and tribalism. Those forces ultimately completely marginalized him.  Then in Indonesia, as a child he lived there right after, literally tens of thousands of people had been killed because there weren't strong institutions. He, unlike any other American president, had in his DNA and family experience an understanding that institutions are the thin veneer between civilization and either anarchy or tyranny.",fake

13487,"Laura Dern is holding court. As the Big Little Lies star, 50, stepped out of the Beverly Hills Hotel on December 20, NBA star Baron Davis was doting on her. An eyewitness tells Us Weekly that following a lunch date where the pair were “talking, laughing and having a great time,” the athlete, 38, carried the actress’ purse as the duo packed on PDA. Although Dern, who divorced Ben Harper in 2013 after eight years of marriage, was “trying to remain incognito,” says the observer, they “were kissing and touching and were all over each other.”  The duo, said the eyewitness, looked “infatuated with each other” and “very much like a new couple in love.”  Since her split from Harper, Dern has remained relatively mum about her romantic life, although she was reportedly linked to Common last year. Davis’ wife of three years, Isabella Brewster, filed for divorce in June and requested primary physical and joint legal custody of their 3-year-old and 1-year-old children.  In January, the actress had a brief awkward run-in with her ex-fiancé Billy Bob Thornton at the 2017 Golden Globe Awards. As the Goliath actor, 62, briefly walked behind Dern on his way to the stage to accept an award, the exes appeared to avoid eye contact and Dern briefly looked down. Dern opened up about her 1999 split from Thornton – when he famously left her for Angelina Jolie – during a past interview with Talk magazine. “I left our home to work on a movie, and while I was away, my boyfriend got married, and I’ve never heard from him again,” she said, via ABC News. “It’s like a sudden death.

HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVE details inside how she kept it a secret from her family and stayed reclusive in her healing process.  She did it! Caitlyn Jenner made the final step towards becoming a woman by undergoing gender reassignment surgery and she did it with super secrecy.“Caitlyn was very private and reclusive after her reassignment surgery. It was something that she had been thinking about for a long time and she wanted her body to heal after the surgery given the risks of complications,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  The 67-year-old even kept the news of the procedure from her own family members! “For her it was the final stage to becoming a woman and she did not really discuss it with her immediate family. Caitlyn had fully talked about the procedure with her doctors and her other transgender friends, so, she fully knew what was involved and was totally prepared,” our insider adds.  The former reality star reveals in her upcoming memoir that, “You want to know, so now you know. Which is why this is the first time, and the last time, I will ever speak of it.” While she doesn’t go into in-depth detail, the former Olympian says that having a penis had “no special gifts or use for me…I just want to have all the right parts. I am also tired of tucking the damn thing in all the time.”  She had the surgery in Jan. 2017 and decided to share the news “so all of you can stop staring,” and says that she feels “not only wonderful but liberated.

3036,"It was a humid 84 degrees in Bridgehampton on Saturday, but that didn’t stop a crowd of people from descending upon Topping Rose House for Jill Zarin’s annual luncheon. The former Real Housewife of New York, ran around the grounds in an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, posing on the step-and-repeat, taking photos with fans, and catching up with old friends. Trying to track her down for an interview turned into a scavenger hunt.  Scattered around the lawn were tables for vendors selling everything from wine to sex toys. There was a station for guests to get a vitamin infusion, with seats in the direct line of the sun transforming the spot into an inescapable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid. Housewives from across the country flew into town for the occasion (Vicki Gunvalson of Orange County and LeeAnne Locken of Dallas), which also served as a benefit for Thyroid Cancer Research in honor of Zarin’s late husband, Bobby, who died of the disease in January.  Upon first try to flag Zarin down for a couple of questions, she sent over her daughter, Ally Shapiro, in her stead. Shapiro reflected on last year’s luncheon, when her stepfather was still struggling with cancer, but encouraged her and her mother to party on.  “He loved drinking and partying. This was the highlight of his year,” she said. “It was this time last year that we were told he wasn’t gonna make it another week, and he pushed us and he said, ‘Go to the party. Maybe I won’t be here when you come back, but go.’”  Shapiro, who now lives in London while she works on her master’s degree, admits that she can’t watch old episodes of Real Housewives, which showed her as 14-year-old struggling to get close to her stepfather. “You want to think that it’s like a home movie, but it’s not. That’s not what our relationship was like,” she said, adding that the reruns play constantly in the U.K. “I’m walking down the street and someone’s like, ‘Oh my God, I just saw you trying on a prom dress!’”  She also said that her mother is dabbling with dating, specifically with a man she plays tennis with. “It’s fun, and I live in London so it’s good for her to have a distraction.”  Dina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set and a pair of oversized aviators, arrived fashionably late to the affair, but was immediately greeted by hoards of people trying to chat her up or get a photo. Eventually secured in the same spot for more than a few seconds, she was willing to talk about her daughter Lindsay’s upcoming project for MTV, a Vanderpump Rules–inspired reality show that follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Bunim/Murray Productions is producing the series, the same company that produced Lohan’s E! reality show Living Lohan a decade ago.  “These kids were like, babies, and now they’re running the show,” she said of the crew. “They lived in my house! And now they’re all corporate. . . . We’re home. It’s cyclical, you know.”  Lohan also revealed that the upcoming series is a bit of a family affair with Lindsay’s younger sister, 24-year-old Ali, providing the theme song.  A friend of Lohan’s interjected, asking if Ali, like her older sister over a decade ago, had moved out to L.A. for work.  “She’s in New York with me,” the matriarch answered. “I keep them close! I’m not going to lose someone to L.A., no. Not again!”  Finally, the woman of the hour managed to stop and take a breath. While Zarin may no longer be a Bravo housewife, she still knows how to schmooze like one. She’s been keeping up with the latest season of the show here and there, and even received a good-luck message from Luann de Lesseps, who checked into rehab earlier in the month, wishing her good luck on the event. Having brought me up to speed, Zarin closed our conversation with a plug for her new line of “pet-proof, gorgeous, and inexpensive” rugs, aptly titled Jill Zarin Rugs.

2034,"A Justin Bieber fan has been arrested at his Los Angeles home after visiting the property for the third time in the space of a week.  The unnamed woman, 40, was reportedly apprehended by the Los Angeles Police Department at the singer’s Beverly Hills home after she visited with the intention of going looking for him.  According to TMZ, Bieber’s security team detained the woman until police arrived and booked her for trespassing.  Advertisement  Bieber is believed to have been at home during the incident but he did not meet the woman.  The latest break-in attempt comes after fans were caught trespassing on two separate occasions previously.  In 2015, two fans were seen attempting to gain access as one celebrated her 12th birthday, filming their efforts on their mobile phones.  Only a year previously, a fan had gained access to his rented mansion in Atlanta, Georgia, and was found sleeping in one of the bedrooms within the home.  At the time of the incident, Bieber was on holiday with his father Jeremy.

14335,"Tom Petty’s cause of death was an accidental overdose, his family said in a statement on his website and social media on Friday.  “Our family sat together this morning with the Medical Examiner – Coroner’s office and we were informed of their final analysis that Tom Petty passed away due to an accidental drug overdose as a result of taking a variety of medications,” read the post, written by his widow, Dana, and eldest daughter, Adria.  Petty died after suffering from cardiac arrest on Oct. 2. According to a statement from the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner, obtained by Variety, the musician was taking several medications, including Fentanyl, oxycodone, Xanax, Restoril, and Celexa. Prince died of an overdose of the painkiller Fentanyl in April of 2016, according to an autopsy report.  The coroner’s report lists Petty’s official cause of death as “multisystem organ failure due to resuscitated cardiopulmonary arrest due to mixed drug toxicity.”  Petty was found at his unresponsive at his Malibu home on Oct. 2 and was taken to the UCLA Medical Center, where he was placed on life support. However, he could not be revived and died hours later.  In their statement, Petty’s family named a litany of health problems the musician faced, “including emphysema, knee problems and most significantly a fractured hip.” The hip injury worsened, the family explained, while Petty was on his most recent tour.  “On the day he died he was informed his hip had graduated to a full on break and it is our feeling that the pain was simply unbearable and was the cause for his over use of medication,” the statement went on.  “On a positive note we now know for certain he went painlessly and beautifully exhausted after doing what he loved the most, for one last time, performing live with his unmatchable rock band for his loyal fans on the biggest tour of his 40 plus year career,” it concludes. “He was extremely proud of that achievement in the days before he passed.”  Like most rock musicians who came up in the 1960s and ’70s, Petty experimented with drugs and alcohol — marijuana is prominent in the photos from his and the Heartbreakers’ 1976 debut album, and he told biographer Warren Zanes that he’d faced challenges with cocaine use (particularly in the 1980s), alcohol and, in the wake of his 1996 divorce from Jane Benyo, heroin. He said he became clean in 2001.  Petty was laid to rest in a private funeral in Pacific Palisades, Calif., on Oct. 16. Read the full statement below.",real
10971,"Last November, Thor:Ragnarok star Tessa Thompson, who played the scene-stealing Valkyrie, generated massive excitement among fans when she revealed that the women of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) had pitched an idea for an all-female MCU blockbuster to studio president Kevin Feige.  The prospect of seeing Valkyrie, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) all together in the same team-up was practically too much for Twitter to handle.  Alas, it may have been too good to be true.  While speaking with Thompson at the Tribeca Film Festival, where her fantastic neo-western Little Woods premiered, the Marvel, Creed and Westworld star admitted that the excitement around an all-female Marvel movie may have been a bit premature.  “I don’t know. That was kind of an offhand thing, and then the press really ran with it,” Thompson told Observer. “The extent to which the press ran with it is also an expression of what ripe a time it is for something like that. That people are hungry for it, that people are interested in it.”  Admittedly, Marvel does seem to be making more of an effort on that front when you look at the studio’s upcoming release schedule.  “I think, regardless, Marvel is making their Black Widow movie and they are doing Captain Marvel and the female characters in the big team-up movies tend to be, at least for me, some of the strongest elements,” she said.  Still, we would have loved to see all of those badass heroines duking it out on-screen.  While Thompson didn’t rule out the possibility entirely, fans will need to look forward to Marvel’s exciting upcoming features in the meantime, as it doesn’t sound as if the all-female team-up is a high priority at the moment.  Larson’s Captain Marvel will be the first female-led blockbuster from Marvel following the massive success of rival Warner Bros.’ Wonder Woman. The character is expected to make her debut in a brief appearance in Avengers: Infinity War and her 2019 solo adventure, the only MCU flick in-between Infinity War and Avengers 4, will take place in the 1990s and will likely set up the final film with this current roster of Avengers.  Variety reported back in February that Marvel had hired screenwriter Jac Schaeffer to pen a script for a Black Widow solo film. Fans have been clamoring for Johansson’s character to receive her own spinoff for years, but the previous Marvel regime was reluctant to give the project a greenlight.  We’ll continue to hold out hope for Thompson’s vision (no pun intended) to become a reality.",real
12923,"There is no safe space in America where the country’s culture wars aren’t being waged — not even the make-believe workshop of a shopping mall Santa Claus — and no ears so innocent that they haven’t heard about the sexual misdeeds of some prominent men and accusations against others.  That, at least, was the twisted Christmas spirit of the “Saturday Night Live” cold open this weekend, in an episode hosted by James Franco and featuring the musical guest SZA. Indeed, the first half of the show frequently returned to the many sexual misconduct scandals roiling powerful men and the institutions that once protected them — including Senator Al Franken, the “S.N.L.” alumnus who said on Thursday that he would resign his seat as he faced allegations from at least six women of groping and improper advances.  The show’s pointed and effective opening sketch, which featured Kenan Thompson as the would-be Santa and Kate McKinnon as his elfin assistant, began with a boy asking Mr. Thompson for traditional gifts like Mega Bloks and Lazer Tag.  “And,” the boy added, “can you tell me, what did Al Franken do?”  Mr. Thompson was understandably taken aback. “O.K., wow, let’s see,” he said. “I think I can handle the Mega Bloks and the Lazer Tag. Can you take the Al Franken thing, Sugarplum?”",real

(Photo by Desiree Navarro/WireImage)  Melissa Joan Hart might have once raised eyebrows for voting Republican, but the actress says she's far from the only conservative in Hollywood.  Fox News spoke with the former child star this week and broached the subject of her political stance. The interview recounted the time Hart said her ""Sabrina the Teenage Witch"" costars were shocked to learn she voted for Bob Dole over Bill Clinton during the 1996 presidential election.  ""Yeah there were some jaws dropping on the set that day,"" Hart, who was 20 at the time of that election, told Fox in an interview published Tuesday. ""These days I find more [Republicans] in Hollywood and I love having a healthy debate with anyone. Nobody's one way or the other. I feel that unfortunately in this country there are only two parties. I wish there were more because nobody fits into one or the other.""  When asked how things have changed politically in the industry during the last 20 years, Hart responded: ""There's definitely been some fellowship, which is nice. On 'Sabrina' when that happened I was pulled aside by the Republicans on the set. I was able to discuss it in a safe environment. These days I'm pretty much surrounded by Republicans at work. It's made it a little easier but I love talking to my Democrat friends about how they see things.""  Shortly after the election last year, Hart told Fox's Sean Hannity that she ""learned a lesson"" the day she voted for Dole.  ""It schooled me in the fact that you just don't talk about politics in Hollywood, and most people don't think the way you do,"" she said. ""But, I quickly found out kind of behind the scenes that a lot of people do feel that way. A lot of people do vote Republican ... but they're afraid to say it ... It is sort of like a blacklist. It's a little scary.""  Hart has long been forthright about her support of the Republican party, but that didn't sit well with some last November during the 2012 election.  The actress recently sat down with HuffPost Live and discussed the stir she caused after announcing on Twitter that she was voting for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.  ""I got called every name in the book,"" Hart said. ""[People wrote] that they hope I die, and that they hope my children are gay, which is somehow supposed to be some sort of punishment. [...] The hate was really unbelievable just from that simple tweet. Just by saying I was voting.""",fake

2895,"CLICK HERE if you are having a problem viewing the photos on a mobile device  Brad Pitt’s image as the architectural savior of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina’s destruction is being questioned in a new report that alleges that a number of homes built by his nonprofit in the Lower Ninth Ward are falling apart.  The report by the Daily Mail also suggests that the actor, in the wake of his nasty breakup from Angelina Jolie, has lost his passion for fulfilling his original commitment to build 150 affordable, durable and environmentally efficient homes.  The Daily Mail recently visited New Orleans’ Lower Ninth Ward, where many homes belonging to black and low-income families were swept away after levees of the city’s industrial canal were breached during the hurricane 13 years ago.  Post-Katrina, the humanitarian-minded Pitt and Jolie swooped in to the city and bought their own elegant French Quarter mansion, while Pitt set up the nonprofit Make it Right to help regenerate the Lower Ninth Ward.  Architectural enthusiast Pitt, 54, promised the nonprofit would build 150 new homes using cutting-edge design that would emphasize safety and adherence to LEED platinum building standards.  Make it Right spent at a minimum of $25 million to build brightly painted, architecturally distinct homes that were sold to Lower Ninth Ward residents at a discount, though residents told the Daily Mail they cost around $150,000 each — or market value.  Now, residents are telling the Daily Mail that some of the homes didn’t live up to the promise offered by Pitt or by his nonprofit, saying that the homes contain structural flaws and are now falling apart.  Daily Mail published photos showing some of those homes, with roofs caving in, wood rotting and walls collapsing or falling away from the house. Some residents used their life savings, combined with federal relief funding, to buy the homes. But some found they couldn’t keep up with the repairs and have abandoned them, the Daily Mail added.  Resident Constance Fowler told the Daily Mail that her next-door neighbors in a Make it Right home had to move out because the wife was getting sick from the mold. Make it Right promised to renovate the house, but workers found its roof was beyond repair, Fowler said. The house was left unoccupied and rotting away. Fowler told the Daily Mail she had to repeatedly petition Make it Right and the city to tear it down.  “Make It Right says this is the largest green community in the United States,” Fowler said to the Daily Mail. “Look how many are boarded up now or abandoned.”  “People have problems with porches, roofs, walls falling apart,” she added. “There’s six out of seven homes right next to me that have had significant repairs.”  Another resident, Doris Wyman, said she and her husband Henry are only able to stay in their Make it Right home because Henry is a skilled handyman.  “I’m concerned about neighbors’ homes,” she said. “Just because mine is holding up, I know others are falling apart, their walls, roofs and porches.”  Wyman said Make it Right may have brought people back to the Lower Ninth Ward, but ultimately failed in its mission if people can’t stay in their homes. She acknowledged that the intention probably was “beautiful” but asked, “Where did they go wrong?”  Pitt used to be a regular presence in the neighborhood and at the Make it Right headquarters, the Daily Mail said. But residents told the Daily Mail they haven’t seen him for a couple of years.  The New Orleans Times-Picayune reported in May 2015 that Pitt and Jolie, then Hollywood’s premier globe-trotting super couple, were selling their New York Orleans mansion for $6.5 million.  A representative for the couple insisted at the time that the sale didn’t mean that the couple were wavering in their commitment to the Lower Ninth Ward.  “Yes they are letting go of this property and will look for something more off the beaten path down the road,” the rep said told the Times-Picayune. “In the meantime, they remain committed to, and infatuated as ever with the city of New Orleans, and will continue to focus on growth in the Lower Ninth through the Make It Right Foundation.”  Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt in September 2016, and the couple have since been locked in a bitter, high-profile battle over their divorce and custody of their six children, ages 10 to 16. Pitt also was initially hit with allegations that he was drinking too much and had become violent with their oldest son, Maddox, 16, during a flight from Europe in 2016.  Pitt, facing the biggest scandal of his three-decade career, “turned inward,” E! News recently reported. In a candid 2017 interview with GQ Style, Pitt used an architectural metaphor to describe his recovery from the breakup of his family, saying he relied on therapy, a newfound sobriety and plenty of solitude to strip down “to the foundation and break out the mortar.”  With regard to his focus on Make it Right, a source close to Pitt insisted to the Daily Mail that the actor has visited New Orleans several times over the past few years and continues to make the organization a priority.  “In addition to personally being there, he continues to dedicate significant time and financial support to this project,” the source said. “This is an ongoing project for both Make It Right and for Brad — who has personally donated his time and millions of his own dollars to ensure the community is revitalized and the project continues as scheduled.”  In a phone interview from Los Angeles with the New Orleans Times-Picayune in 2015 — the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina — Pitt said he had recently visited the Lower Ninth Ward. He delighted in how the neighborhood had become an “oasis of color and the solar panels.”  Pitt told the Times-Picayune he also had talked to residents sitting on their front porch. He asked them how their new homes were working out.  “Good,” he said they told him. “And I say what’s your utility bill? And they’ll throw something out like, ’24 bucks’ or something, and I feel fantastic.”  At the same time, Pitt admitted to the Times-Picayune that he and the organization had been “incredibly naive” in understanding what it really takes to rebuild a community.  “We went into it incredibly naive,” he told the newspaper, “just thinking we can build homes — how hard is that? — and not understanding forgivable loan structures and family financial counseling and getting the rights to lots and HUD grants and so on and so forth. So it’s been a big learning curve.”",fake
6938,"A coparenting nightmare! Maci Bookout confessed during part one of the Teen Mom OG reunion episode that she believes Ryan Edwards is doing drugs. The two wouldn’t even get along to talk out their problems on stage during the explosive episode that aired on MTV on Monday, April 16. Also, Catelynn Lowell talked about her suicidal thoughts and treatment while Amber Portwood admitted to relapsing after her breakup from Matt Baier. Check out the biggest moments from the dramatic reunion below.  Maci Thinks Ryan Is Using Again  Maci and Ryan each got their chance to talk about yet another tumultuous year attempting to coparent. Maci has been asking her ex to take a drug test nearly all season so he could see their child, but said she doesn’t believe he is clean.  However, Ryan completely disagrees. “I wonder if she believes the lies she tells?” Ryan muttered backstage.  He talked about his struggle with rehab, admitting that he ended his treatment early and hasn’t really done any post-rehab therapy to help control his addiction. “I didn’t know how I was going to get out and actually stay clean,” Ryan said.  When it was time for the two to come together onstage, Ryan wouldn’t have any of it. “I’m not sitting out here with her,” he said. Hopefully, he calms down during part two so they can try to work out some of their problems.  Amber Discussed Her Relapse  Amber Skyped in to talk about her life, including her dramatic breakup from Matt. She was in such a dark place after being “mentally and physically” abused by him for years that she stumbled in her sobriety and started drinking again. “I definitely was trying to drown my sorrows,” Amber said.  Also, she gushed about Andrew Glennon, the father of her soon-to-be born baby, adding that he is her soul mate and, in a way, saved her life. “He really picked me up before I started doing drugs again,” Amber said. “If it wasn’t for Andrew, I don’t even know if I would be here right now.”  Catelynn and Maci Diss Farrah  Maci and Catelynn were the only two moms physically at the reunion, so they got a chance to discuss Farrah Abraham‘s exit from the show without fear of being attacked by their former costar.  “I feel like she’s always wanted to go down the direction she’s going down so if that’s what she wants to do then that’s probably what she needs to stay doing,” Catelynn said.  Maci was not as diplomatic and said it was so much “nicer” to do the reunion without Farrah there, adding that they also “weren’t really allowed” to talk to Farrah’s daughter. Someone is still bitter!  Catelynn Talks About Her Depression  Catelynn discussed her difficult year — her miscarriage, her suicidal thoughts and being in treatment away from her family. The hardest part for her was thinking about everything she put her daughter, Novalee, through this season.  “When I was in treatment, I struggled with the fact that ‘Am I putting her through the same stuff that my parents put me through?'” Catelynn cried.  She also added that since she returned from treatment, her daughter is constantly scared her mom is going to leave her. “It breaks my heart,” Catelynn said.

2101,"Looks like Margot Robbie is going to need some aloe for this burn! At the Hollywood Film Awards on Sunday, Nov. 5 in LA, Margot, 27, excitedly approached Angelina Jolie to introduce herself. But instead of a warm reply, Angie “curtly replied, ‘I know who you are’ and turned her back on Margot,” an insider exclusively tells In Touch.  According to the source, the Australian-born beauty “looked shocked.” Jealousy may be to blame. When Margot starred in 2015’s The Big Short alongside Angelina’s ex Brad Pitt, “rumors swirled about Brad crushing on Margot and that Angelina had tried to stop Brad from casting Margot in the film,” says the insider.  (Photo Credit: Splash)  The source says that the mom-of-six — who shares Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, Vivienne, 9, and Knox, 9, with Brad, 53 — can’t shake her resentment toward the Suicide Squad actress. “It was clear from Angelina’s reaction to Margot that she still holds a grudge,” the source says.  Back in November 2016, not long after Angelina, 42, filed for divorce from Brad, OK! Magazine reported that the Fight Club hunk was “ready to move on” with Margot. “He thinks she’s the hottest girl in Hollywood right now,” a source said at the time. “This was a sore subject with [Angelina] who blocked them from working together a few times. Now that he’s single again, you can expect Brad to go after Margot with a passion.”  While a romance between Brad and Margot never flourished, the eternal heartthrob has recently fell for 21-year-old British actress Ella Purnell — who, in an ironic twist, played a young Angelina in 2014’s Maleficent. He’s so enchanted, a source previously told In Touch, that he cast her in his upcoming Starz series, Sweetbitter.  “Brad had Ella in mind from the get-go. He went out of his way to cast her,” said the source. “Ella is incredibly flattered by all the attention she’s getting from Brad.

16236,"Jude Law is no longer the uncharacteristically cool young pope, but instead a dapper young Albus Dumbledore, as seen in two new photos from Warner Bros.’ upcoming sequel, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.  Law can be seen as Dumbledore in the photo below, sitting in what appears to be an office, as seen by the stack of books and quill on the desk behind him. Warner Bros. did not provide any information on who the man lurking over his shoulder is. Dumbledore has always been rather laid back, even in the face of certain death, but there’s a new essence of cool surrounding his younger self.  Just for added effect, here’s a behind-the-scenes photo of a young Albus Dumbledore talking to a young Newt Scamander.  Another interesting photo released today gives us a better look at Johnny Depp’s controversial Grindelwald. Depp was cast as Grindelwald in 2016, taking over for Colin Farrell, who technically played the role in 2015’s Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, although he hid under the guise of a man named Graves. Depp’s casting was met with scorn from fans, who argued that after allegations arose of Depp’s alleged domestic abuse of ex-wife Amber Heard, he shouldn’t be involved in the film.  Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling later published a blog post announcing her support of Depp in the role, writing that “the filmmakers and I are not only comfortable sticking with our original casting, but genuinely happy to have Johnny playing a major character in the movies.”  Depp’s version of the character is much different than Farrell’s, and can be seen in the photo below standing beside actress Poppy Corby-Tuech, who will play Vinda Rosier, one of Grindelwald’s most trusted followers.  The full synopsis for The Crimes of Grindelwald can be read below:  At the end of the first film, the powerful Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) was captured by MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America), with the help of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne). But, making good on his threat, Grindelwald escaped custody and has set about gathering followers, most unsuspecting of his true agenda: to raise pure-blood wizards up to rule over all non-magical beings. In an effort to thwart Grindelwald’s plans, Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) enlists his former student Newt Scamander, who agrees to help, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead. Lines are drawn as love and loyalty are tested, even among the truest friends and family, in an increasingly divided wizarding world.  Fantastic Beasts and the Crimes of Grindelwald will be released in November 2018.",real

16495,"Associated Press  BOSTON (AP) — Longtime Boston television personality and entertainer Frank Avruch, who was the star of the popular children's TV program Bozo the Clown, has died. He was 89.  Avruch died Tuesday at his Boston home from heart disease, his family said in a statement to WCVB-TV .  Avruch played Bozo the Clown from 1959 to 1970, a clown character particularly popular in the U.S. in the 1960s because of widespread franchising in television. Avruch became the first nationally-syndicated Bozo the Clown.  ""He had a heart of gold,"" manager Stuart Hersh told The Associated Press on Wednesday, ""He brought the Bozo the Clown character to life better than anyone else's portrayal of Bozo the Clown.""  Avruch also was a contributor to WCVB-TV for more than 40 years as a host of Man About Town and The Great Entertainment.  Avruch passed away on Tuesday, March 20, 2018, of heart disease at his Boston home.  He was an active philanthropist and a board member of UNICEF'S New England chapter. He toured the world performing as Bozo the clown for UNICEF.  ""He touched so many people with his portrayal,"" Hersh said.  Avruch is survived by his wife Betty, two sons Matthew and Steven and several grandchildren.

Then destroy you without a second thought,” she captioned another snap, which appeared to show Pall, 32, kissing the mystery woman.  Image zoom Tori Woodward/Instagram  Reps for Pall and The Chainsmokers did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment about the incident, but Woodward — who has dated Pall since February 2014 — claimed this wasn’t the first time he had been unfaithful throughout their long relationship.  “After hours of begging him for scraps of honesty, I chipped away just enough to confirm that this is not the first time he’s remorsely [sic] cheated on me,” she wrote in another post, listing some of the other women she had questioned him about. “That ‘psycho bitch’ from Vegas, the ‘lame Instagram model’ caught on video and countless others he looked me in the eyes and swore on his life he never touched.”  According to Woodward, Pall allegedly gave her excuses for the infidelity but didn’t apologize.  “Consistent outright denial faded to him explaining that because all men do it, it’s not that bad. And in different words, that because he’s famous now, he had a different rulebook for decency,” she said. “What’s perhaps the most amazing is that he HASN’T EVEN APOLOGIZED.”  “What he has done is everything he possibly can to stop this from coming out, from looking [like] the kind of person who does what he’s done,” she claimed. ” ‘You’re better than this.’ That’s right I am, but you’re not.”  Image zoom Tori Woodward/Instagram  Image zoom Tori Woodward/Instagram  Woodward turned her heartbreak into empowerment by her message’s end, writing, “if there was ever a time to hold powerful men accountable for their disgusting behavior, it’s now.”  “Don’t be that guy.

She concluded her message by thanking her 40K followers for supporting her in her battle.  “I really appreciate all the kind messages I’ve been getting,” she wrote. “I’m moving on with my life now with the satisfaction that I’m liberated from a horrible person and encourage anyone else in a similar position to know your worth and do the same.”  RELATED VIDEO: Singer/Songwriter Emily Warren on How the Chainsmokers Handle Criticism: ‘It’s Hard [To Not] Get Beat Down by It’  The Chainsmokers, which is made up of Pall and Andrew Taggart, formed in 2012 and went on to find viral success with their 2014 tune “#Selfie.”  Their second EP, 2016’s Collage, brought them into the history books — its single, “Closer,” becoming the longest-running No. 1 hit in the United States in 2016.",real

While she and Justin Theroux split after two and a half years of marriage and seven years together, the couple seems to have done a pretty good job at avoiding each other at Hollywood events. But, with Jen moving to the Big Apple this coming Fall, she and Justin may see each other at one point or another.  According to Radar Online, Aniston is packing her bags and moving to New York City this coming October to film her upcoming, unnamed TV show for Apple alongside Reese Witherspoon. An insider close to Jen shares that since the actress has lived in New York two times before, she should be able to avoid awkward run-ins with Justin, but then again, you just never know.  Filming is expected to begin on October 1 and will continue through the end of the year. And while it may possibly put her slightly out of her comfort zone to be living so close to her ex, the source says that there’s no way that Jen will back out now.  “She’s actually been involved in the project for almost two years behind the scenes – before her divorce. Back then she was thinking it would bring her closer to Justin, but now it’s taken on a whole new turn by placing her in Justin’s stomping ground.”  Jennifer Aniston, Justin Theroux NOT Getting Back Together, Despite Claim Romance Isn't ""Over"" https://t.co/XjITkHBtrE pic.twitter.com/qpfeVnWWOP — Gossip Cop (@GossipCop) August 11, 2018  Jen’s upcoming role is said to possibly put her back on the map like her role of Rachel Green did on Friends.  “The positive is Jen is the star of this show and will get top billing over Reese, who plans to commute from L.A.,” the source dished. “This is really going to be a Jen-heavy series about a morning TV show and is going to need her working every day on it.”  Jennifer is currently over in Italy, filming her upcoming Netflix movie Murder Mystery, alongside Adam Sandler.

1662,"DEMI MOORE SAYS SHE SAVED her from some major business mistakes. Rosanna Arquette says she helped save her daughter’s life. Brad Pitt likes to drop by and play with her 5-year-old son Samson; wellness guru Deepak Chopra calls for advice. And Laura Day, the object of all this celebrity attention? “I’m not what you expect,” she insists. “I’m just your basic, straitlaced Jewish woman.”  Who believes—as do her fans—that she has a highly accurate sense of intuition. “Intuition allows us to predict events,” claims Day, 38. She maintains that everyone has such abilities,, waiting to be developed; her 1996 how-to book, Practical Intuition, sold 133,000 hardcover copies, and her 1997 follow-up, Practical Intuition for Success, is the first part of a two-book, $3 million deal. Before becoming an author, Day earned as much as $5,000 a session advising filmmakers (on script and casting problems) and business executives (about market trends). “I don’t see hallucinations, it’s just a flash of something in my head,” says Day, who’s wary of being thought of as some spacey psychic or guru. “I’m not magical or New Age or a spiritual leader. There’s nothing that sets me apart from anyone else.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  So how to explain all those A-list amigos? “She’s very open and loving,” says Arquette, who met Day through a mutual friend, rocker Peter Gabriel. In 1996, Arquette phoned Day to tell her that her daughter Zoe, then 2, had a fever and diarrhea, which a doctor had said was the flu. “I had a very clear feeling that Zoe was going to die,” recalls Day, who saw to it that the girl was taken to a hospital, where she was diagnosed with a rare form of blood poisoning. “Laura’s information saved Zoe’s life,” says Arquette. “It was intense.”  Day’s friendships with Hollywood heavyweights have helped her, too. When HarperCollins didn’t throw a bash for her second book last October, her friends, including close pal Brad Pitt, threw her a party instead. Demi Moore—or “Aunt Demi,” as she’s known to Samson—worked with Day on the set of 199l’s The Butcher’s Wife, in which Moore played a psychic. “Laura has given me a trust in my own intuition,” says the actress, who won’t reveal much about the business situation gone wrong but admits it would have been worse without Day’s intervention. “I took a greater position of responsibility,” says Moore. “Laura put me back in the driver’s seat.”  Day says she discovered her special way of seeing things at an early age. The oldest of four children born in New York City to David Globus, now 67 and an internist, and Vivian, a full-time mother, Day was 11 when her mother, who suffered from depression, slipped into a coma after a suicide attempt. “I wanted her to live,” says Day, “and I needed to know what to do.” She recalls having an instinct to channel her own warmth and energy into Vivian’s body. Her mother pulled through but, three years later, succeeded in taking her own life.  Day went on to study philosophy and religion at Syracuse University and, in 1979, at age 20, married Lee Day, now 39 and a Web site designer. Twelve years later they separated, and eight months after that, Day gave birth to their son Samson. Facing a mound of bills from a divorce that is still being litigated, Day, who had been teaching intuition workshops and taking a few consulting jobs, wondered how she could make ends meet and still be a full-time mother. “At the point when you’re most lost,” says Day, “that’s when intuition kicks in.”  Intuition said: Write a book. Her ensuing success—she writes two hours a day and is now working on Intuition and Love, a guide to finding a mate—allows her to “do bake sales and book sales and be a very involved parent.” A perfect evening is cooking for a gaggle of friends in her New York City loft, which she and Samson share with a cat, three lizards, a mouse and nine fish. “People are drawn to Laura,” says Adam Robinson, 42, an educator and Day’s boyfriend of three years. “She makes them feel at ease and accepted. She radiates empathy.”  And yet, Day only rarely gets intuitive about her own life, despite the success that trusting her gut has brought her. “I don’t want my environment perfect,” she says. “I work very hard to live in the moment. I’m interested in how I’m feeling right now.”",fake

426,"Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, made international headlines this year as their fairytale wedding was broadcast around the world. But one thing we still don’t know for certain is what the royal couple’s combined net worth is now that they’ve tied the knot.  The 36-year-old former Suits actress met Prince Harry back in 2016 after being set up on a blind date by a mutual friend. After dating for 15 months, Harry, who is sixth in line for the throne, popped the question during a quiet night in at Nottingham Cottage, the royal residence he calls home on the grounds of Kensington Palace. Six months later, the world-famous couple got married on May 19 at Windsor Castle. Meghan and Harry live together at Nottingham Cottage, though according to Architectural Digest, “Nott Cott” is only their temporary digs. And while the newest royal couple is living at the cottage rent-free, being philanthropic, jet-setting newlyweds doesn’t come cheap.  Here’s everything we know Prince Harry and Meghan’s net worth, and how much money they have as a married couple:  What is Meghan Markle’s net worth?  Prince Harry’s net worth far exceeds his wife’s, but Meghan made a good living as an actress.  She was reportedly paid $50,000 per episode on the USA Network legal drama Suits, raking in a salary of about $450,000 per year, according to Fortune, with some additional income from film roles.  While’s Meghan’s net worth was relatively easy to estimate before she married Harry, her finances are more complicated now that she’s married to her prince.  “She will continue to pay U.S. income tax on her income even after marrying Prince Harry, as the U.S. is one of two countries that taxes expats,” said Marlene Koenig, a royal expert. “She cannot start the process of becoming a U.K. citizen until she is married three years, and when she has acquired British citizenship, she will need to make a decision on whether or not she renounces her U.S. citizenship.”  Royal spouses are often encouraged to pursue philanthropy full-time, meaning Meghan will most likely not have any personal income to report in the future, especially since she already gave up her acting career to relocate for Harry.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle leave St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle after their wedding. Jane Barlow - PA Images/Getty Images  What is Prince Harry’s net worth?  Prince Harry — whose official title is now His Royal Highness Duke of Sussex — is royally rich, though his net worth is hard to nail down because some of his family’s fortune is kept private from the public.  While there are a lot of guesses out there about the 33-year-old prince’s wealth, global wealth insights firm Wealth-X estimates Prince Harry’s 2018 net worth is about $25 million — at the very least. Other reports speculate his net worth is as high as $40 million, but $25 million is the conservative estimate, Wealth-X told MONEY.  Both Prince Harry’s private income and the money he receives to take care of official royal obligations come from the same place — The Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate that funds the public, private and charitable activities of the Prince of Wales — Prince Charles, Prince Harry’s father — and his family. The estate has served the financial needs of the royal family since 1337, according to the estate’s website.  In 2017, all official expenses incurred by Prince Harry, his brother Prince William and his sister-in-law Kate Middleton — including official state visits, royal staffing and wardrobe costs — cost around $4.9 million, and were paid for by The Duchy of Cornwall, according to official documents.  Harry has even more in the bank when you look at his inheritance. Both William and Harry inherited half of their late mother Princess Diana’s estate — which is estimated to be worth about £20 million, or about $28 million — and the money was given to them when they each turned 30. “It has been suggested that William and Harry each received about £10 million ($14 million) from their mother’s estate, with Harry getting more because the money was invested longer for him,” Koenig said.  The inheritance also included Princess Diana’s personal jewelry collection, though it is unclear how much the jewels are worth.  In addition to Prince Harry’s wealth from his inheritance from his mother’s estate and his pay for royal obligations, he also earned a steady paycheck while serving 10 years in the British Royal Air Force — where he rose to the rank of captain before retiring. While he was working for the military, he made about $50,000, according to Forbes.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle leave St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle after their wedding. Jane Barlow - PA Images/Getty Images  Will Meghan inherit Prince Harry’s fortune now that they are married?  While Meghan and Prince Harry were legally married in May, the royal pair will likely wait to combine their finances, Koenig said.  If Markle and Harry open a joint bank account, their financial information could be open to scrutiny by U.S. regulatory bodies because Meghan is a U.S. citizen, according to Ryan Ellis, former tax policy director at Americans for Tax Reform. For that reason, the couple will probably keep their finances separate unless Meghan decides to gives up her U.S. citizenship.  Now that they’ve tied the knot, Queen Elizabeth — whose net worth is estimated to be around $490 million — has anointed Meghan and Prince Harry as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, just as Prince William and Kate Middleton became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Koenig said.  Meghan initially received the official title of Henry of Wales — it is common to literally take the prince’s name and title. But now that Harry is a duke, Meghan’s title is Her Royal Highness Duchess of Sussex. Meghan will also take on any other titles the Queen bestows upon Harry. But because neither Meghan nor Kate Middleton come from royal blood, they will never officially be called “princess,” according to CNN.  What were the details of Meghan and Prince Harry’s wedding?  The newest royal romance became official this spring when Meghan and Prince Harry tied the knot at Windsor Castle, just outside of London, on Saturday, May 19.  While we don’t know the exact cost of their wedding, it is estimated to be around the same as Prince William and Kate Middleton’s April 2011 nuptials. Luckily for them, the newlyweds did not foot the bill. Instead, their wedding was paid for by the royal family. The chapel they got married in, St. George’s, is smaller than Westminster Abbey where Will and Kate got hitched, holding only about 800 guests compared to Westminster’s 2,000.  Aimee Dunne, a London-based wedding planner, told CNN Money that she expected Meghan and Harry’s actual wedding — excluding security costs — to total nearly $1 million. But security is where the real costs add up: Prince William and Kate Middleton’s entire wedding reportedly cost $34 million with security alone totaling $32 million. The security costs for Harry and Meghan’s celebration ere unclear since it wasn’t an official occasion like the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding.",fake

Unclear future: While Carly and Evan's wedding will air on ABC during a special Bachelor broadcast, the fate of Bachelor In Paradise is up in the air following the emergency cancellation of season four  The scandal stems from a hookup between contestants Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson.  After the duo learned they would be paired together for a storyline on the partially-planned reality series, Corinne and DeMario embarked on a night of heavy drinking and hooking up which ended with Jackson publicly performing oral sex on his fellow contestant.  Although there were multiple witnesses to the drunken tryst on the first day of filming, a complaint was only filed after a producer raised serious concerns about Corinne's ability to consent after reviewing the footage from the previous day. Production was halted shortly thereafter.",real

As Kylie Jenner‘s due date approaches, her baby daddy Travis Scott, 25, is still pretty much absent from her life. Unlike her ex Tyga, 28, who was always there catering to the reality star’s every whim. Now she wondering if she picked the wrong guy to have a baby with. “Kylie is dealing with major regrets over her pregnancy as her due date quickly approaches. She is second guessing the biggest decision in her life, having a baby with Travis. As her relationship with her baby daddy is so rocky and uncertain, Kylie is starting to think he she made the wrong decision by deciding to have a baby with someone who is no longer present much in her life,” a source close to the cosmetics queen tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  “She has been having trouble sleeping late at night, worrying about her decisions. Kylie can’t help but wonder how things would be different if her baby was Tyga’s. She misses her ex Tyga, who was always caring and present, and she is beginning to think it should have been Tyga’s baby, not Travis'” our insider continues.  The 20-year-old’s nearly three year relationship with Tyga had just ended for good a month before she started dating Travis back in April of 2017. She got pregnant after they were together for only a few months, which isn’t exactly a solid foundation. At two months most couples haven’t even said their “I love you’s” yet, let alone find out they’re becoming parents together. With Tyga, she knew she had a guy who loved her deeply and was always there for her, even if they did fight a lot. Plus he showed that he’s already a great dad with his son King Cairo, 4. Who knows if Travis will make a wonderful father or not, but so far he hasn’t exactly been the most supportive partner to someone he’s going to share a child with.  HollywoodLifers, do you think Tyga would have made a better baby daddy for Kylie? Or do you think Travis will come through as a decent parent?",fake

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  An assistant state’s attorney told the Palm Beach Post that de Lesseps slammed a door and kicked at least one police officer. She also reportedly told people, “I’m going to kill you all,” before her arrest.  “This was my first time in Palm Beach since my wedding, and being here brought up long-buried emotions,” de Lesseps told PEOPLE in a statement. “I want to offer my sincere apologies to anyone I might have offended with my behavior. I am committed to a transformative and hopeful 2018.”  The reality star was released on her own recognizance Sunday, according to the Palm Beach Post, and Judge Ted Booras said she would be allowed to return to her home state of New York. However, he warned her not to ignore the charges against her. “I don’t think it would be that hard to find you,” he said.  She is due back in court on Jan. 25, 2018.  The office of the State Attorney for the 15th Judicial Circuit did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.

It’s been a tumultuous year for de Lesseps.  After nearly eight months of marriage, de Lesseps announced in early August that she and Tom D’Agostino were divorcing. They wed in a lavish, three-day wedding in Palm Beach last year over New Year’s weekend.  A source close to the Housewives previously told PEOPLE that de Lesseps had “hesitations” and “reservations” before their nuptials — “she had confided in friends that she knew something was up and that it didn’t gel — but she had to put on a good face to avoid embarrassment.”  Image zoom Charles Sykes/Bravo/NBCU/Getty  One cause of well-documented friction between Tom and his bride? The former lifelong bachelor’s previous alleged infidelity and flirtatious personality created “a lot of trust issues” for the reality star, who was married to Count Alexandre de Lesseps from 1993 to 2009 and gave up her Countess title when she wed D’Agostino.  D’Agostino broke his silence on the divorce in September, telling E!

2889,"Even though the tabloids might have you believe otherwise, Jennifer Aniston has gone on to do incredible things in the decade or so since she divorced Brad Pitt. She’s done a commendable share of philanthropic work (although she doesn’t advertise it) for St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, among other causes. She’s reached impressive new heights as a dramatic actress, with a performance in last year’s Cake so heartbreaking that many believed it deserved Oscar recognition. And she wrote a powerful essay this summer, trying to redirect the endless tabloid attention on her to more important issues in the world.  Nevertheless, when Pitt confirmed that he and Angelina Jolie were divorcing earlier this month, Aniston found herself swept back up into the magazine headline melee. Despite the suddenly aggressive tabloid and paparazzi attention since news of a celebrity breakup that has nothing to do with her, it seems as though Aniston has gone about her business as usual—joining husband Justin Theroux in New York this week for the premiere of his latest film, The Girl on the Train. And while there, Theroux was tossed a question about the Brangelina breakup and Aniston’s new involvement in the headlines. Rather than refuse to answer the question, as is certainly his red-carpet right, the Leftovers actor took the decidedly classy route in responding.  “As a child of divorce all I can say is that’s terrible news for those children and that's all you can really say,” Theroux told the Business Insider, referring to Pitt and Jolie’s six children. “It’s boring to sort of comment on anything else. People are having a bad time, that's horrible.”  Theroux also commented on the fact that Aniston has been dragged back into Pitt-Jolie headlines of late, calling the new tabloid narratives “nonsense.”  “There’s an endless appetite for trash, apparently, though everyone would say that they don’t have that appetite,” Theroux continued. “But I think a lot of people do because people buy it. But there are bigger things to bitch about. It’s shocking how much bandwidth things can take up when there are far more important things going on in the world.”  This past summer, Aniston herself became so fed up with a different variation of the nonsense tabloid headlines—at that time, related to whether or not she was pregnant—that she took it upon herself to write an essay on Huffington Post.  “Let me start by saying that addressing gossip is something I have never done,” Aniston wrote. “I don’t like to give energy to the business of lies, but I wanted to participate in a larger conversation that has already begun and needs to continue . . . For the record, I am not pregnant. What I am is fed up. I’m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body shaming that occurs daily under the guise of “journalism,’ the ‘First Amendment,’ and ‘celebrity news.’”",fake
1617,"(WENN) -- Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner have reportedly agreed on a settlement in their divorce.    According to editors at TMZ, the estranged couple has been locked in a complicated and time-consuming battle over their property, which has prevented their divorce from becoming final.  Ben and Jennifer did not have a pre-nuptial agreement in place, so all their earnings during their marriage had to split equally.  The superstar couple, who split in 2015 after 10 years of marriage, share three children - Violet, 12, Seraphina, nine, and Samuel, six.  Sources told the gossip site that the final settlement will be filed with the court once Gone Girl star has finished his stay in rehab.    The 46-year-old actress showed up at Ben's Pacific Palisades home in California on Wednesday afternoon and allegedly begged him to get help for his ongoing alcohol abuse issues. She told waiting photographers to give the couple privacy, and said ""it was not a good time"".  Jennifer was then spotted leaving with the actor/director and a person believed to be a sober coach and drove Ben to an unnamed rehab facility.  Friends of the star tell Page Six Ben has been ""struggling"" with sobriety since breaking up with girlfriend Lindsay Shookus, and it was photographs obtained by The Blast showing him taking a delivery of alcohol that reportedly forced his ex to take action.  In recent days, the Justice League star has been linked to 22-year-old Playboy playmate Shauna Sexton.  Despite the fact they split in 2015, Jennifer and Ben have remained close, but the double Oscar winner was noticeably absent from his estranged wife's Hollywood Walk of Fame star unveiling ceremony on Monday.

Charles Kushner was jailed from 2005 to 2006.  The young Kushner even carried a wallet that his father made for him while serving prison time for his white collar crimes.  Since the experience, Kushner has vowed to make prison reform a key issue as a senior White House adviser, according to Vanity Fair. He's lobbied for the First Step Act, a bipartisan bill that helps inmates transition back into society more smoothly with job training and drug treatment programs. The bill, which passed the House last week, also gives inmates with nonviolent charges the chance to finish their sentences in halfway houses and house arrest. It's also seen its fair share of criticism.  Kardashian has been scrutinized for defending her husband Kanye West after his controversial tweets supporting Trump and far-right figures. But prison reform is something that she's been vocal about in the past; on Monday, she tweeted her support for Matthew Charles, a former inmate who turned his life around after 21 years of incarceration. Charles is required to serve another 10 years because his original release was a clerical error.  This man is sentenced to 35 yrs for selling drugs. He serves over 21 yrs, is released, finds a job, new relationship, starts a new life, & now is being sent back for another 10 yrs because the original release was an error.

In an unaired clip from Khloe and Lamar, she pondered running for mayor of Glendale, a town in the greater Los Angeles area, because of its prominent Armenian population. (It's worth noting that Glendale doesn't have mayoral elections — instead, its city council appoints a member to serve as mayor for one year.) Despite her past misinformation about the town's bureaucratic structure, it's possible that she used this meeting to sow seeds for future political gain.  Kardashian hasn't made a public statement about the meeting yet, aside from tweeting the birthday message for Alice Marie Johnson. Is there a chance we'll get to see a behind the scenes of the meeting on the next season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians? Possibly — although season 15 doesn't have a premiere date yet.

I think when it's funny, it's funny,"" but added, ""Sometimes it goes from funny to mean.""  Spicer, who was famously impersonated on SNL by Melissa McCarthy throughout his time as press secretary, noted, ""I think that there were parts of it that were funny, but there's a lot of it that was over the line. It wasn't funny. It was stupid, or silly, or malicious."" He added, ""But there were some skits on late-night television that I did crack up at. ... You have to have a little bit of a thick skin if you're going to do this.""  When asked about his sudden resignation announcement, Spicer explained that though Trump didn't want him to leave, the two eventually came to an agreement on what would be best for the administration.  ""He's been very gracious throughout this process. He wanted to bring some new folks in to help rev up the communications operation,"" Spicer said of Trump, who hired new White House communications director and New York financier Anthony Scaramucci. As his first act on the job, Scaramucci announced that Sarah Huckabee Sanders — who had, up until now, acted as Spicer's deputy and filled in for him in recent weeks as he worked more behind the scenes — would be the new press secretary.  ""After reflection, my decision was to recommend to the president that I give Anthony [Scaramucci] and Sarah [Huckabee Sanders] a clean slate to start from so that they can talk about the president's agenda and help move it forward,"" Spicer continued.

He explained that he wanted to give Scaramucci and Sanders ""the opportunity to operate without me in the way. ... I just thought it was in the best interest of our press organization to not have too many cooks in the kitchen.""

""I think most people aren't really privy to how stories are developed and what stories make it to the front page or to mainstream media. ...

He noted that reporters now have a ""click-bait mentality.""  ""By and large, we're seeing more and more where it's about the clip or the click,"" he added.

It wouldn’t surprise me at all if she was one of those “I’ve been on a diet since I was 16” people. But just how extreme is her diet? I don’t know. When you think of it, she never really did bandwagon on any popular Hollywood diet, at least publicly. Maybe that’s because this whole time, she was just eating very, very small portions, at least according to Star:  Nicole Kidman insists on being served only 50% of her food when she’s out to dinner. “No matter what she orders, she asks the waiter to bring only her half of it,” tattles a tipster. “It could be a cup of soup – she’ll still ask to have it cut down. She thinks restaurant portions are way too big, so this helps her avoid overeating.” But don’t expect Nicole to ask for a doggie bag for the rest! “People have asked why she doesn’t just get the whole meal and leave half of it, but she insists that would be wasteful.”  [From Star Magazine, print edition]  You know what’s also wasteful? Paying full-price for a meal and only asking for them to send out half of it. That’s a waste of money. I’m sure that’s my peasant middle-classness speaking, but when I do go out to eat, I either finish my meal or take home what I can’t finish. Why not do that? I understand if Nicole thinks portions are too big – I disagree, more on that in a moment – but surely the answer is just… paying for and receiving your whole meal and then taking half home for later? Leftovers are good. And you’re paying for them anyway!  As for this whole “portions are too big these days” argument – it depends where you’re eating. If you’re going to some middle-America chain restaurant, for sure, I could see why you might think the portions are too big. But Nicole spends a lot of time in, like, LA and London. Do you really think those restaurants are bringing out a giant plate of hot wings and a vat of mashed potatoes?

I hate talking about stuff like this”), began tearing up as soon as the cameras started rolling, giving a particularly unfiltered perspective on gun control and the government’s continuing inaction in the face of mass shootings.  “It’s the kind of thing that makes you want to throw up or give up,” he said. “It’s too much to process.” He offered a scathing indictment of both the president, who offered his “warmest condolences” on Twitter while having signed a bill in February that allowed mentally ill individuals easier access to purchasing guns, as well as of the 56 senators who voted against closing a loophole that allows prospective gun buyers to evade the government-mandated background checks, showing their faces on screen and describing them as those “who won’t do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip.” For in the wake of various incidents of gun violence—Sandy Hook, Charleston, Orlando, now Las Vegas—the National Rifle Association has successfully lobbied in favor of second-amendment rights: “Our forefathers wanted us to have AK-47s, is the argument,” Kimmel said, incredulous.  Politicians’ inaction—and their widespread reluctance to turn mass shootings into mobilizing efforts in favor of stricter gun control—was the subject of the monologues of Kimmel’s peers, too. As Corden, whose voice also tightened as he delivered a quiet, measured speech, said, “Some say it’s too early to talk about gun control; for those victims last night, it’s far too late.” He, like Noah, is a recent New York transplant who has witnessed the two worst mass shootings since the mid-20th century in the past two years: First, at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida last summer; and now, in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Related Videos  “It should be hard for everyone to fathom,” Corden said. “Gun violence should not be a staple of American life.”  And yet the response to these shootings—of which there have been 275 so far in 2017—has become rote. “People are becoming more accustomed to this kind of news. I almost know how it’s going to play out,” Noah said during The Daily Show on Monday night, a sentiment Meyers echoed opening Late Night With Seth Meyers. “We’re shocked, we’re sad, thoughts and prayers, and then, almost on cue, people are going to come out and say, whatever you do, when you speak about the shooting, don’t talk about guns,” Meyers said.  It’s not just that politicians have refused to pass gun control legislation that, as Stephen Colbert pointed out, “the vast majority of Americans want.” Later this week, a bill that would make it easier for individuals to purchase gun silencers—which, as Politico reported, currently have more stringent requirements for purchase than guns themselves—was expected to go up for a vote in the House of Representatives. However, Sunday night’s shooting is expected to delay the bill to some degree—for, at least, if elected leaders refuse to “politicize” an incident of gun violence as a way of promoting gun control, the converse is also true, that they will also be reluctant to promote gun (and gun accessory) access. As Noah said, “Don’t talk about guns.”  Colbert closed out The Late Show’s introductory monologue with a firm address directly to Trump: “Doing nothing is cowardice.” he said. “You want to make America great again? Do something the past two presidents haven’t been able to do: Pass any kind of common-sense gun control legislation.”  Former 'Daily Show' correspondents Samantha Bee and Jason Jones on falling in love:",real

A reeling Johnny Depp is begging ex-wife Vanessa Paradis to get back together, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.  “Johnny now realizes that what he had with Vanessa was one of a kind,” an insider admitted of the 54-year-old, who finalized his disastrous divorce from Amber Heard, 31, in January. “She’s about the only person who can keep him in check, and the only person he really listens to.”  “Vanessa has been there for Johnny throughout this entire thing. She’ll always stand by him,” echoed Heather Rassel, who was married to Depp’s nephew Billy Rassel and remains close to the family.  As Radar reported, Depp ended his 14-year relationship to the mother of his children in 2012. He soon stepped out with Heard, and the two wed in 2015 — but the marriage ended one year later amid the actress’ domestic abuse claims and substance abuse allegations.  “I’m rooting for them to get back together,” Rassel added. “We all are. It would be great from the kids’ perspective.”  Unfortunately for Depp, sources revealed that the mother of Lily-Rose, 18, and Jack, 15 has moved on with French writer Samuel Benchetrit.

3159,"Miley Cyrus was spotted—totally pants-less—in Savana, Georgia on a coffee run with fiancé (or husband, as many suspect), Liam Hemsworth. The rumor mill has recently been claiming that the pair secretly wed in a private ceremony nearly seven months ago and simply never made an announcement to the public.  For the morning coffee date (where they were met by Miley’s mom, Trish), Miley chose an oversized pullover that made her look totally pants-less. Though it’s unclear whether she was sporting some shorts underneath, they would have to be pretty micro-mini, as there was no hint of anything peeking out of the bottom of her already short tunic top. She kicked her look up a notch with classic black Dr. Martens (which you can buy here).  Both the 24-year-old singer and her 27-year-old beau are still sporting rings on THAT finger, further leading to speculation that the pair have secretly said their vows. For such a photographed couple, however, we kind of love the prospect that they call each other husband and wife and the public is none the wiser.

The new images, taken by British photographer Matt Holyoak, show the two-month-old son of Prince William and Kate Middleton with his parents and other members of the royal family.  The photos were taken at a small reception following Louis' christening. They show the Windsors posing with the little prince in a series of adorable portraits.  In one of the most stunning shots, the Cambridges pose with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for the photos, along with William and Harry's dad, Prince Charles, and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.

They did not appear in the official portraits.  Louis' famous great-grandparents, the Queen and Prince Philip, were missing in action from the ceremony. The decision was not made on health grounds. The Duke of Edinburgh stayed behind in Norfolk while Her Majesty traveled to London yesterday.  Prince Louis, who was born on April 23, was christened at the Chapel Royal in St. James' Palace in London. The ceremony was private, but some familiar faces were seen arriving for the occasion, including Meghan Markle, Prince Harry, Prince Charles, Duchess Camilla, Pippa Middleton, and her husband James Matthews.  After the ceremony, the guests gathered at Clarence House (Charles and Camilla's residence) for afternoon tea hosted by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The couple served slices from a tier of their wedding cake (yes, from 2011) at the celebration.  The christening marked the first time all five Cambridges were photographed together, and now, they have official portraits to commemorate the occasion.  This post has been updated.

Looks like Katie Holmes, 39, and Jamie Foxx, 50, may be more serious than fans previously thought! While the couple had kept their relationship hidden for years, the two stepped out as a duo just last year. Since then, they’ve been spotted out and about together in public on multiple occasions — including making a big splash sitting side-by-side at Clive Davis’ pre-Grammy gala in NYC on Jan. 27. From the photos, Katie and Jamie looked happier than ever, and a new report claims that could be because they’re FINALLY on the same page about wanting to start a family together! Click here to see adorable pics of Katie Holmes with her daughter Suri Cruise.  Although it reportedly took some time for Katie to be on board, she apparently feels ready to have a baby with her new man — at least according to Life & Style magazine. “Jamie and Katie have been talking at great length about having a child together,” a source for the magazine recently told the publication. “He’s crazy about her and thinks they’ll have an adorable baby.” In fact, some witnesses at the gala last month allegedly think Katie could actually already be expecting. “At 39, Katie can feel her biological clock ticking,” the source explained. “She’s been telling friends that she doesn’t have time to waste!”  Katie is already the proud mom to 11-year-old Suri Cruise, whom she shares with ex-husband Tom Cruise, 55, and Jamie too has daughters: Corinne, 23, and Anelise, 9. But now that the two are getting more serious, they’re reportedly ready to have a baby of their own. “He told her they would make beautiful children together, and she never disagreed,” the insider said. “She’s seen what an amazing dad he is.”  On top of Jamie’s parenting skills though, he reportedly treats Katie like a “princess.” And now that Suri is getting older, Katie has apparently been “telling close friends that Suri is grown up that she really misses having a baby around the house.” Who knows, maybe there’ll be another little one running around in no time!

4012,"TO MOVIEGOERS, Meg Ryan conjures up images of hearts, flowers and a perpetually pretty pout.  But to her mother, Susan Jordan, Meg is something less than the cute-as-a-button queen of romantic comedies.  In fact, she says, America’s sweetheart is a down and dirty liar.  “I began reading all these falsehoods and lies about me in the press after she met Dennis Quaid,” the 60-year-old former schoolteacher said from her summer house in North Carolina.  “These were lies constructed by my daughter in order to enhance her image – and certainly to protect Dennis Quaid.”  Jordan’s shot at Ryan is the latest volley in the mother of all battles between her and her daughter.  But, with the Ryan-Quaid marriage in tatters, and with Meg drifting off to find true love with “Gladiator” hunk Russell Crowe, Jordan hopes the rift with her daughter may soon be a thing of the past, too.  The two have not spoken for a decade. Jordan maintains the break was sparked by a 1990 confrontation over Quaid’s drug use.  Ryan, 38, implies that the problems with her mother go back much further – to the time, 23 years ago, when Susan walked out on her marriage. Ryan refused to comment for this story.  “Everyone knows Meg as this wonderful persona, the saving angel for poor Dennis,” Jordan says, her voice trembling.  “But I think it was a very handy thing for her to do, to present herself as a savior of this troubled soul who was a drug addict. How would it have looked if it came out that I had noticed this first? She had to discredit me to preserve her image.”  And, while Ryan may be estranged from Jordan, she is eerily following in her mother’s footsteps with a similar marriage breakup.  RYAN is about the same age as Jordan was when she left Meg’s father, Harry Hyra, driving away from Bethel, Conn., in her old Ford Pinto in search of a career 50 miles away in Manhattan.  “Trust me, I know what it’s like to be lonely in a marriage,” Jordan says now.  “I don’t know Russell Crowe from a hole in the wall, but I see them together in pictures and I can tell there is something there. I wish she finds the love she so desperately wants from him, and that she is finally happy.”  Quaid has reportedly threatened Ryan that he will do everything he can to keep their 8-year-old son, Jack. That leaves Ryan in much the same position her mother was when she and Hydra decided it was better for their three children to stay with their father until Jordan had the money to support them.  The children remained with Harry Hyra until the early 1980s, when Ryan went off to the University of Connecticut and the other children joined their mother, who was then teaching at a tony Connecticut prep school, Choate Rosemary Hall. Around that same time, Susan remarried, to journalist Pat Jordan, a man she calls the love of her life.  Ryan has said in interviews that her mother abandoned her kids to pursue an acting career in New York – something Jordan hotly denies.  Instead, she maintains, she worked as an assistant to a casting director for about a year while waiting for a job to open up at Choate Rosemary Hall.  “One of the main reasons I took that job was so I could meet all the agents and introduce them to Peggy,” she says, using the family nickname for Ryan, who was then in high school.  “I tried out once for a part in a TV commercial to help pay for basic expenses that my job couldn’t cover.”  After Ryan’s graduation, Jordan began taking Ryan to casting agents, introducing her as a young actress, and Ryan began to get roles in commercials.  In 1978, when she received her Screen Actors Guild membership card, she took her mother’s maiden name as her surname. In 1980, also through her mother’s connections, Ryan won her first part in a feature film – “Rich and Famous,” starring Candice Bergen and Jacqueline Bisset.  For her part in Ryan’s rise to fame, Jordan says she got small thanks from her daughter.  “When I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1979, every member of my family came to see me in the hospital after my mastectomy except for Peggy,” Jordan says, her voice quivering.  “She wouldn’t take one day off from college to come see me. She didn’t even call. She said she just didn’t feel comfortable.”  BUT the real rift, Jordan maintains, came in 1990, when she first met Dennis Quaid.  “Meg asked me what I thought of him, and I asked her, ‘Do you want me to tell you what I think, or what you want to hear?’  “She said, ‘Oh, no, Mom. I want to know your honest opinion.’ I said, ‘Well, he strikes me as being childish, undisciplined – but maybe that’s just Hollywood.’  “I didn’t understand him, but I could see what Meg was attracted to. He has a certain boyishness and charm that is very sexy.”  What began as a mother’s disapproval turned into a mother’s worst nightmare when Jordan and her second husband, Pat, accepted an invitation from Ryan and Quaid to visit their home in Montana for Thanksgiving a little over a decade ago.  “I noticed some very strange behavior on the part of Dennis. He was jumpy, jittery, red faced, constantly rushing into the bathroom, coming back calm, getting up and rushing to the bathroom or outdoors again. I thought, God, what is wrong here?” she recalls.  Jordan claims Quaid’s behavior got even stranger during that visit. When she asked his advice about a trip to Florence, he became enraged.  “I spread some things on the kitchen countertop in an attempt to show Dennis, and he just shoved them off of the counter, snapping, ‘I don’t have time for this right now.’  “I was so shocked I just stood there with my mouth open. Pat rose up from his chair – I thought he was going to grab Dennis by the shirt, he was so angry. I kept saying, ‘No, no, it’s OK,’ to Pat, but I don’t even think Dennis noticed.  “I suspect he didn’t even know what he was doing. I just knew there was something terribly, terribly wrong with his behavior.”  THE final straw came during Thanksgiving dinner, a meal punctuated with frequent silences – and one final creepy moment.  “The Berlin Wall was just coming down, and Dennis made some crazy comment, and I remember piping up, ‘Dennis, that is just ridiculous!’ and he just stared at me with this incredibly jittery, almost wild look in his eyes.  “Pat stood up at the table and said, ‘Susan, come on, let’s go.’ Peggy looked terrified that I was leaving.  “I had no idea why until months later I thought she might have thought I knew about this [Quaid’s] drug problem. Did she think, what is it going to look like if America’s sweetheart is engaged to a drug addict?”  Upon returning to her home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Jordan says she worried about Quaid’s behavior for months before confronting Ryan.  “I called a dear friend who is a physician, who told me Dennis’ behavior sounded like cocaine addiction. I said, ‘Oh my God, can you get over it?'”  The final straw, Jordan says, was when she read a newspaper story report of Quaid attempting to kick a photographer at the premiere of “Joe Versus the Volcano,” causing Ryan to burst into tears.  “I called Peggy and asked, ‘Is it possible Quaid has a problem with cocaine?’ With that, she started to cry and said she didn’t want to talk about it. I left it at that. I was very worried, but how can you intrude on a grown child?”  Tension flared again on the eve of Ryan’s planned wedding to Quaid in 1990. Jordan had phoned her daughter, who later called her back.  “I have no idea to this day what prompted her to call me back that afternoon,” says Jordan. “She demanded to know why I thought Dennis was a drug addict. I said, ‘I never said I thought he was a drug addict, I asked you if he had a problem with cocaine.’  “Peggy said, ‘Who are you to even ask me that?’ I said, ‘I’m your mother! I have to ask you. I love you. I am concerned.’ She slammed the phone down.  “She called me back later that evening to tell me the wedding was off. I tried to say, ‘Oh my goodness,’ but she hung up on me. Those were the last words I heard from her.  “Then I began to read how I was the mother who had abandoned Peggy, that I was the woman who had left my marriage so I could pursue a coffee commercial. I never did say anything about Quaid’s drug addiction, but shortly after our argument he went into a drug rehab program.”  RYAN and Quaid married in 1991 – but Jordan wasn’t invited.  Although she tried to make contact with her daughter, Ryan refused her phone calls and eventually instructed her siblings and handlers not to reveal her address and phone number to her.  Jordan claims Quaid contacted her right before Jack was born.  “He told me I’d never be able to see my grandson,” she recalls sadly.  Over the years, Ryan and Jordan grew more estranged. A 1992 article in Special Reports magazine in which Pat Jordan wrote about the family feud only exacerbated their problems.  His vengeful expose, titled “The Meg Ryan Nobody Knows” portrayed the actress as a cold, spiteful child.  In it, he said: “Meg is an ungrateful, manipulative, envious daughter who wouldn’t take one day off school to look after her cancer-stricken mother.”  He also wrote about Dennis Quaid’s cocaine addiction. Ryan has told journalists she never read the piece.  Now, Jordan says she wants to set the record straight – and someday make amends with Ryan.  “If she called me now, I would tell her that I love her. It would give me peace to know that she is leading a happy life. She has always been a positive person – always the happiest and most generous child.  “This is why I have been so befuddled all these years and why our estrangement has been so painful.  “I can’t blame Dennis Quaid, but I think it’s strange it all started with him. Now, I hope it’s not to much to pray that this separation ends with him, as well.”",fake

With an eye on the future, and an already unflinching sense of duty, she made a commitment,” he told the delegates. “She said that whether her life be long or short, it would be dedicated to the service of the people of the Commonwealth.”  “From that speech in 1947 onwards, she has known that young people really make the difference,” Harry continued. “Her call to action was for her fellow young people to lead the way in making the Commonwealth a ‘more free, more prosperous, more happy and a more powerful influence for good in the world.'”  Can’t get enough of PEOPLE’s Royals coverage?

1840,"The tall, dark, and handsome gentleman was dining with friends at Chicago’s hip Girl & the Goat restaurant when Neil Patrick Harris, going incognito in a baseball cap, spontaneously stopped by his table…and made a curious proposition. “Neil went up to my friend and said, ‘Hey, you’re really sexy. Can I give you my number?’ and, ‘Come to my hotel later,’” a source exclusively tells In Touch of the alleged encounter, which happened during the actor’s trip to the Windy City for a Dec. 8 book signing. “My friend, who’s a fan of Neil’s, told him he’s straight and said, ‘I’m confused. Aren’t you married?’ Neil told him, ‘My marriage isn’t working out.’ ”  It wasn’t just a pickup line: In Touch has learned that Neil and husband David Burtka, who’ve been together since 2004, are facing a relationship crisis. “They’re on shaky ground,” an insider close to the actor, 44, and the chef, 42, tells In Touch. And while David always knew Neil is a big flirt, “lately, it’s been more of an issue,” adds the insider. “They love each other and their kids [seven-year-old twins Gideon and Harper], but they want their relationship and lives to be more harmonious. Right now, the marriage could go either way.”  (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  They’re fundamentally different people. “Neil is outgoing and loves to party and go out on a moment’s notice, while David often calls himself ‘Mr. Homebody,’” explains the insider, noting  that the Emmy-winning How I Met Your Mother alum can be high maintenance and moody. “That drains David. So that’s a constant source of conflict.” (A rep for Neil denies there is marriage trouble or that Neil hit on another man at Girl & the Goat.) They’ve been dealing with their problems for a long time.  A year ago, Neil, who wed David in 2014, revealed he was going to therapy twice a week, and in April, David told In Touch that they’ve long sought a professional’s help together. “It’s not easy being in a relationship. We go to couples therapy,” David said. “Not that there’s anything wrong, but it’s nice to sort of just talk to someone who is a mediator. That’s helped.” But lately, according to the insider, “because of Neil’s schedule, the therapy hasn’t been as consistent, but they’ve been going.”  They’re also struggled to adjust to David’s decision to stop drinking alcohol last year. “I didn’t like the way I was acting, I thought, ‘I owe it to myself. I owe it to my kids, to be there 100 percent,’” David said in April. But instead of helping strengthen the family, tension with Neil only increased, says the insider: “It always does when one partner gets sober and the other one doesn’t.”  Still, divorce is a step neither of them is willing to take lightly. “They’re constantly told how much their public marriage and kids have meant to the gay community, and both take that seriously and want to remain role models,” says the insider. “They’re both decent people who love each other and their kids and are trying to work it out.”  For more on this, pick up the latest issue of In Touch — and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter.",fake

The actress, who is also the face of Gemfields, has designed an 18-karat yellow-gold ring set with a Zambian emerald in Marina B’s signature cut, with all profits from the $4,800 (around £2,970) price tag donated to support the upgrade of the Gemfields Nkana Health Centre in Zambia.  “We are very excited about the new Mila ring, as it will introduce the iconic Marina B style to a new generation,” said Paul Lubetsky, the CEO of Marina B. “While we created it for Mila in celebration of Wyatt’s arrival, this is the kind of ring any woman can wear.”  “Having worked with Marina B on a previous collection of emerald jewellery, it was only natural that we would collaborate on a piece for our brand ambassador, Mila Kunis, as she starts her journey into motherhood,” continued Ian Harebottle, the CEO of Gemfields. “Not only is the ring beautiful, but it furthers our commitment to social responsibility.”  Kunis and her fiancé Ashton Kutcher welcomed their first child together, daughter Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher, on 30 September. They confirmed their engagement back in February.  The ‘Mila’ Motherhood ring is available to reserve at marinab.com/mila",real

893,"A Simple Favor type Movie genre Thriller  Like Blake Lively’s recently purged Instagram photos, the actress’ latest character has gone missing in the new trailer for Bridesmaids helmer Paul Feig’s upcoming mystery A Simple Favor.  “I do consider Emily my best friend. She’s this wonderful, elegant person,” Anna Kendrick (as Stephanie) says of Lively’s character in the preview, which the latter debuted Wednesday morning via her Twitter account. Crazy Rich Asians star Henry Golding, who plays Emily’s husband, Sean, continues: “She is an enigma, my wife. You can get close to her, but never quite reach her.”  As quick flashes of police sirens, a violent car crash, and deliciously smirky glances flash onscreen, Emily reminds us: “Everybody has a dark side. Some of us are better at hiding it than others.”  The biggest reveal the trailer presents, however, is Emily grinning in a crimson wig after Stephanie explains: “Five days ago, Emily went missing. I’m realizing I don’t know her as well as I thought I did. Emily, if you’re out there, we’re all really worried!”  In anticipation of the trailer’s release, Lively sent fans into a tizzy Monday by deleting all of her Instagram posts save for a single photo of a hangman-style game which spelled out the question, “What happened to Emily?” As of Wednesday, Lively unfollowed most of the accounts she previously tracked, and is now following only women named Emily Nelson — 37 of them, to be exact.  A Simple Favor — also starring Rupert Friend, Jean Smart, Linda Cardellini, Andrew Rannells, and Sarah Baker — is set for release on Sept. 14. Watch the film’s trailer above.",fake
15209,"""Seeing her name in headlines again and again, as part of one person’s attempt to gain more attention for her personal cause, along with Harvey’s desperate attempt to vindicate himself, was devastating for her,"" the family said.  Veteran studio executive and producer Jill Messick died by suicide on Wednesday after battling depression for many years, her family tells The Hollywood Reporter.  Messick, who worked at Miramax as a production executive from 1997 to 2003, also served as Rose McGowan's manager in January 1997, which is when, McGowan has claimed, she was raped by Harvey Weinstein.  In a statement following her death, her family says Messick was ""victimized"" after becoming embroiled in the Weinstein-McGowan allegations. Her name made headlines when Weinstein's attorney, Ben Brafman, released an email on Jan. 30 attributed to Messick in defense of his client. Her family says now that Messick ""became collateral damage in an already horrific story.""  Messick's family's full Feb. 8 statement is below.  ""The Movement"" just lost one of its own.  Jill Messick was a mother of two children, a loving wife and partner, a dear friend to many and a smart entertainment executive. She was also a survivor, privately battling depression, which had been her nemesis for years.  Today she did not survive. Jill took her own life.  Jill was victimized by our new culture of unlimited information sharing and a willingness to accept statement as fact. The speed of disseminating information has carried mistruths about Jill as a person, which she was unable and unwilling to challenge. She became collateral damage in an already horrific story.  Jill believed in the Movement. She supported every woman finally coming forward to share their dark truths and expose those who had committed previously unspeakable deeds. She was loyal. She was strong. Jill was many things, but she was not a liar.  Over the past few months, many women have come out with allegations against Harvey Weinstein, including Rose McGowan, who has repeatedly spoken with the press, striking out against not only her alleged attacker, but a great many others. One of them was Jill, who chose to remain silent in the face of Rose's slanderous statements against her for fear of undermining the many individuals who came forward in truth. She opted not to add to the feeding frenzy, allowing her name and her reputation to be sullied despite having done nothing wrong. She never chose to be a public figure; that choice was taken away from her.  Now that Jill can no longer speak for herself, it's time to set the record straight.  In January 1997, Jill was an entry-level manager at Addis Wechsler. One of her first clients was Rose McGowan, and one of Jill's first duties was to set up a breakfast meeting with Harvey Weinstein during the Sundance Film Festival. Following the meeting, Rose told Jill what had happened — that she made the decision to remove her clothes and get in the hot tub with him — a mistake which Rose immediately regretted. Rose never once used the word rape in that conversation. Despite this, Jill recognized that Harvey had done something untoward to Rose, if not illegal. She immediately went to her bosses, the partners of Addis Wechsler, to recount Rose's story and to insist that they immediately address the situation. They told Jill that they would handle the situation. The ensuing arrangements between Rose and Harvey were then negotiated, completely without Jill's knowledge. At that time, all Jill knew was that the matter was settled and that Rose continued making films with the Weinsteins. She never knew any details until recently, when Rose elected to make them public.  Ten months later, in November of 1997, Jill received a call from the Miramax exec VP of production, recruiting her for a job as an executive at Miramax Films working in production in Los Angeles. Jill was hired based on merit and her excellent work of over two years as a young development executive working with Woods Entertainment (prior to her time at Addis Wechsler).  Rose's most recent round of press to promote her book has included new stories involving Jill. The constant press attention Rose has garnered in print and on national TV led to Harvey Weinstein releasing two documents. One of these was an email that Jill wrote to him months prior to the first New York Times piece coming out, and at his request. In this email, Jill offered the truth based on what she remembers Rose telling her about the Sundance account. In the face of Rose's continued and embellished accusations last week, Harvey took it upon himself to release the email without her consent.  Five years ago, Jill suffered a manic episode. Anyone familiar with bipolar disorder knows that it is a cruel and vicious disease. With the help of doctors, her family and friends, Jill rebounded. Jill had fought to put her life back together. After a long job search, she was in negotiations to run the production division for a new entertainment company.  Seeing her name in headlines again and again, as part of one person's attempt to gain more attention for her personal cause, along with Harvey's desperate attempt to vindicate himself, was devastating for her. It broke Jill, who was just starting to get her life back on track. What makes Rose's inaccurate accusations and insinuations against Jill ironic was that she was the first person who stood up on Rose's behalf, and alerted her bosses to the horrific experience which Rose suffered. Twenty years ago, as a very junior person in a management company hierarchy, Jill exhibited her integrity in doing the right thing — she raised the red flag with the heads of her firm. In the face of inappropriate behavior, Jill handled the situation appropriately.  Hers is one of the only stories that has stayed consistent over time as we watch other media reported tales morph to beget further attention.  While journalists serve an important role in exposing predatory behavior, we are seeing irresponsible choices and an addiction to sensationalism which leads to inconsistent storytelling. The media is a powerful tool not to be taken lightly. Most individuals would be horrified to have their name spotlighted in a major international news story — let alone their photograph. We cannot forget that the media is a fearsome tool which cannot be used indiscriminately or even inadvertently to create further victims.  There is a responsibility when using a platform to accurately expose criminals, predators, mistruths and misdeeds while protecting the actual truth of third parties.  As we collectively seek to take action in an effort to right the wrongs so brazenly and inhumanely repeated for a generation, we must not forget one simple truth: Words have power. While we illuminate the dark corners for hidden truths, we must remember that what we say, particularly in the media, can have just as much impact if not more than our actions. We must ask more of ourselves, and of each other. We must take a moment to consider the ramifications and consequences of what we say and what we do.  Words matter.  Someone's life may depend on it.",real
1803,"1 of 5  2000: The Singing Debate  In an interview with Peter Travers, Clooney finally addressed something fans had been wondering for quite some time: Did he actually sing in O Brother, Where Art Thou? Since his aunt, the famed Rosemary Clooney, had such a stellar singing career, the producers assumed he, too, would have a solid set of pipes.    ""Then we got into the recording studio and I sang 'Man of Constant Sorrow' with all the music playing, and I finished and looked up and there's that glass booth with all of them in it and no one would look me in the eye,"" he told Travers.

296,"Actor Ryan Phillippe will not face criminal charges in the domestic violence case that resulted in a lawsuit being filed by a former girlfriend.  Frank Mateljan, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office, told USA TODAY that his office will not be pursuing the matter further.  ""The City Attorney's Office was referred this matter following an investigation by the LAPD,"" he said in a statement. ""After a thorough review, the matter was set for a City Attorney office hearing, during which both parties were present, detailed the incident, were advised on the law and given guidance as to how to avoid similar incidents in the future.  ""Separate hearings were held in August and September. No further action has been scheduled following our office hearing, though we do reserve the right to file charges up to one year after the incident.""  Ryan Phillippe lands in hospital with 'badly broken' leg  On Monday, model Elsie Hewitt, 21, sued the actor for $1 million, alleging assault, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Phillippe denies the accusations.  ""The claims are false,"" Phillippe's rep, Nicole Perna, said to USA TODAY in a statement.  Later in the evening, he expanded on his thoughts in a tweet confirmed by Perna.  ""I am saddened and disgusted by these false allegations being circulated about me,"" he wrote. ""At the time these allegations were initially made, I fully cooperated with law enforcement and a thorough investigation was conducted.""  He continued, ""As a man, raised by women, in a household where women's right's, feminism and advocacy were very much at the forefront, I am sickened that my name can be found in any article where domestic violence of any kind is being alleged.""  Hewitt's lawsuit, obtained by USA TODAY, says Phillippe, who is 22 years her senior, became increasingly possessive and violent towards her (often while under the influence) during their three-month relationship.  The document states that during their relationship, she observed Phillippe, 43, ""repeatedly abusing a panoply of legal and illegal drugs, including without limitation: cocaine, ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms and steroids.""  Things reached a boiling point over the July 4th holiday, according to the suit, when Hewitt and a friend came to his house to pick up personal items she would need for an upcoming modeling job.  Phillippe, she describes, was ""discernibly drunk and high"" at the time, and became increasingly ""agitated and hostile."" In an effort to diffuse the situation, Hewitt asked to speak with him privately upstairs.  When that plan failed, she called her friend to come upstairs while she cleared out her belongings from his bedroom.  At that point, the lawsuit says, Phillippe grabbed Hewitt by the arm (""so tightly that his grip left heavy bruises on her arm hours later"") and ""violently threw her down his staircase as hard as he could.""  She made a second trip up the stairs only to be cornered, kicked and thrown down the stairs again. As and her friend fled, he cursed and screamed ""get the (expletive) out of my house, you crazy (expletive)!""  Soon afterward, she sought treatment at the emergency room at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where police filed a report, noting ""visible injuries to (Hewitt's) legs, back, arms, shoulder and face"" and granted her a week-long emergency protective order, which was served at Phillippe's home on July 6.  The day beforehand, Hewitt says he texted her saying he was ""so sad"" and contacted her friends via private message on social media that he was ""heartbroken"" and ""in disbelief"" that police had come to his home.  ""I can't believe she'd do this to me,"" he allegedly wrote, adding he ""would never hurt her like she's claiming. I didn't hit or punch or kick her.""  The friend who witnessed the encounter replied, ""I saw the whole thing Ryan, you literally were grabbing her and threw her down the stairs.""  Hewitt is seeking $1 million in punitive damages, citing emotional distress and the impact physical attack had on her ability to work as a model since her ""income and career (are) largely contingent upon her physical features.""  Phillippe's publicist released a statement flatly denying the account.  In his tweet, Phillippe noted, ""I have been a public figure for almost 25 years and many untrue things have been said or written about me in the past. That is something you learn to accept if you choose a profession like mine. This time is different.""  He also took offense at the notion of using this type of accusation for personal gain: ""Domestic violence is a very real and tragic issue for many women the world over and should never be used to vengefully slander or as a ploy for monetary gain. This is wrong. This is not who I am. Every one of my accuser's allegations (is) false.""  Katy Perry dismisses idea she's dating Ryan Phillippe with quippy tweet  Phillippe was previously married to Reese Witherspoon, who filed separation papers in 2006 after seven years of marriage.

Calm down everyone, Perrie Edward‘s, 23, review of Selena Gomez‘s, 24, 13 Reasons Why isn’t nearly as harsh as it sounds. In fact, it’s SUPER NICE. Yes the Little Mix singer thought the Netflix series was “massively disturbing,” but she meant it in a positive, empowering way. And besides, aren’t the greatest works of art the ones that make us feel and think? “The way they got the message across was amazing, and although I found it massively disturbing, I feel like every person going to school should watch it.” See — Perrie totally loved it!  It’s a good thing too, since 13 Reasons Why is basically Selena’s baby. The “Hands To Myself” hitmaker took time away from her singing career to produce the series, which probably was a little frightening at least, but the results totally paid off. Fans love the show SO MUCH that they’re already asking about season 2, or if there’s even going to be one. “We don’t know what is going to go beyond it, but we know there are so many stories that lie beneath each character,” Selena explained to The Hollywood Reporter. “That’s why it became a series in the first place.

And now we know that it was Kylie Jenner who told Khloé Kardashian the shocking news.  In a new teaser clip for the next episode, Kendall, Kourtney, Kim, Kylie and Scott Disick react to the cheating allegations, with Kim telling producers, “there’s a video of Tristan making out with a girl last night.

1340,"Changing the writer and director for this third Iron Man movie turns out to be the best thing that could have happened, because Shane Black is a much more focussed filmmaker, and he gives this franchise a badly needed kick. We know that he and Downey work well together (see Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), but we could never have anticipated how Black would bring clarity to Downey's comical riffs. He also makes the action scenes much more human, and therefore a lot more thrilling.  The story takes place in the overall Marvel chronology. Wealthy arms manufacturer Tony Stark (Downey) is feeling badly shaken by his experience working with the Avengers to fight off an alien invasion. So he dives into his work and neglects his relationship with Pepper (Paltrow), who also runs his company. Then two faces from the past reappear: bio-scientist Maya (Hall) is an old colleague of Tony's, while technical genius Aldrich (Pearce) has a past with Pepper. And both seem somehow connected to a wave of nasty bombings that is terrorising America, masterminded by a menacing man who calls himself the Mandarin (Kingsley). And the Mandarin's next target is Tony.  Intriguingly, the script keeps Tony out of the Iron Man suit for much of the film's running time, which makes his character feel much more grounded than ever before. It also makes the action set pieces even more spectacular, since they're not mere robot-vs-robot animated battles. So even if the dialog is peppered with technical gibberish, at least it has a personal dimension. Which not only deepens Tony and Pepper as characters, but makes the surrounding people more interesting. These include Tony's old pal (Cheadle), two self-healing goons (Dale and Szostak) and a pre-teen (Simpkins) who helps Tony. And with his constantly surprising character, Kingsley very nearly steals the show.  Continue reading: Iron Man 3 Review",fake

That door is open in a way that it never has been and they really do know, ‘Oh this is so and so and this is his husband,’ and ‘this is so and so and this is her wife,’ and that has completely been normalized, at least for my kids and hopefully will be for this next generation.”",real

2242,"Despite rumors of a split, Rihanna is still very much together with boyfriend of one year Hassan Jameel. We’ve got the pics of their steamy Mexican getaway  Rihanna has kept her one year romance with Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel super private. So when rumors surfaced in June that they had broken up fans were waiting to see proof they were still a couple. They got it on July 9 when pics surfaced of the 30-year-old singer and the businessman on a sexy Mexican getaway. The two appeared to be locked in a animated conversation as bikini clad RiRi is seen pointing her right index finger in the air with her mouth open, looking like she had something important to say. In another pic Hassan is seen looking back at her with his hand on his chest as if they’re involved in a somewhat heated conversation. CLICK HERE to see all the pics.  On June 1 MediaTakeOut claimed RiRi had dumped Hassan. The site reported that “Rihanna just got tired of him. She gets tired of men sometimes,” an alleged insider told them. They said that the handsome billionaire wasn’t doing too well after the split. “Of course Rihanna broke his heart. That’s what she does — break men’s hearts.” Since Rihanna has never commented on her romance with Hassan and goes to great lengths to keep their relationship away from the public eye, MTO’s report spread like wildfire.  Obviously something is still on between Rihanna and Hassan, as they are having a hot summer together. They were first photographed a year ago making out in a pool in Spain. They’ve only been pictured a handful of times since, keeping their love undercover. The “Work” singer’s previous relationship was with Drake, 31, and it played out in public. He even professed his years of love to her in front of the world while presenting her with the Video Vanguard award at the 2016 VMAs. After having the public know all about their dating business, Ri has wisely kept her romance with Hassan as far out of the public eye as possible.  Rihanna revealed recently that Drake gushing about her on live TV made her cringe. In a May 2018 interview with Vogue, she said “Waiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don’t like too many compliments; I don’t like to be put on blast.” As for where she stands with Drizzy, she told the mag that they haven’t spoken and that “We don’t have a friendship now, but we’re not enemies either. It is what it is.” However she did come the close to discussing her relationship with Hassan, telling the publication that she dating and she is happy. “I used to feel guilty about taking personal time,” she revealed, “but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before,” she said about her romance with Hassan.",fake

12929,"“And there was something that crystallized about the whole script for me from that, because that's a metaphor for their whole relationship. They're in the eye of the hurricane,” she adds. “They've always got drama, and chaos, and war, and strife, but their relationship is what gives them that sort of bubble that they're in, of heaven. And it allows them to deal with all the crises in their life because they have that central beauty and calm together that makes them a team.”  The eye of the storm provided another hard-to-spot VFX moment, and Moore’s really hoping that you didn’t pick up on it.  “In the script, it was sunshine, because they're in the eye of the hurricane. And then as we got into post, we realized it didn't quite feel right that it was such a hard sun,” he says. “It felt more natural that there should still be some rain, it should be a little more overcast. The problem with that was there was no rain hitting the surface of the water. To put that into visual effects ... was going to be so much money and crazy 3-D modeling and not worth it. So we just added some rain over the top, and I was sweating about, ‘Everyone's going to see that there's no rain hitting that water.’”  Ultimately, Moore admits, he remembered a scene in The Hunt for Red October where the main character is being lowered from a helicopter onto a submarine in the middle of a storm, but the surface of the water is calm.  “When you throw this rain in front of the camera in post, and you pump up the wind sounds, and the soundtrack, you just want to believe it,” Moore says with a chuckle. “If you break it down and you really look at it, you go, ‘Wow, that is not a storm at all,’ but the audience just goes with you. They want to believe it's a storm. They're not looking for the flaws. We look for the flaws.”",real

""Whenever I'm not feeling well, I'll feel my scar to remind me to slow down,'' Menounos told Women's Health.  Maria Menounos says having a brain tumor removed has taught her to slow things down in her life.

At least three times!"" she said. ""Just a few months after we found my mom's brain cancer, I started having similar symptoms: blurred vision, light-headedness, headaches.

14412,"The cast of Vanderpump Rules is said to be divided behind-the-scenes.  Ahead of next week’s season seven premiere, a source claims Scheana Marie has found herself on the outs with the other ladies of the show, including Stassi Schroeder, Katie Maloney, and Brittany Cartwright, as Billie Lee and James Kennedy reportedly remain outsiders as well.  The cast “is really divided and not getting along,” a source revealed to Hollywood Life on November 27. “Stassi and Katie have been talking behind Scheana’s back, as they feel she’s extremely desperate for attention. It’s really Stassi, Brittany, and Katie versus Scheana, and Scheana really feels left out of everything.”  According to the report, Scheana is upset about her current status with the other women but understands why they are against her.  “It’s hurting her, however, Scheana really was spending so much time with Rob that she was acting like it was the Scheana and Rob show, and now they’re not even together anymore,” the insider explained.  As Vanderpump Rules fans will recall, Scheana’s life revolved around her relationship with Rob Valletta for the entirety of season six and throughout their time together on the show, her co-stars expressed doubt in the longevity of the romance.  In addition to Scheana’s reported feud with her co-stars, the insider said Billie is also on the outs with the cast and was recently involved in a dispute with her boss at SUR Restaurant, Lisa Vanderpump.  “Billie and Lisa also get into it, and it gets so bad that Billie is forced to go to Lisa’s house to apologize,” the source revealed. “None of the girls are speaking to Billie right now as well. They know Billie is really fighting for trans rights, and they whole heartedly support that, however, they feel she’s really difficult to get along with.”  While it wasn’t noted what exactly led to Lisa and Billie’s fight, the insider confirmed they are now on better terms.  “Lisa knows what it feels like to not have anyone want to film with you, so Billie and Lisa have made up completely,” the source said. “Billie feels so excluded right now, and it’s hurtful to her to not want anyone to film with her, which is why it was important to Billie to make up with Lisa.”  Lisa has been in production on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season nine for the past several months but she hasn’t been seen with her co-stars since September, when she attended Denise Richards‘ wedding, due to her feud with the cast.  “The cast is just so divided right now. Producers are excited that the drama is high as is Lisa since this is her baby. She’ll do this show forever as would the cast,” the source continued of the Vanderpump Rules cast.  As for James, the insider added that the men and women of the show are no longer talking to the DJ and have been refusing to invite him to any of their group events.

The archives will remain available here; for new stories, head over to Vox.com, where our staff is covering consumer culture for The Goods by Vox. You can also see what we’re up to by signing up here.  Five years ago, The Mindy Project introduced audiences to the colorful and chaotic world of Dr. Mindy Lahiri, creator and star Mindy Kaling’s alter ego. Since then, we’ve watched Mindy grow both as a working professional and a woman looking for love — and from navigating the New York City dating scene to opening a fertility clinic to becoming a mom, she’s done it all while dressed in some truly memorable clothes.  Today, the sixth and final season premieres on Hulu, and costume designer Salvador Perez went all out for Mindy’s last hurrah. Below, Perez discusses Mindy’s style evolution, dressing the men of Mindy, and what makes the final season’s fashion so special. (Hint: It involves a lot of Dolce & Gabbana.)  How does it feel to be working on the final season of The Mindy Project?  It’s bittersweet. I’m a gypsy; I normally do feature films because I like a beginning and an end. I’ve stayed on for six seasons of The Mindy Project because I’ve been having a great time. Part of me thinks, “All good things come to an end,” and part of me is like, “How can I not shop for this character for the rest of my life?” It’s the dream job. I cannot imagine not shopping for Mindy Lahiri ever again. That’s just daunting to me.  Do you think you’ll be out and about and see pieces that make you think of her?  Oh my god, I’ve done three features in the middle of the show — I’ve done the Pitch Perfect movies and I did Think Like a Man. The whole time I was shopping for those, I was like, “Oh, this will be great for Mindy.” I’d literally pick something up and realize, “Wait, no, I’m not shopping for that show.” It’s such a natural part of what I do — to shop for that character — that it will take a couple years to break my habit of subconsciously shopping for Mindy.  How do you think Mindy’s style has — or hasn’t — evolved over the show’s six seasons?  It’s funny because people always think about Sex and the City as an arbiter of fashion. I’m like, “You’re remembering Sex and the City’s final season. Look at the first six episodes of Sex and the City.” It was not the same show, because you have to find your rhythm. In the first few episodes, you see Miranda in, like, overalls and a parka.  I think it was the same for us. At the beginning of The Mindy Project, it was little cute cardigans layered over a blouse and a skirt. It was color-blocked. But now she’s a full-on fashionista. I mean, the Dolce & Gabbana, the Roksanda, the Prada, the Mary Katrantzou, and all of the custom stuff that we make for her. It’s a completely different show now than it was at the beginning.  I love that you brought up the custom design. I’ve heard that each episode features at least one custom piece.  One custom outfit. So that means dress and coat. [Laughs]  What do you enjoy most about creating those custom looks?  I started out as a fashion designer, and I fell into costume because I could sew. So I’m still a closet fashion designer. To be able to design contemporary fashion for a woman like this is just a dream. It’s what I went to school for. As costume designers, we have many things in our arsenal. I can rent, I can borrow, I can pull. But to be able to build — and building things that don’t exist — is the ultimate. I even have somebody who does hand-knit clothes for us — hand-knit sweaters, skirts, and dresses. That’s how decadent we are on the show.  What have been some of your favorite custom pieces?  I love the finale of season 4, which tied into season 5. Mindy wore that little yellow Madeline dress with the collar and black bow with the matching floral coat.  That was super cute.  It’s one of my favorite pieces. This season alone we’ve done so much. You haven’t seen the episodes yet, but I found this beautiful cream silk fabric with tassels printed on it. I made a purple coat to go with it, and then we sewed tassels on the coat as an embellishment. To be able to be that decadent and to do couture-level clothing on a half-hour sitcom is unheard of.  When we did a flashback to her first day at work, I did a pink jacquard suit lined in a printed silk with a matching silk blouse. Then we trimmed it with pearls and crystals. The fact that I can do that kind of quality work for a TV show is pretty amazing.  Color and embellishment are such a big part of Mindy’s world. Was it a deliberate decision to make her wardrobe so vibrant?  That’s always been my aesthetic. You can talk to any director I’ve ever worked for. It’s like, “Sal, bring the color down. Sal, less crystals. Sal, less rhinestones.” My whole career has been that way. So to finally have a partner who said, “More crystals, more rhinestones, more color,” has been a gift. Mindy lets me do what I want. If it were my world, everybody would live in color.  On that note, does Mindy Lahiri actually own any black or neutral clothing?  We try to keep it special because I think black is such a crutch. I’m like, “No, no — everybody has a little black dress. You can’t wear that.” It’s gotta be chocolate brown or navy blue or hunter green. But every now and then — like at the beginning of season 4, when she had that dream marriage to Matt [Joseph Gordon-Levitt] — I put her in a black plunge dress with crystals. It was appropriate for that. She was in a dream world, and I wanted the dream world to be more black. But I use black very sparingly because I think that’s just the easiest. It’s easy to look great in a black dress. Anybody can do it.  Mindy has some really great loungewear, too. Where do all those stylish pajamas come from?  Those PJs are from Bedhead Pajamas. I love their aesthetic. I go into their showroom at the beginning of each season and buy one of everything. And we always have them in our arsenal. People are like, “Do you have 10, 20 pairs?” Try 60. I have 60 pairs of Bedhead Pajamas. They’re luxurious. They’re comfortable. They’re in great colors. There’s an episode where we had one on her and one on Anna [Rebecca Rittenhouse]. They look great on everybody.  How did you decide that fashionable PJs would be a part of her character’s aesthetic?  As much as Mindy loves being a chic diva, she also likes being comfortable. But she wants to be comfortable and still be a chic diva. So you would never see her in just a T-shirt and sweats. It would be comfy pajamas, because she’s a diva.  You’re not going to see her in a ratty T-shirt from high school.  [Only] if it were scripted that way. I did it once when she slept over at Danny’s [Chris Messina]. But as a general rule, no. Her sleepwear is fabulous. And the real Mindy loves it because it’s the most comfortable thing to wear on set, and she just loves being comfortable.  What can viewers expect fashion-wise in the final season? Will there be anything particularly outrageous or unique?  Let’s just say that I spent $100,000 on Dolce & Gabbana. And we’re using it. There’s a lot of Gucci. It’s our last season. I figured no one could yell at me. They can’t fire me, so I’m just going to spend like the wind.  With the real Mindy expecting, what’s the difference between designing and fitting for a fake pregnancy versus a real one?  When we had the fake pregnancy, Mindy wrote that episode. When I made the pregnancy vest for her, she was like, “Ugh.” And I said, “What do you mean, ugh? You have to wear this.” She hated fitting in the pregnancy vest.  As a general rule, [her real pregnancy] shouldn’t affect us too much because we’ll be done hopefully before she starts showing. Some days after lunch, there is a little bit of a belly, but she still looks great.  What I liked about the pregnancy storyline was that her maternity style didn’t differ much from her actual style.  Which is my philosophy as a designer in general. I remember when I was little, my mom, sisters, and cousins would all buy maternity dresses. That’s over. You just buy a little bit of knit and work it. You might have to buy some maternity jeans. But I don’t think you should have to buy maternity clothes. Why spend the money on clothes that you’ll never wear again? We made a very conscious effort to not buy her maternity clothes. There were just lots of knits.  Describe your conversations with Mindy about designing for the final season. Was there anything she really wanted to see before the show came to an end?  It’s more like an aesthetic. We go to the designers. What do we see? What do we like? We love what Gucci is doing right now. Dolce & Gabbana always has the best prints, so there’s a lot of Dolce & Gabbana. It’s funny because I used to have to do these mixed-prints things myself, but now I’m finding those pieces [already made]. I found an MSGM dress the other day that had two different prints of orange flowers on the top, and an orange and black plaid skirt. I used to have to put those together, and now I can just buy them because people are doing my aesthetic.  So you were way ahead of the curve.  I take full credit for it. I was at Nordstrom, and there was a lace pinafore dress over a polka-dotted blouse. I’m like, “Okay, that’s fully us.” Nobody did that before us. That’s great that we are influencing fashion, because people are taking their clothes and wearing them in ways they never planned on before, which gives them more wardrobe.  I’m not trying to have a huge ego here, but the prints and the way we use prints have really exploded since I’ve been on the show. The reason we started building them is because it wasn’t out there, and now it’s out there. So what came first, the chicken or the egg?  Mindy, when I first met her, did not want to wear prints or florals. I said, “Well, no — they look good, you have to find the right one.” There has to be movement in the fabric. It can’t be repetitive. There has to be a lot of motion. And now she’s on the cover of InStyle in a floral dress, and I’m like, “Ha!”  If you absolutely had to pick, what are a few of your favorite looks from the show?  The green Christmas dress [from season 3]. As a designer, it’s very satisfying to have that idea and to have the resources. I know the beader who beaded [for] Funny Girl and Titanic; she’s a friend of mine, and I got her out of retirement to bead that dress for Mindy. It’s just beautiful. For the fans, seeing the handiwork that was done to that dress is fabulous. Again, the yellow Madeline dress and coat. I love that outfit. It’s the epitome of Mindy’s style — the color-blocking, the floral, the coordination. It’s very Mindy.  The one that people haven’t seen yet is the purple tassel dress. Again, it’s the workmanship.  Are there any supporting characters’ style that you have really enjoyed designing for?  Oh god, yes. People always think of Mindy because the show is called The Mindy Project, but I am very proud of the men on the show. Danny had his little Ralph Lauren look. Jeremy [Ed Weeks] — I mean, I live vicariously through him. If I were to wear a suit every day, I would look like Ed Weeks. He’s a peacock. It’s all purples, blues, and pinks — very put-together and polished. Then they brought in Jody [Garret Dillahunt]. He’s Southern, he wears suspenders, he’s very traditional.  Now that I pull for Jeremy and Jody at the same time, I have to make sure their colors don’t clash and that they aren’t both in blue suits. There’s a little bit of crossover because my whole point is that they were college buddies, so they had to have some similarities. It’s a very funny thing that I’m sure only I notice, but I have a lot of fun with the shirt-and-tie combinations. The men on the show have been equally well-dressed.  That goes across the board to all of our guest stars. Since Mindy’s clothes are heightened and so special, I couldn’t put everybody else in, you know, Gap. It would look odd. So I really heightened everybody around her. Anna, who’s very steely and wears black and navy, is still couture. It’s Roland Mouret, Hugo Boss, and Theory. She’s the complete antithesis of Mindy: There’s no color. There’s no embellishment. It’s very sleek. It’s icy. But I love having that contrast between her and Mindy.  What have you enjoyed most about working on The Mindy Project?  The collaboration with Mindy. You talk to any costume designer, and the biggest part of our job is begging actors for fittings. They don’t want to do it. They don’t want to take the time. They just want to look fabulous, but nobody wants to take the time for fittings because they’re busy.  Mindy has always given me the time. Mindy will give up her lunch break. Mindy will come in on a Saturday. Mindy will stay after work because she understands that fittings are important. I can only make her look that good if I have her try it on, alter it, fit it to her, and accessorize. I will never have a collaborator like Mindy Kaling. She has been there for us and has been a part of the process. She allows me to do my job and inspires me to do my job. She really is my muse.  The Paley Center for Media is hosting a costume exhibit in honor of the show right now. How did that come about?  Hulu had come to us and asked, “Would you consider doing a museum exhibit of the costumes from the show?” And I’m like, “Hello!” It’s a huge honor because the shows that have had exhibits before were Outlander, Hairspray, The Handmaid’s Tale, and American Horror Story — these big, costume-y shows.  The fact that they’re putting our contemporary show in that same category really speaks to the audience and the appreciation of what we’re doing. People think contemporary clothes just happen. I put the same amount of effort — if not more — into my contemporary shows as most people do into period shows. It’s so detailed. A lot of it is built, a lot of it is remade, and a lot of it is layers. When people think contemporary clothes, they think you pull them from the store and that’s it. No, no, no. When you see what I start with and what I finish with, that’s what costume design is.  The exhibit’s been called “immersive.” What will that look like for visitors?  I put so much detail into the clothes that you never see on camera. What I’ve found is that when Mindy puts them on, she notices the beautiful silk linings and the handiwork, and it makes her feel special. I think that shows on camera, but the audience never gets to see any of those details. Now they get to see them up close and personal. And the exhibit not only shows my design work and Mindy’s costumes, but [also] my cutter and fitter support, who have made all of these clothes.  I’m so flattered and honored by the response of the fans [to the show’s clothes]. My Instagram following is huge because of The Mindy Project. People have their favorites, but now they get to actually see them in one room and see the details. I think it’ll be a fun opportunity for the fans.  The Mindy Project season 6 premieres September 12th on Hulu.",real
393,"Is it even a proper Independence Day celebration without fireworks, Stars and Stripes face paint, and photos from one of Taylor Swift's infamous Fourth of July parties? Yes it is, but still the Internet had to do without the latter in 2018, because this was the second year in a row that her home in Watch Hill, Rhode Island was empty on America's birthday. (In other words, perhaps Taylor not celebrating the 4th during Trump's presidency is her biggest political statement yet?)  Instead of holding one of her #squad-powered summer bashes this year, T-Swift chose to spend a break from her current world tour in Turks and Caicos with her boyfriend actor Joe Alwyn.  The couple were spotted all loved up and canoodling on the beach and in the clear tropical waters. And yes, while Swift abandoned America to vacation a British territory islands with her British beau, she was spotted sporting a red, blue, and white striped bikini from swimwear brand Solid and Striped. America represent! 🇺🇸  Taylor and Joe allegedly first met at the 2016 Met Gala, but their ~relationship status~ wasn't confirmed until a year later in May 2017. A source tells People, ""Joe is just an amazing boyfriend. He is very supportive. Taylor adores his family. She’s in a very good place.""  On the few occasions they have been spotted together in public, the couple have always looked like they're absolutely crazy about each other, but have made sure to hide their love from the public eye as much as possible. In fact, these photos mark the first time Taylor and Joe have been spotted together since their lunch date in North London over a month ago. In other words then, this is a far cry from those seemingly-posed, definitely cheesy beach pics with her (also British) ex Tom Hiddleston.  This content is imported from {embed-name}.

1864,"""Hugh Hefner peacefully passed away today from natural causes at The Playboy Mansion, surrounded by loved ones,"" a rep for the Playboy founder told PEOPLE  He was a pioneer of the ’60s sexual revolution, a champion of civil rights and free speech, and created one of the most popular magazines and brand that not only became a playground for Hollywood’s biggest stars, but also changed publishing and pop culture forever.  So it’s fitting that in the wake of the news of Hugh Hefner‘s death, everyone from celebrities to politicians to former Playboy cover models are taking to social media to pay tribute to Hefner and honor his legacy.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  There were those who admired him and enjoyed time at his infamous Playboy mansion, like former BFFs Kim Kardashian West and Paris Hilton — who spent much of Wednesday night sharing memories of Hefner via text.  “RIP to the legendary Hugh Hefner! I’m so honored to have been a part of the Playboy team! You will be greatly missed! Love you Hef! Xoxo,” Kardashian West shared on Twitter. “Paris & I are reminiscing about the Playboy parties at the mansion & how much we love Hef.”  RELATED VIDEO: Hugh Hefner, ‘Playboy Magazine’ Founder and ‘Star of Girls Next Door,’ Dies at 91  There were those who recognized the good he did in the world, like Rev. Jesse Jackson who praised Hefner for being “a strong supporter of the civil rights movement.”  “Hugh Hefner was a GIANT in publishing, journalism, free speech & civil rights. He was a true original, and he was my friend,” wrote Larry King. “Rest well Hef.”  “Few did more for writers, inc myself, breaking boundaries and helping Lenny fight for his 1st Amend Rights,” said Richard Lewis.  And then, of course, there were the Playmates — the stars who became stars in the pages of Playboy, and the celebs who graced the cover of the magazine like Cindy Crawford and Jenny McCarthy.  RELATED VIDEO: Hugh Hefner’s Most Iconic ‘Playboy’ Covers  “RIP #Hef Thank you for being a revolutionary and changing so many people’s lives, especially mine. I hope I made you proud,” McCarthy tweeted along with a photo of her January 2005 Playboy cover.  “RIP @hughhefner thank you for making me part of the Playboy family. Sending lots of love and prayers to @crystalhefner,” said Heidi Montag.  A rep for the Playboy Enterprises founder confirmed the tragic news in a statement to PEOPLE: “Hugh M. Hefner, the American icon who in 1953 introduced the world to Playboy magazine and built the company into one of the most recognizable American global brands in history, peacefully passed away today from natural causes at his home, The Playboy Mansion, surrounded by loved ones.”  Hefner’s son Cooper, who is also the Chief Creative Officer of Playboy Enterprises, also released a statement.  “My father lived an exceptional and impactful life as a media and cultural pioneer and a leading voice behind some of the most significant social and cultural movements of our time in advocating free speech, civil rights and sexual freedom. He defined a lifestyle and ethos that lie at the heart of the Playboy brand, one of the most recognizable and enduring in history. He will be greatly missed by many, including his wife Crystal, my sister Christie and my brothers David and Marston, and all of us at Playboy Enterprises,” said Cooper.  Hefner quickly rose to fame after the first issue of men’s magazine Playboy published in December 1953, which featured a nude Marilyn Monroe. The same year, Hefner launched media and lifestyle company Playboy Enterprises, Inc., on which he served as a board member until the time of his death.  In an August 2017 interview, Hefner’s son Cooper, who took over as chief creative officer of Playboy Enterprises, admitted that it was hard to watch his father get older.  “It’s tough to watch him struggle,” he told The Hollywood Reporter of his father getting older. “But I’m just happy it’s physical and not mental.",fake
9767,"Ah, the January-February doldrums, when all that Hollywood has to offer is Oscar contenders from last year, inane horror flicks and movies with Eddie Murphy in multiple roles. Truly, this is the cruelest season.  And now here we are again, staring down the barrel of yet another Jim Carrey movie. This time he’s starring in thriller “The Number 23” as a guy who starts reading a book called “The Number 23” and discovers that everything in his life is somehow connected numerically to the titular digits. He also starts to suspect that the book might be directly written about him (hello, “Stranger Than Fiction”), which ain’t great news, considering that it ends in murder and bloodshed.  Needless to say, Carrey’s character begins to lose a few of his marbles, scribbling numbers on walls like Russell Crowe in “A Beautiful Mind” and generally foaming at the mouth and frightening those around him. And he has good cause to be worried; the number 23 consists of a two and a three, and as we discover in the film, two divided by three is 0.666, “the number of the devil.” (I suppose there’s no point in mentioning here that two divided by three is actually 0.6666666… which would really be rounded up to the less-than-Satanic 0.667.)  Obviously, the lesson here — apart from “never read a book” — is “numerology has many things to teach us.” I was skeptical, but then I took a good long numerological look at the man once dubbed America’s rubber-faced fartsmith and uncovered a shocking truth: Jim Carrey is the devil. And I don’t mean “devil” in the sense of “lowbrow actor who talks out of his ass.” I mean the actual, literal, capital-D Devil.  Let’s start simply: Take the number of letters in Carrey’s first and last name and you get three and six. Three sixes. 666. Coincidence? Methinks not. He was born in Newmarket, Canada, which is nine letters and then six letters. Add nine and six and you get 15. One plus five is six. You see how this works?  Trending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha  Watch as things turn sinisterCarrey was born on Jan. 17, 1962 — which is, not coincidentally, 13 years to the day after the birth of comedian Andy Kaufman, whom Carrey would play in a 1999 biopic (turn the three nines in 1999 upside down and you get 666). Carrey’s birth date can be written as 1/17/1962, and when you add all the numbers in his birth year (1+9+6+2), you get 18, the same thing you get when you add one (his birth month) and 17 (his birth date). Take the numbers in Carrey’s current age (4+5) and add the number of letters in his hometown, and you again get 18. And what is 18 really? Three sixes.  26 photos Slideshow Celebrity Sightings Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. on the ""Let's Be Cops,"" red carpet, Selena Gomez is immortalized in wax and more.  More recently, the actor has had a spate of bad luck, with three upcoming projects he was at one point attached to getting nixed for one reason or another. There was “A Little Game” (11 letters), which would have found James Carrey (11 letters) reteaming with his “Mask” co-star, Cameron Diaz (11 letters). Add those three 11s and you get 33. Three plus three is six.  Another flick that didn’t seem to get off the ground was “Used Guys” (eight letters) in which Carrey was to star with Ben Stiller (10 letters). Eight plus 10 is 18, and we all know what 18 is — three sixes.  The third movie, “Ripley’s Believe It or Not,” may be alive and breathing again, but I’ll believe it when I see it. Until then, it’s worth noting that attached director Tim Burton, like Carrey, has three letters in his first name and six in his last (easy multiplication gives us 18 again), and that Carrey would play a character named Robert Ripley (two names of six letters each).  Even more reasons to be suspiciousHad enough? Of course not. Carrey’s breakout year was 1994, which saw the release of three movies of his that turned out to be huge and cemented his career: “Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,” “The Mask” and “Dumb & Dumber.” The sum of the digits in the year (1+9+9+4) is 23. Multiply two by three and you get six, which gives you one six for each movie he released that year — 666. Oh, and since “Ace Ventura,” Carrey’s made (you guessed it) 18 movies.  When faced with this mounting heap of evidence, I was left with two possible explanations: Jim Carrey is closely connected to the number of the beast, or numerology is preposterous nonsense and I’d been wasting my time like those conspiracy nuts who claim to draw incontrovertible parallels between John F. Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln.  The obvious conclusion is that Carrey is Satan. QED.  The doubting Thomases among you may be inclined to dismiss this kind of highly scientific analysis as mere data cherry-picking or superstitious hocus pocus. And true, it’s probably too early to start eyeing the skies for a rain of blood or a plague of locusts. But it’s worth pointing out that Mr. Carrey himself has had a keen interest in numerology and the number 23 particularly, since long before he signed on to make the film. He even named his production company JC23 because of his belief in the power of those particular digits. If he buys into it when it comes to his life, why can’t you?  And finally, I’ll leave you with one last bit of telling evidence: An anagram of “Lucifer” is “rice flu.” An anagram of “Jim Carrey” is “my rice jar.” This means something. Think about it.

But the 17-year-old Sports Illustrated cover star has equally impressive skills when it comes to photobombing.  Kim joined Jimmy Fallon on ""The Tonight Show"" Wednesday night and was enlisted in pranking visitors at 30 Rock.  For the skit, unsuspecting fans were offered the chance to take pictures on an Olympic-themed medal podium. As the photographer's camera snapped, Kim, sporting the gold medal she won in Pyeongchang, and Fallon crept in to make goofy poses in the background — including one with Fallon in a blond wig and a knockoff gold medal.  Only after the pics were taken did the mischievous duo reveal themselves to the squealing delight of their victims. They then took proper photos with their fans.  Kim seemed as calm on national television as she did on the halfpipe. The California native, after all, is someone who went for — and landed — difficult back-to-back 1080s on her final run, despite having already secured the win. Why'd she do it?

4085,"A mental health (LPS) conservatorship makes one adult (called the “conservator”) responsible for a mentally ill adult (called the “conservatee”). LPS conservatorships MUST be started by a local government agency, usually a county’s Public Guardian or Public Conservator.  LPS conservatorships last for only 1 year. If they are needed longer than that, they must be restarted and the conservator must be reappointed by the court. The government agency may recommend that a family member of the conservatee be appointed as LPS conservator, but this happens usually only after the first year.    These conservatorships are only for adults who are gravely disabled as a result of a mental illness listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The most common mental illnesses are serious, biological brain disorders, like:  Schizophrenia,  Bipolar disorder (manic depression),  Schizo-affective disorder,  Clinical depression, and  Obsessive-compulsive disorder.  LPS conservatorships are not for people with organic brain disorders, brain trauma, developmental disability, alcohol or drug addiction, or dementia, unless they also have one of the serious mental illnesses listed in the DSM.        Duties and Responsibilities of an LPS Conservator  An LPS conservatorship gives legal authority to the conservator to make certain decisions for a conservatee who is unable to take care of himself or herself. If asked, the court can give an LPS conservator the duty to take care of and protect the conservatee (conservator of the person) and also the power to handle the financial matters of the conservatee (conservator of the estate).    The conservator can consent to mental health treatment even if the conservatee objects. The conservator can agree to the use of psychotropic (mind-altering) drugs. However, the conservatee may refuse to take them if he or she is determined to have enough mental ability to make this decision knowingly and with enough understanding of the consequences.    The conservator can agree to place the mentally ill person in a locked facility if a psychiatrist says it is needed and the hospital agrees to take the person, whether or not the conservatee agrees. The conservator can decide where the mentally ill person will live when he or she is not in a locked psychiatric facility.  The LPS conservator can also make financial decisions for the conservatee, like paying the bills and collecting his or her assets and income.  An LPS conservator must have enough medical and social information before making decisions for the conservatee. And the conservator must only take actions that are in the best interest of the conservatee.",fake

12984,"Jessica Chastain is one of the most outspoken actresses in Hollywood as she is unafraid to publicly comment on controversial topics and take hard line stances on important issues. What she is not is a prepackaged product put together by the public relations firms that work for the major studios. That’s quite the admirable path to take in today’s 24/7 Twitter-verse where you’re constantly on guard against the leering public. But even Chastain would admit that the choice to be a voice of truth in the entertainment industry did not come easily for her.  In a recent interview with the New York Times, Chastain admitted to being shocked that she received a Golden Globes nomination for Aaron Sorkin’s Molly’s Game. She thought her career may actually be in peril after speaking out against the deluge of sexual misconduct allegations being flung around Hollywood.  “To be honest, I’m mainly surprised about my nomination,” she told the outlet. “As an actor, I have a lot of fear, thinking that if I speak my mind, or something that feels like it deviates from the norm as a woman, am I going to be made to disappear in my industry?  “When the article came out about Weinstein, I immediately started tweeting. I’ve got a good group of girlfriends on WhatsApp, and I said, ‘I’m really terrified I’m destroying my career right now. I wonder if people will still see me as an actress, and want to work with knowing I have these opinions,’” she continued. “In the way that only good girlfriends can do, they helped me eliminate fear and understand that the only way to change something that’s wrong is to change it, not ignore it. And rather than saying it’s an industrywide issue, it’s more than that. It’s a society-wide issue. We can’t ignore farmworkers or women who have been invisible.”  Chastain has never been shy on Twitter about calling others out (or going to bat for Robin Wright to be named the lead on the final season of House of Cards, an idea Netflix eventually greenlit). Shortly after the first two exposes took down Harvey Weinstein, she tweeted: “I was warned from the beginning. The stories were everywhere. To deny that is to creat an environment [sic] for it to happen again.” The two-time Academy Award-nominee also spoke out against Kevin Spacey and Brett Ratner amid their own personal alleged scandals.  “I was tweeting a lot at the time and actually got an email from a well-known actor that said, ‘Calm down,’” Chastain said during an appearance on “The Graham Norton Show.” “I found that heartbreaking and can only think he didn’t understand the movement that was happening.”  Following her performance in Molly’s Game and the Golden Globe nomination, Chastain is a dark horse contender for a Best Actress nomination at the Oscars (and a potential star of the planned It sequel). If anything, her vocal presence on Hollywood’s sexual harassment issues, as well as the gender wage gap and other divisive topics, have made her even more popular with fans. But if you needed any other convincing of Chastain’s awesomeness, there’s always this scene from Zero Dark Thirty.",real

Here’s how!  “[Selena Gomez] has been rehearsing like crazy, but she’s still dealing with a lot of nerves ahead of the [American Music Awards].

She’s been so busy getting ready for the AMAs, she doesn’t have as much time to take care of herself.

The outrageous report that has stunned fans around the world In Touch magazine  Nicole and Keith have been married for 12 years, but according to In Touch there are just too many obstacles for the couple to overcome. Nicole has reportedly struggled to deal with the legacy of Keith’s past addiction issues, as well as time apart, and rumours of antics on the road.  ‘They have been putting a Band-Aid over their problems for too long,’ claimed the insider. ‘While they have smiles plastered on their faces in public, in private, things have been falling apart.’  The trip to Vermont marked an attempt to patch things up, according to the publication.  It was allegedly Keith who wanted to take the trip to Vermont with Nicole initially refusing to go, claims In Touch.  ‘They addressed a range of issues including emotional intimacy and focused on the root of their problems as they learned to break down walls and start working on their issues rather than plastering over the cracks,’ explained the source.

3984,"Gwens Stefani had the best time spending her 2016 Thanksgiving with boyfriend Blake Shelton and his family in Oklahoma. We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why she might have to bail on the festivities this year.  Blake Shelton, 41, and Gwen Stefani, 48, have always made holidays together a big priority in their relationship. In 2016 they spent Thanksgiving at his Oklahoma ranch and rang in Christmas at her LA home. They were hoping to do turkey day at his country pad again, but she might have to skip out on the festive meal. “Gwen had the best time with Blake and his family last year at Thanksgiving and she would love to do it all over again. Last year she promised that she’d be back again for this Thanksgiving, but she might have to break her promise. She’s got so much work on her plate all month, it’s going to be very hard for Gwen to pull it all off,” a source close to the singer tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  “It’s crunch time for promoting her Christmas album, she’s got so many interviews lined up she’s even doing a meet and greet in LA on Black Friday. She keeps insisting that she can do it all, that she can have the big traditional feast with Blake and his family on Thanksgiving and then race back to LA for work,” our insider continues. Gwen just dropped her first ever holiday album You Make It Feel Like Christmas, on Oct. 6 and as the season draws closer, she’s going to be everywhere in support of it.  Since the Blakester is the BEST BOYFRIEND EVER, he’s agreed to change up his Thanksgiving plans in Oklahoma if she can’t make it there to spend it with him. “Blake absolutely wants her there with his family, but he’s told her if she needs to stay in LA he’ll be with her. Either way they’re going to be together, but Gwen’s goal is to be superwoman and make it all happen. She doesn’t want to miss out,” our source says. See Blake and Gwen’s relationship milestones in pics, here.  Blake played a big part in Gwen deciding to record a Christmas album, as the idea came to her while going for a run on her boyfriend’s ranch. “What if I did write a Christmas song? What would it be?” she told Billboard magazine. She said that within minutes she came up with a melody and lyrics that she laid down in a voice video as soon as she got back to his house. A few weeks later, she recorded her first ever holiday tune “Christmas Eve.” The title track is a duet between Blake and Gwen that we’re sure will be a total holiday classic for years to come.

9822,"Seven years ago the old Taylor Swift was still alive and well, sipping maple lattes with Jake Gyllenhaal and enjoying brisk fall walks. And while the Taylor-Jake chapter of the pop star's storied dating history was short-lived, it managed to spur one of Hollywood's greatest mysteries: Where in the world is the scarf Taylor sings fondly of in the song ""All Too Well""? (Which is rumored to be about her time with Gyllenhaal.)  Maggie Gyllenhaal, for one, does not know and would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one she never asked to be a part of.  But before we get into that, a quick recap: In 2012 Swift released ""All Too Well"" from her Red album; in it, Taylor laments not only the lost love of an autumn romance—allegedly Jake (""The autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place / And I can picture it after all these days."")—but, even more so, the loss of a scarf. ""Left my scarf there at your sister's house / And you still got it in your drawer even now,"" Taylor sings. The sister in question is of course A-list actress Maggie, who has apparently been accused for the better half of a decade of keeping Tay's beloved fall accessory.  So last night, on Watch What Happens Live, Maggie settled the issue once and for all. ""I never understood why everybody asked me about this scarf. What is this?"" she said. ""I am in the dark about this scarf. It's totally possible [it's at my house]. I don't know. I have been asked this before, and I am like 'What are you talking about?'""  If you take closer look at the lyrics of ""All Too Well,"" it's not surprising that Maggie's in the dark about this scarf. When Taylor sings, ""And you still got it in your drawer even now,"" she clearly means Jake has it in his drawer. Later in the song, she reveals that Jake knowingly has taken custody of the article of clothing, because, love:  Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone But you keep my old scarf from that very first week / 'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me / You can't get rid of it, 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah  So that's that. Jake is the true culprit here, letting his big sis take the rap for years for being, at worst, a thief and, at best, a bad host. And considering Jake has been extraordinarily tight-lipped about his time with the singer, Hollywood will never know what became of that scarf.  Or perhaps Jake sent it back and the new Taylor buried it in that grave, along with all her other bad memories. …  Related: Some Sleuths Think Taylor Swift's Guitars in Her New Ad Might Be a Clue to 'Reputation'",real

3768,"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Photo: Getty Images  Two years ago, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie dropped a bombshell: the Hollywood power couple was splitting up after two years of marriage but roughly 12 years together. What followed were months of back and forth between the (former) couple in the press. There were leaks about custody battles and Pitt’s reported drinking and weed smoking; meanwhile, Pitt gave a candid interview with GQ about the split and his new passion for sculpture and R&B music.  Last summer, there were a slew of new stories, court filings, and suspicious tabloid take-downs in this seemingly never-ending saga. But on Friday, a judge reportedly declared both Pitt and Jolie to be legally single – though their divorce settlement has not yet been finalized.  Here, a look at all that has happened with Brangelina’s divorce.  First, can we look back at their … uh … happier … days?  Sure. The coupling of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie is already Hollywood legend. The pair met while filming Mr. and Mrs. Smith in 2004 — back when Pitt was still married to Jennifer Aniston. Rumors about what may or may not have gone down between Pitt and Jolie on set ran rampant. Eventually, he and Aniston split up, and his relationship with Jolie (officially) came to light. But despite their, erm, salacious start, Pitt and Jolie proved to be the real deal. They were involved for 12 years, and had six kids and a French vineyard together.  So what went wrong?  Back in September 2016, we learned that an “incident” reportedly went down on a private plane, and that the Los Angeles Department of Child and Family Services and FBI got involved. That “incident,” which reportedly involved Pitt and son Maddox Jolie-Pitt, is said to be what prompted Jolie to file for divorce. But in an interview with Vanity Fair in 2017, Jolie made it pretty clear she didn’t want to talk on the record about what happened.  Ah, okay. But what’s happened since then?  Well, a lot. Just on the personal front, Pitt is said to have allegedly sobered up in rehab following the divorce announcement. He also was either involved or just friends with MIT professor Neri Oxman for a while (their exact relationship has always been unclear, despite making countless headlines). Jolie, meanwhile, has kept up with her humanitarian work for the United Nations. But divorce-wise, the Pitt and Jolie hadn’t been able to agree on custody or child-support arrangements — which means they’re still technically married.  Awkward. So, what went down last summer?  As I said, Jolie and Pitt just couldn’t seem to come to an understanding over custody or seemingly anything else tied to their split. The kids had been living in London as Jolie filmed in the U.K., though Pitt is still based in Los Angeles. Back in June, a judge established a schedule for Pitt to spend time with the kids (other than Maddox, who at 16 the court determined was old enough to decide if he wanted to see his dad or not). As a result, Jolie and the kids returned to Los Angeles.  Then, over the summer of 2018, there were a ton of new stories about the couple. It was nearly impossible to keep all these threads straight, so we organized them for you in handy lists:  Jolie’s lawyer drama:  • In early August 2018, TMZ cited a “source connected to Brad” in reporting that Jolie has been so “hostile” in the divorce proceedings that her allegedly fed-up attorney — celebrity divorce lawyer Laura Wasser — is quitting.  • Then, Jolie’s spokesperson denied TMZ’s report to People, saying Wasser is not quitting “now or in the future. But an “insider” did say the divorce was “entering a new phase.”  • By late August, Jolie confirmed that she was parting ways with Wasser. A spokesperson for Jolie, Mindy Nyby, told People in a statement: “Angelina has decided to change counsel to Samantha Bley Dejean, as Samantha’s expertise is the protection and best interest of children.” Then, a “source” told People that Jolie picked the new attorney as the lead counsel in the case “a month ago.”  The back-and-forth about Pitt’s child support payments:  • In legal documents filed on August 7, Jolie’s attorney claimed “Pitt has paid no meaningful child support since separation.” Jolie also asked the court to order Pitt to pay her the money she is owed, CNN reports.  • But that same day, a “source” told People that Pitt has actually paid “easily millions” toward child support since the 2016 split.  • Around that same time, documents obtained by the Daily Mail, Pitt said that he has paid more than $1.3 in “bills” for the children and loaned Jolie $8 million — and he wants to collect interest on the loan.  • Jolie countered that a loan “is not child support.”  And of course, the petty tabloid stories:  A constant in the battle between Jolie and Pitt were the seemingly never-ending tabloid stories attacking one party at a time. Here are a select few:  • “Page Six” reported on August 7 that a “source” close to Pitt slammed Jolie’s child support filing as a “publicity stunt.”  • On August 15, Us Weekly had an “exclusive” on how Jolie is attacking Pitt because she knows joint custody is a “done deal.” The story paints Pitt as the victim.  • “Page Six” had a bizarre story on August 20 about how Jolie is jealous of Amal Clooney. It also says that the Clooneys have taken Pitt’s side in the divorce battle. Hmmm …  • A “source” told Entertainment Tonight on August 23 that Pitt is “sickened” that Jolie is letting their custody battle be aired in public.  • Again, “Page Six” went for Jolie on August 25 — with a story about how she is not the “saint” she appears to be. Lainey Gossip points out that by now, it’s clear how these stories about Jolie keep getting out.  Luckily, they eventually reportedly reached a “truce,” which sounds nice.  Entertainment Tonight reported in September that Jolie and Pitt had a reached a “truce.” A “source” told ET: “Brad and Angelina actually set up a secret meeting at her house. It’s the first time they have truly gotten together to make things work since their group therapy with the children. Brad and Angie’s meeting was a success. They are going to stay with the plan set forth through the courts.” This reportedly means that they are going to “create a calmer situation for the kids.” Good.  Then, they headed to court in early December.  According to TMZ, a custody hearing date has finally been set for Pitt and Jolie in early December in California. The former pair have reportedly filed docs asking a judge to give them until June to sort out the final details of their divorce (with the use of a private judge, who will also help them figure out the division of property), but on December 4, their custody trial is set to start. TMZ notes that Jolie still wants sole custody, while Pitt wants joint custody of their children. The trial will reportedly take two to three weeks.  And now, they’re both legally single (though not yet technically divorced).  E! News reports that as of Friday, a judge has declared both Pitt and Jolie to be legally single. The judge issued a bifurcated judgment, according to The Blast, which means that their marriage is essentially over, even though they are still finalizing their divorce settlement and custody agreement.

4072,"Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber's on-again, off-again relationship is making headlines once again, after the pop stars were spotted together on a recent breakfast-and-church date.  Fans may be speculating whether or not the one-time couple's romance is rekindling, especially amid reports of Gomez and The Weeknd splitting up, or if they're just friends. It's hard say: Gomez and Bieber's storied relationship has gone from breaking up and making up and from ""I am so beyond done with talking about that"" to ""I'm never going to stop loving her.""  ""Sometimes love isn't a feeling but a choice,"" Bieber posted on Instagram in 2014. In an interview published a year later, he spoke candidly of his ex and circled back to that quote: ""Love is a choice. Love is not a feeling. People have made it seem in movies that it's this fairy tale. That's not what love is. You're not gonna want to love your girl sometimes but you're gonna choose to love her.""  Below, check out a play by play of the couple's relationship -- at least, the parts that have been seen through the public eye.  December 2010: It All Started With Pancakes  They first met in 2009. A year later, when Bieber was 16 and Gomez was 18, the two apparently shared a meal and some laughs -- and maybe took part in some hand-holding? -- at an IHOP in Philadelphia.  Gomez apparently exclaimed to US that ""it was just pancakes!"" but a week later, they were seen together again by Bieber's tour bus in Miami, where he had a concert. Those who were really paying attention noticed Bieber had his arm placed on Gomez's back.  Bieber brushed it off by calling Gomez ""an amazing person"" and telling MTV he was ""just having fun being a teenager.""  January 2011: Caught Kissing in the Caribbean  The young maybe-lovebirds still weren't saying a thing about their rumored relationship, but the pictures said plenty.  Gomez and Bieber were photographed on vacation together, kissing and embracing on a private yacht in St. Lucia.  February 2011: Holding Hands & Going Red Carpet Official  After being photographed together again, this time hand in hand in Santa Monica, Calif., the new teen idol couple made their first real appearance together at a Vanity Fair after-party for the 2011 Oscars in Hollywood.  Bieber looked sharp in a black suit, while Gomez turned heads in a stunning red gown -- but more importantly, they arrived arm in arm on the party's red carpet.  Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber arrives at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party at the Sunset Tower in Los Angeles on Feb. 27, 2011. AP Photo/Carlo Allegri  March 2011: Thanks to Ellen, Selena Will Never Spend a Night Alone  There was no denying she was dating Bieber by now, so Gomez was a good sport when Ellen DeGeneres teased the singer about their relationship. In fact, she even accepted a very special gift from the daytime talk show host: a pillow with her boyfriend's face.  ""He's gonna make me sleep with this every night,"" she admitted.  May 2011: Smooching at the Billboard Music Awards  At the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, Gomez and Bieber were seen sharing some PDA yet again, this time with a kiss. Things were still sweet a few months into their budding romance.  September 2011: A Romantic Date Alone ... At the Staples Center  In a grand gesture, Bieber planned a kind of night out with his girlfriend that's not easily replicated. The two had the entire Staples Center to themselves, where they apparently enjoyed a private viewing of Titanic.  “Romance isn’t dead,” Bieber tweeted after their romantic date. “Treat your lady right fellas.”  romance isnt dead. treat your lady right fellas. #REAL — Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) September 24, 2011  February 2012: Diamonds for Valentine's Day  Around the time of Valentine's Day in 2012, Gomez showed off a new sparkly ring in a photo on Twitter. The ring appeared to be made up of diamonds shaped in the letter 'J,' and her hand was being held by (one can only guess) Bieber.  ""I'm finally home,"" she tweeted along with the picture.  April 2012: Selena's 'Humiliating' Kiss Cam Moment  The couple's outing to a Lakers game ended up majorly embarrassing Gomez, after their faces showed up on the kiss cam and they found themselves obligated to, you know, kiss.  “Oh God, that was probably the most humiliating thing that’s ever happened to me,” she told Ryan Seacrest. “We were watching and I thought it was funny, and they were showing little elderly couples and it was so cute. And all of a sudden we’re both looking up and we come on [the screen] and it’s like… it was so awkward. It was so weird. I mean you have to kiss, right?”  November 2012: Selena & Justin Break Up  The Associated Press confirmed Gomez and Bieber went their separate ways, with other outlets reporting that ""distance"" and ""busy schedules"" were the reason for the split heard 'round the pop world.  April 2013: A Snuggly Snapshot  Rumors swirled about the couple revisiting their romance, but some seemingly concrete evidence came when Bieber shared a shirtless Instagram photo in which he was being embraced by his ex.  ""'You've been makin music for too long babe come cuddle' -her,"" he captioned the picture.  May 2013: A GIFable Moment  After another awards show round, a brief backstage happening made its rounds around the internet.  Gomez and Bieber were spotted sharing a quick kiss. Meanwhile, Gomez's bestie Taylor Swift reacted to the scene by turning away and sticking her tongue out.  i hope taylor gives selena THAT LOOK after seeing her with justin again pic.twitter.com/6xLHVs3oPI — • (@Splasharesongs) October 29, 2017  January 2014: Some Quality Time Together  After a quiet period, the pair was spotted by TMZ casually riding Segways together in Calabasas. Bieber also shared a photo of the two on Instagram with the caption ""love the way you look at me.""  Early November 2014: The Power of 'The Heart Wants What It Wants'  Likely inspired by her relationship with Bieber, Gomez dropped a personal new song along with a music video.  Opening ""The Heart Wants What It Wants,"" a emotional voiceover from Gomez said, ""I know him though, and I know that I know his heart, and I know what he wouldn't do to hurt me. But I didn't realize that I'm feeling so confident and feeling so great about myself and then it [can] just be completely shattered by one thing. By something so stupid. But then you make me feel crazy, you make me feel like it's my fault. I was in pain.""  Meanwhile, Bieber posted a quote on Instagram that was interpreted to be his response: ""Sometimes love isn't a feeling but a choice."" He added, ""It's easy to love when you feel it, but love when it's hard to love.""  Mid-November 2014: Justin Unfollows Selena on Instagram  It was unclear what drama caused him to do this, but fans certainly took notice when Bieber stopped following Gomez on Instagram.  Some speculated that he wasn't thrilled by the cozy photo she'd posted with her ""The Heart Wants What It Wants"" music video co-star. ""I think [Justin] was a little jealous of the video guy at first,"" the singer had previously told Ryan Seacrest.  June 2015: 'Where Are U Now,' Selena?  In the video for Bieber's ""Where Are U Now"" collaboration with Skrillex and Diplo, Selena's name clearly makes a cameo.  ""Justin wrote this record during a tough time in his life and it comes to us that sometimes, as artists, we are also just objects and we have to take that as much as we have to use that to create,"" Skrillex and Diplo said in a statement.  September 2015: Justin's 'What Do You Mean' Video References Selena  Bieber may have been reaching out to Selena in his ""What Do You Mean"" music video.  Some super observant fans noticed that her name was spray-painted on a wall of graffiti in the clip for the song, in which he sings lines like ""First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right/ Wanna argue all day, make love all night.""

I’ve deserved this. I earned it. This is all me.”  “At this point, there is no anger,"" she said in an interview with Refinery29. ""There's closure in a very good, healthy way. We’ve seen each other. I'm always encouraging and I am proud of his journey.  She added: ""I think people are making it out to be something that is more tragic than it really was. We grew up together. We both made mistakes. That's it.""  Mid-October 2015: A Justin & Selena Duet?  One night on OVO Sound Radio, an unreleased song that had the former couple trading vocals came out of nowhere. The track had lyrics about wanting to work things out in a relationship, and Bieber singing the line “Gotta be strong, strong, strong” in the chorus.  It turned out the song was written two years prior and wasn't meant to be released, but it sure had fans wondering what was going on at the time.  May 2015: A Mini Reunion  The two reportedly attended the same church service one weekend, and they were spotted being goofy in a Snapchat video posted by a preacher.  August 2015: Selena Throws Some Shade on the 'Jelena' Obsession  The couple's relationship -- referred to as ""Jelena"" by many -- may have seen its downfall due to their young age and being overly exposed by the media, according to Gomez.  ""It's difficult for people to separate us. The internet wants to freeze this moment in time and constantly repeat it,"" she told the U.K.'s Sunday Times.  ""I didn't think I was doing anything bad by falling in love,"" the singer said. ""There's such an emphasis on people being the perfect thing and then destroying them because it's good press. Throw in the fact that you are a teenager -- it makes it more difficult.""  September 2015: What Justin Learned  While he didn't say her name, Bieber described his intense relationship with Gomez in an interview with Complex.  ""I moved in with my girlfriend when I was 18,"" he said. ""Started my own life with her. It was a marriage kind of thing. Living with a girl, it was just too much at that age. But we were so in love. Nothing else mattered. We were all about each other.  ""But when it’s like that and you get your value from that, people will always disappoint you,"" he went on. ""Your girl or your dude, they’re always going to disappoint you. Your full identity can’t be in that person. My identity was in her. Her identity was in me. When stuff would happen, I would lose my freakin’ mind, and she would lose her mind, and we would fight so hard because we were so invested in each other. Love is a choice. Love is not a feeling. People have made it seem in movies that it’s this fairy tale. That’s not what love is. You’re not gonna want to love your girl sometimes but you’re gonna choose to love her. That’s something in life that I had to figure out.""  Early November 2015: 'A Love That Never Really Dies'  In a Billboard cover story, Bieber proclaimed, ""When you love someone that much, even if something comes between you, it’s a love that never really dies.""  In an interview with Access Hollywood around the same time period, he admitted that at least three of the tracks on his Purpose album were about Gomez. On an Ellen appearance, he revealed the titles of those songs -- ""Sorry,"" ""What Do You Mean"" and ""Mark My Words"" -- and mused that someday they ""could maybe come together and make an awesome duo"" once again.  ""It was really tough. I don't know if I'm over it yet,"" Bieber said of their breakup at the time.  ""[She] is someone I love dearly,"" he went on. ""I'm never going to stop loving her. I'm never going to stop checking in on her. I don’t think if you end a relationship, you should end that, unless it was super toxic and you guys were hurting each other physically or mentally. We always respected each other and we still respect each other.""  ""I don’t know what happens. I don't know what is going to happen in the future. I think we both gotta do some soul searching ourselves and figure out ourselves before we can just try to figure out each other,"" he added.  Late November 2015: Selena's Still His Sunshine on a Cloudy Day  Over a year after they were last seen out in public with one another, Bieber made a crystal clear statement when he serenaded his former flame with ""My Girl"" at a hotel bar. The pair reportedly left together, according to footage captured by TMZ.

During the same period, Gomez congratulated him on winning a Grammy for ""Where Are U Now"": “I’m very happy for him. Honestly, so cool,"" she said.  March 2016: Justin Lets Us in on All the 'Feels'  Throwing it back yet again, Bieber showed everyone he was still thinking about his romance with Gomez by posting an old photo of the former couple locking lips.

She reportedly commented, “If you can’t handle the hate, then stop posting pictures of your girlfriend lol- It should be special between you two only. Don’t be mad at your fans. They love you and supported you before any one ever did.”  January 2017: Justin's Not a Weeknd Fan  While word was getting out that Gomez had started dating The Weeknd, Bieber didn't have anything nice to say about it.

October 2017: Back to Breakfast  Following reports that Gomez and The Weeknd broke up, she was seen meeting Bieber for breakfast and going to church with him.

3210,"Johnny Depp: Disney bosses hated Jack Sparrow character... and asked if he was 'gay'    Angering the suits: Johnny Depp has told how Disney bosses 'couldn't stand his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow  Captain Jack Sparrow has quickly become one of the best loved characters in cinema history.  But the actor behind the eccentric pirate has revealed how Disney bosses initially hated his take on the character.  Johnny Depp revealed: 'They couldn’t stand him. They just couldn’t stand him.  'I think it was Michael Eisner, the head of Disney at the time, who was quoted as saying, ""He’s ruining the movie.""'  After working on so many independent, quirky films like Sleepy Hollow and Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas, Depp's performance in the first Pirates film in 2003 brought him back to the mainstream.  But it appeared the actor decided to have a bit of fun with Disney executives, who were used to releasing clean-cut, family-friendly entertainment.    The 47-year-old, currently promoting new film The Tourist, says he wasn't bothered by who he calls 'Upper-echelon Disney-ites, going, ""What’s wrong with him? Is he, you know, like some kind of weird simpleton? Is he drunk? By the way, is he gay?""  'And so I actually told this woman who was the Disney-ite… ""But didn’t you know that all my characters are gay?"" Which really made her nervous.'  In the interview in Vanity Fair magazine, conducted by American singer Patti Smith, Depp also reveals how he was careful not to stand too close to his The Tourist co-star Angelina Jolie during filming in Venice, in case they gave the wrong impression.  In order to avoid speculation about an on-set affair, the actor says he went to great lengths, including 'having to hide, sometimes not even being able to talk to each other in public because someone will take a photograph and it will be misconstrued.'  The father-of-two says he was apprehensive about meeting Jolie before filming: 'You don’t know what she might be like - if she has any sense of humor at all,' he tells Smith.    'I was so pleased to find that she is incredibly normal, and has a wonderfully kind of dark, perverse sense of humour.'  Eccentric: The actor reveals how one studio boss asked him: 'What’s wrong with him? Is he, you know, like some kind of weird simpleton? Is he drunk? Is he gay?'  He also found sympathised with the paparazzi attention she and partner Brad Pitt attracted on set.  He explained: 'Poor thing, dogged by paparazzi, her and her husband (sic), Brad…all their kids.    'There are times when you see how ridiculous is this life, how ludicrous it is, you know, leaving your house every morning and being followed by paparazzi.'  The pair spent several months in the Italian city filming for the thriller, which is released on December 10, in Spring this year.  Meanwhile Depp has just completed filming Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, in London.  Avoiding rumours: Depp was careful not to look to close with his The Tourist co-star, Angelina Jolie, pictured together during filming in Venice  The latest installment sees Depp step back into Sparrow's shoes alongside new addition Penelope Cruz.  He has also signed on to return to the Caribbean in adventure-drama The Rum Diary with Aaron Eckhart and Giovanni Ribisi, about a journalist working for a run-down newspaper in the Caribbean.  But there is one character he is itching to try his hand at. 'Marlon Brando said, ""Why don’t you just take a year and go and study Shakespeare, or go and study Hamlet.

3392,"For the theatre director with pseudonym Anmer Hall, see Alderson Burrell Horne  Anmer Hall is a Georgian country house in the village of Anmer in Norfolk, England. It is 12 miles (19 kilometres) northeast of King's Lynn, 2 mi (3 km) east of the Queen's residence at Sandringham[1] and 2 mi (3 km) west of Houghton Hall. Anmer Hall was a wedding gift to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge from the Queen.[2]  The current house was built in the 18th century and has formed part of the Sandringham estate since 1898. The house was registered as a Grade II* listed building in 1984 but was later de-listed.[3]  History [ edit ]  The current late-Georgian house dates from the 18th century, although it may be built around an earlier core. It has two storeys and attic with dormer windows. The long south front comprises 13 bays, and was refaced with red bricks c. 1815. It has 13 ground-floor windows set in blank arches and a semicircular porch on two Tuscan columns, with 11 windows on the first floor. The three central bays are topped by a pediment. The north front is of rubble carrstone and includes four c. 17th-century ogee-headed sashes on the first floor. Renovations c. 1900 added a brick dressed skin to the north front, together with a projecting entrance porch and a tower towards the eastern end, in the corner formed with a carrstone service wing also added c. 1900.  The surrounding estate became a scheduled ancient monument in 2003, and includes earthworks marking the sites of buildings from the medieval village of Anmer.[4] The village church, St Mary, lies close to the house, but a short distance away from the modern village.  Occupants [ edit ]  Anmer Hall was the seat of the Coldham family from at least 1705. The nearby Sandringham estate was bought by Queen Victoria in 1862 as a wedding present for the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, and neighbouring land was added to the estate in subsequent years.  In 1896, the Anmer Hall estate was purchased at auction for £25,000 by the famed serial fraudster[5] Ernest Terah Hooley before his first bankruptcy. The Prince had attempted to purchase the property prior to Hooley's acquisition.[6] Through an intermediary, the Prince asked Hooley that he be allowed to purchase it from him, ostensibly for his daughter Maud. Hooley agreed, allowing him to buy it at cost in 1898. It has been alleged that a motivation for the Prince's action was to avoid the possibility of Hooley's business promoter Alexander Meyrick Broadley, whom the Prince had earlier forced from society, from becoming a constant guest on the estate, and therefore near-neighbour.[7] Together with the Prince's eldest son and an equerry, Broadley had been implicated in the Cleveland Street scandal.[8][9]  Anmer Hall, shown with new roof, in October 2014  Anmer Hall was leased to John Loader Maffey, 1st Baron Rugby (1877–1969), who was to become Governor-General of the Sudan, Permanent Secretary of the Colonial Office and wartime Ambassador to Dublin. His daughter Penelope (1910–2005) socialised with the Royal Family, and was reportedly a favourite of King George V.  From 1972 to 1990, the house was leased to the Duke and Duchess of Kent as their country house. In February 1990, the Duke and Duchess of Kent moved to Crocker End House in Nettlebed in Oxfordshire. From 1990 to 2000, it was rented by Hugh van Cutsem (1941–2013).[1] It was then leased to the family of James Everett, owner of kitchen timber company Norfolk Oak.[10]  In January 2013, it was reported that the Queen had allocated Anmer Hall for use by the Duke of Cambridge, his wife the Duchess of Cambridge and family.[11][12][13] The lease to the Everett family was terminated early, before its expiry in 2017, to allow redevelopment.[14]  To accommodate the Duke and Duchess using the house as their main residence whilst William worked as a pilot for East Anglian Air Ambulance, a £1.5 million refurbishment programme was put in place. Paid for from private Royal family funds, this included: a complete new roof; new kitchen; the addition of a conservatory designed by architect Charles Morris (who previously designed extensions to Highgrove House);[1] complete internal redecoration; and an extensive tree-planting programme to afford the Duke and Duchess greater privacy.[15]",fake

If I were you, I’d do me.”  The music video, which she released alongside the new tune, features a simple close-up shot of Gomez’s mouth as she sings the entirety of the racy song, brushing her finger against her lips.

7663,"The Awkward Girl’s Guide to Walking in Heels  01.  Work your way up  If you’ve never worn heels on a regular basis, a pair of 6″ stilettos probably isn’t the best place to start. Instead, go for something mid-height, and, once you’re used to walking in those, start to gradually work your way up. Thinking about it now, I reckon this is how I “learned” how to walk in high heels: I wasn’t aware of it as a learning process at the time, but I know the heels I considered super-high as a teenager, say, would feel pretty low to me now, so I think I started small and moved up without really noticing.  02.  The thicker the heel, the easier it is to walk on it  In general, the thinner the heel, the harder it’ll be to balance on it, so when you’re still getting used to walking in high heels, choose thicker, sturdier heels, which will give the foot more stability and give you more confidence.  03.  Platform soles make high heels feel lower  Platform shoes might look crazily high, but they can actually be much easier to walk in than non-platforms, as the platform makes the heel feel shorter. A four-inch heel with a one-inch platform, for instance, will feel like you’re walking on a three-inch heel, which is a lot more reasonable!  04.  Wedges feel like flats, but look like heels  If you’re really struggling to walk in high heels, wedges are your friends. Because of the extra arch support, and the fact that the sole of the shoe is completely flat, they’ll give you height (sometimes a LOT of height) without forcing you to do much in the way of balancing. They’re the most comfortable type of high heels to walk in, and also probably the easiest, so they make an excellent starting point if you can’t walk in high heels, and want to learn.  05.  If the shoe fits…  …it’ll be a whole lot easier to walk in. Fit is particularly important with heels, because if you’re struggling just to keep them on your feet (or wincing in pain every time your foot hits the ground), you’ll find it practically impossible to walk in them. In fact, shoes that are constantly slipping off your foot can actually be dangerous, because you run the risk of stepping right out of them, or going over on your ankle. It’s almost too obvious to write down, but buy shoes that fit, and you’ll find them much easier to wear. There’s no substitute for shoes which fit perfectly, but if you’re having issues with the heels slipping, you can buy heel grips to make them feel a little more secure.  06.  Never wear new shoes without breaking them in  This goes for ANY shoes, really (The worst blisters I’ve had have all come from flats!), but if you can’t walk in heels, it could be because you haven’t worn them in properly. A lot of people swear by just wearing them around the house, or while you’re doing the vacuuming or whatever – you might feel a bit like Freddie Mercury in the ‘I Want to Break Free’ video, but it’ll help you get used to walking in heels and, well, there are worse people you could look like.  07.  Place your heel on the ground first  High heels don’t just make you walk taller, they also force you to walk differently. In flats, sneakers or flip flops, your full foot hits the ground more or less at the same time. In heels, however – and particularly in very high heels – this method won’t only feel uncomfortable and awkward, it’ll look like that, too. Instead, you need to adapt the way you walk so that your heel comes into contact with the ground first, followed by the rest of the foot. This might take a bit of getting used to, which brings me to my next point…  08.  Practice. Then practice some more.  If you’re not used to walking in high heels, it’ll feel very unnatural and awkward the first time you try it. And if you simply give up after that, and don’t try again for a few months or years, it’ll feel awkward and unnatural the NEXT time you try it, too… and the time after that, and the time after that. Practice is the key, and as silly as it might sound, you might find it useful to try to practice in front of a mirror (or get someone to film you, even): sometimes being able to see yourself walk will help you identify anything you’re doing wrong, and work out what you need to change. I know a lot of people who think they can’t walk in high heels because they’ve tried it a couple of times, found it tricky, and given up. Obviously no one is born knowing how to walk in high heels – when you think about it, it’s a really un-natural thing to do, so it makes sense that you might have to train yourself to do it!    09.  Baby steps  I’m not still talking about practising, or working your way up here, I mean literally take baby steps. Like it or not, you can’t really stride or run in heels (well, you can, and once you know how to walk in high heels, running in them won’t seem like a big deal, but you’re probably going to want to wait until you’ve mastered the “walking” bit first!), and if you try to march along with your arms swinging by your sides, it might look a little bit unnatural. Again, being able to see yourself in a mirror will really help with this, and you should instantly be able to see what looks natural, and what doesn’t. In general, though, try to take smaller, slower steps than you would in lower shoes and don’t try to run before you can walk!  10.  Relax  A lot of women have a tendency to hold themselves very stiffly when they’re learning how to walk in high heels. This is partly because of the different way your body moves in heels (your might think your feet and legs are doing all the work, but your lower back and abdomen are working hard too, and are often the first places you’ll feel the strain if you’ve been overdoing it), of course, but it’s also natural to stiffen up if you’re feeling off-balance. Try to relax: not only will it look more natural, it’ll also be more comfortable, and make you less likely to hurt yourself.  11.  Rough up the soles  One of the biggest issues people have when learning how to walk in high heels is slippage: a lot of high heeled shoes have soles which are completely smooth, and don’t offer any grip at all, and that makes them even harder to walk in than would otherwise be the case. (Because it really needs to be even harder, right?) This is particularly true of brand new shoes, and is one of the reasons I’ve talked about breaking shoes in before you wear them: if the soles are slippy, however, wearing them around the house won’t help – they really need to be worn outside for the sole to roughen up enough to make it easier to grip. If you don’t want to wear your new heels outdoors quite yet, you can do it yourself by gently rubbing the soles with sandpaper (yes, really) or using scissors to carefully score the soles: if you’re still worried, you can also buy stick-on soles which will give your shoes more grip.  12.  Remember not all high heels are created equal  You’d think that if you can walk easily in one pair of heels, you’ll be able to walk easily in them all, but that’s not actually the case. What can look like tiny differences in the design of a shoe can make a huge difference to how it feels to wear it, and how easy it is to balance in it: I have some very high shoes, for instance, which are easier to walk in than shoes that are a bit lower – it’s all down to the design, so just because the first pair of heels you try don’t work for you, it doesn’t mean you should give up: it might just mean you need to shop around a bit and find a pair that’s more suited to your foot /step.  13.  Don’t force it  For my final point (Which should possibly have been my first point, because it’s an important one…), I just want to make it clear that no one should feel like they HAVE to wear high heels. I’ve written this post in order to (hopefully) help those who WANT to wear them, and who’ve specifically asked how to walk in high heels, but if they’re just not for you, then there’s no reason in the world to force yourself to wear them. It also goes without saying that if you have foot, leg or back issues, or any other kind of physical issue that would make heel-wearing difficult or dangerous, for the love of shoes, don’t wear them. Your feet are more important than any pair of shoes!  What about you? Any tips on how to walk in high heels? How did you learn?  Read next:  It’s no secret that I love my high heels, and while I don’t wear them exclusively (I’m not one of those shoe-lovers who’ll insist on wearing stilettos, no matter what the situation!), I do wear them on a pretty regular basis: which means I get to spend a lot of time answering questions like the ones above – or less polite ones, like, “Do you REALLY wear those shoes all the time? Are you crazy, woman?” and “Do you have veiny feet? Can I have a photo of them?”(Answers: Yes, Probably, and YUCK…)  I’ll be honest: I really struggle to know how to answer these questions. Some pairs of heels are definitely less comfortable than others, but in general, I’ve never found them particularly difficult to walk in. I can’t remember ever “learning” how to walk in high heels, either, which means that when people ask me how I do it, I always have to think about it for a bit, and try not to answer with, “Um, I just… walk?”  Today, though, I’ve had a good long think about the fine art of walking in high heels, and I present to you my best tips on how to do it. I’d love to hear from other heel wearers on this, though, especially those of you who found walking in high heels difficult at first, but figured out how to do it: what was your method?

Tristan Thompson has slapped Khloe Kardashian with a shocking list of demands after his explosive cheating scandal, RadarOnline.com learned exclusively.  The NBA star amped up his controlling behavior “in return for staying in Khloe’s life in the long-term,” spilled a family insider.  “Tristan continues to insist he’s done nothing wrong, and blames Khloe’s family for exaggerating his womanizing and trying to ruin his reputation.”  Thompson refused to back down as confused Kardashian continued to struggle with her decision of whether to stay or leave her cheating baby daddy.  “He’s willing to walk away, but Khloe’s desperate to work this out, so Tristan’s in the driving seat right now.”  Ultimatums were set for the KUWTK star on the heels of his infidelity.  “He’s agreed to stick around for now, but only if the family stops spreading stories, and he gets cut into Khloe’s portion of profits for the show,” the source added.  “He wants Khloe to let him see True any time he wants and insists she should fly out to meet him where he is,” said the insider. “He can’t just jump on a plane to L.A. when he’s got a game coming up.”  “What’s really galling here is Tristan’s ‘you owe me’ attitude. Khloe is actually considering some but not all of Tristan’s demands.”  The new mom, 33, has struggled with the idea of giving Thompson, 27, another chance.  As Radar previously reported exclusively, the reality star was toying with the idea of ditching her baby daddy for Los Angeles after being holed up with him in Cleveland.  However, it seems she’s sticking with her badly-behaving boyfriend — at least for now. On Friday, May 4, Kardashian and Thompson were spotted together at the TownHall restaurant in Cleveland. Then the following day, she was seen supporting her man from the stands at the Cavaliers game.  We pay for juicy info! Do you have a story for RadarOnline.com?

5520,"Months ago, I waffled over whether to re-read American Gods before the TV show started airing. Did I want to experience the show as its own unique thing or should I go back to the book and reacquaint myself with the plot? The decision to go back to Neil Gaiman’s modern fantasy epic won out and I feel like I made the right choice, one that will change the way I watch the series.  Advertisement  Based on what I’ve seen of the upcoming American Gods TV show, the main difference between the series and the award-winning 2001 novel it’s based on will be one of tonal approach. Both things tell the same story, where an ex-con named Shadow acts as bodyguard to older con man Wednesday as the latter prepares for a reckoning between old and new gods, but the color gradients feel different.    The TV adaptation of American Gods glimmers more brightly than the book. It’s not in the art direction or color choices so much as the self-consciously askew aesthetic of the show, which presents a fictional landscape where celestial energies are still flowing through the world. They show up in sharp neon contrast to the mundanity that we know. There’s a puckish playfulness in the performances, special effects, and shot angles that make the Starz series vibrate on a radiant wavelength.  Advertisement  Revisiting the book while encountering the show makes the original text feel like it’s done up in a somber, more nuanced palette. Gaiman’s 2001 novel wears its intentions on its lapel like a boutonniere flower and is more of a character piece concerned with sketching out Shadow’s reactions to the long, strange trips he gets sent on. American Gods’ journey is one that happens through texts and traditions and Shadow’s arc throughout the book has him meeting deities and culture heroes who have been long forgotten. The book shows that we lose important pieces of the past when society moves on to worship new phenomena.  One thing the show won’t be able to do is seductively evoke an encyclopedic knowledge of myth and literature the way Gaiman does in the book. It’s long been a snarky compliment that Gaiman writes so he can show off what he’s read and American Gods teems with tangents and asides concerned with mythological ephemera from cultures all over the world. This signature practice rarely comes across as self-indulgent, though, because Gaiman makes it clear why he’s telling you about piskies, djinn, or thunderbirds. You might need to wait several hundred pages for the payoff, but the trust he asks for is earned.    The book clearly means to be a sweeping consideration of the metaphysics of the polyglot American soul, talking about what it means to believe in a higher power, move to a new land, and how the latter act impacts the former. There’s a cycle that American Gods investigates in an appropriately itinerant fashion: native people were here on this continent, other people came—either by free will or in bondage—and then displaced them in horrific ways. The migration patterns and available levels of agency for various groups changed over the centuries, but it was a constant that these different peoples had faith systems and folkways that they bought with them. In highlighting the different textures and bracing similarities of the small towns, big cities and dangerous dreamscapes that Shadow moves through, Gaiman illuminates the promise and threat of the idea that America is a place where anything can happen.    Advertisement  Having just finished re-reading the 750-page, author’s preferred version of American Gods, I’m thinking that there’s no way that the show will be able to touch on everything Gaiman accomplishes in the novel. Book passages do get used almost verbatim in the show, but the audience’s demands on the two forms of entertainment are so different that changes have to happen. But I like knowing where the book went and seeing where the show will diverge. I already prefer the TV version of Laura and Technical Boy to their book counterparts because they feel more aligned to the current cultural moment.  That kind of cross-media change isn’t a new paradigm, but the effect here winds up making the book’s very existence even more mythological. Now the novel is itself a metaphorical story that’s being built upon and re-interpreted for a new age, like the myths that Gaiman builds on. American Gods is a meta-myth that’s getting a new layer laid on top of it, an exceedingly appropriate fate for a book about what happens to gods as the times and places change.",real

9826,"After escaping her reportedly intense marriage to mega-star Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes was probably looking for a sense of calm and stability in her next serious relationship.  But it’s questionable whether the “Dawson’s Creek” alum has found that with Jamie Foxx, with multiple reports suggesting that the Oscar-winning actor hasn’t been able to let go of his flirtatious, bachelor ways.  “No one understands why Katie loves a man who can’t seem to commit or why he’s publicly humiliating her like this,” an insider told Us magazine. “Everyone just wants her to take care of herself and to be happy. But she won’t let go of Jamie.”  Foxx, 50, sparked breakup rumors earlier this month when he was spotted partying in Miami with multiple women, while Holmes, 39, was in Paris for Fashion Week. Foxx also was seen getting close to his ex-girlfriend Kristin Grannis on July 4 when they watched fireworks together in Malibu. On top of that, the “Ray” actor was hit with allegations that he got rough with a woman during a sexual encounter in Las Vegas 2002 and tried to force her to have oral sex with him.  While TMZ reported that Foxx won’t face charges in that case because the statute of limitations had run out, Holmes is reportedly unhappy with his other behavior around women, Us magazine reported.  Nonetheless, Holmes is not ready to give up on the relationship, because she’s “absolutely smitten” with him, the insider told Us.  Page Six reported that Holmes was heard declaring her love for the “Django Unchained” actor after she boarded a flight to Paris. Suri, her 12-year-old daughter with Cruise, was with her, as was a friend and their nanny.  “Katie was FaceTiming Jamie after they boarded,” a source told Page Six. “She said she loves him and asked if he wanted ‘cookies from Paris.'”  Holmes and Foxx reportedly began dating in 2013 after Holmes divorced Cruise in 2012, but Holmes and Foxx went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret. That’s because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  They still have never publicly confirmed that they are a couple, though they did the next best thing in September 2017 by being photographed together, walking on a beach in Malibu holding hands.  Then again, when RadarOnline reported in late June that the couple had split, Holmes representative went on the record to call the story “100 percent untrue.” Many outlets took the on-the-record denial as an official confirmation that there is — or was — a relationship.  Us magazine said there are other challenges to the relationship, notably the fact that Holmes lives in New York City and Foxx is based in Los Angeles. But they see each other “more than people would think,” a source said.  The key to Foxx’s hold on Holmes is that he’s “mesmerizing,” “entertaining” and can always make her laugh, the source told Us. So, somehow it works for her — for now.  “She has fun with him when they are together,” the source said. “It’s a relationship that works for her.”",real

18696,"Oh, Prince George!  Kate Middleton and Prince William's 4-year-old son was his usual rowdy self at the Trooping the Colour parade on Saturday, but this time, he may have been out-sassed by his cousin.

It's confirmed: Foxx and Holmes, who are believed to have been dating since 2013, finally appeared in public together as they enjoyed a day at the beach on Monday  Radar Online reported that Katie 'agreed not to publicly date another man for five years in exchange for £3.8million in child support and a £3.8million payment for herself' [writes The Sun].

19698,"Jennifer Garner is proof that comfort and style aren't mutually exclusive. The mom of three has made cozy-yet-fashionable her signature look, as evident by the perfect ensemble she just pulled together at Los Angeles International Airport on Wed. afternoon. Jennifer Garner's airport style is about to serve as some serious inspiration for your next getaway (reminder: holiday season is on the horizon).  Choosing a travel outfit that's comfortable but not sloppy is no easy feat — take it from celebrities, whose airport appearances are broadcasted constantly. This holiday season, you'll want to dress cozy enough for the cabin, but still stylish enough to face friends and family confidently on arrival — and for that, you'll need an ensemble like Garner's.  On Weds., the 46-year-old dressed for LAX like a pro in a chocolate-colored knit turtleneck and a wool-and-cashmere cropped gray coat. Garner's double-breasted Khaite Carlotta jacket was a stylish warm layer for perpetually frigid plane rides and loose fitting enough to move around in. The Camping actor paired her basic skinny jeans with minimalistic black-leather loafers, which she wore earlier in the day sans socks.  Garner carried a mid-sized black-leather tote, the ideal carry-on, and wore her hair half-up, a style that keeps wispy flyaways out of your face but still looks refined.  SMXRF/Star Max/GC Images  Get The Look  Other celebrities like to elevate their travel looks a little more. Priyanka Chopra, for instance, recently wore high-waisted baby-blue cargo pants tucked into white Fendi cowboy boots to the airport, and Tiffany Haddish sported a geometric jumper with a leather jacket and furry slipper-style flats at LAX the same day. Garner, however, proves the classic jeans-and-a-top formula should never be underestimated.  Garner's airport style is just a facet of her go-to off-duty looks — the actor lives in her favorite Mother brand jeans and basic knit sweaters. The secret to Garner's LAX ensemble rests on her layering of polished basics. The actor could have sported a sloppy sweatshirt but reached for a sleek-yet-moveable turtleneck instead.  When putting together your in-flight outfits this season, opt for a favorite pair of denim and sophisticated knits that you can also move around in. Layer an elegant coat over it for both function and fashion. No need to wear heels on the plane, but a classic mule or comfortable fall bootie certainly trumps a tennis shoe.

A representative for American Airlines told Page Six on Monday that Meyers and his wife, Mara Lane, were engaged in a “domestic dispute” while flying from Miami to Los Angeles with their 1-year-old son. American Airlines requested that law enforcement meet the flight, which landed close to 8 p.m. PT, given the “nature of the argument.”  Los Angeles airport police also told us that Meyers, 40, “took a drag or was about to take a drag of a vape pen,” but the flight crew told him it was against regulations and he put it away.  Meyers and his wife’s verbal altercation didn’t have any physical component, so it was determined that no crime had been committed. As a result, he and his wife were released.  Meyers has sought treatment for alcoholism in the past, most recently having relapsed in September 2017 following his wife’s miscarriage.  A rep for Meyers didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.",real

3262,"In a statement on Tuesday, his spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said: “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. He will not be available for further comments, as he is taking the time to focus on his family, on getting counseling and rebuilding his life.”  Even in an industry in which sexual harassment has long persisted, Mr. Weinstein stands out, according to the actresses and current and former employees of the film companies he ran, Miramax and the Weinstein Company. He had an elaborate system reliant on the cooperation of others: Assistants often booked the meetings, arranged the hotel rooms and sometimes even delivered the talent, then disappeared, the actresses and employees recounted. They described how some of Mr. Weinstein’s executives and assistants then found them agents and jobs or hushed actresses who were upset.  His alleged behavior became something of a Hollywood open secret: When the comedian Seth MacFarlane announced Oscar nominees in 2013, he joked, “Congratulations, you five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein.” The audience laughed. According to a 2015 memo by a former Weinstein Company executive that The Times previously disclosed, the misconduct continued.  More established actresses were fearful of speaking out because they had work; less established ones were scared because they did not. “This is Harvey Weinstein,” Katherine Kendall, who appeared in the film “Swingers” and television roles, remembers telling herself after an encounter in which she said Mr. Weinstein undressed and chased her around a living room. Telling others meant “I’ll never work again and no one is going to care or believe me,” she reasoned at the time, she said in a recent interview.",fake

4547,"It’s been more than two years since Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton got divorced, but the two reportedly still hate each other. The exes appeared to have moved on with their current partners Anderson East and Gwen Stefani, but they still get on each other’s nerves. An insider told OK! that the “Vice” hitmaker can’t stand seeing her ex-husband and his girlfriend flaunt their romance. She despises seeing him look so happy with his sexy lover.  There is reportedly a lot of frustration between Miranda and Blake, and they are now letting it show. A source claimed that the 34-year-old singer has accused the 41-year-old country superstar of using his The Voice co-star to make her jealous. He allegedly retaliated by telling her that Gwen has everything that she does not. Hollywood Life reportedly reached out to Lambert and Shelton’s reps regarding this controversy, but no word from them yet.  The former power couple of country music has avoided talking about their divorce and instead, use their music to express their feelings. Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton both claim that they are happy with their current partners Anderson East and Gwen Stefani. However, they still continue to throw shade at each other, which means that they haven’t totally moved on.  Featured image credit: Rick Diamond Getty Images  During her concert in South Carolina, Miranda performed her hit song “Little Red Wagon” but changed the lyric “I live in Oklahoma” to “I got the hell out of Oklahoma.” That’s where she used to live with her ex-husband. The next day, Blake reportedly retaliated by doing a cover of “All My Exes Live in Texas” by George Strait at the Crash My Playa festival, and this could be a diss to his ex-wife who hails from Texas.  Miranda Lambert may not have intentionally slammed Blake Shelton when she changed a line from her song because she expressed how much she wanted to get over her divorce.

4017,"Duke of Sussex  Duke of Sussex (more)  Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex,[fn 2] (Henry Charles Albert David;[fn 1] 15 September 1984)[1] is a member of the British royal family. He is the younger son of Charles, Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales and is sixth in the line of succession to the British throne.  Harry was educated at Wetherby School, Ludgrove School, and Eton College. He spent parts of his gap year in Australia and Lesotho. He then underwent officer training at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He was commissioned as a cornet (second lieutenant) into the Blues and Royals, serving temporarily with his brother Prince William, and he completed his training as a troop leader. In 2007–08, he served for over ten weeks in Helmand, Afghanistan, but was pulled out after an Australian magazine revealed his presence there. He returned to Afghanistan for a 20-week deployment in 2012–13 with the Army Air Corps. He left the army in June 2015.  Harry launched the Invictus Games in 2014 and remains patron of its foundation. He also gives patronage to several other organisations, including the HALO Trust, the London Marathon Charitable Trust, and Walking With The Wounded.[2] On 19 May 2018, he married American actress Meghan Markle. Hours before the wedding, his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II made him Duke of Sussex. The couple's son, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, was born on 6 May 2019. In January 2020, the couple announced their intention to step back as senior members of the royal family and split their time between the UK and North America.  Early life  Harry was born in the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, on 15 September 1984 at 4:20 pm as the second child of Charles, Prince of Wales—heir apparent to Queen Elizabeth II—and Diana, Princess of Wales.[3][4][fn 3] He was baptised with the names Henry Charles Albert David, on 21 December 1984, at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.[fn 4]  His parents announced their second son's name would officially be Prince Henry Charles Albert David, but that he would be known as Harry to his family and friends. As the prince grew up, he was referred to by Kensington Palace, and therefore the Press and the public at large, as Prince Harry.[10] As a son of the Prince of Wales, he was called Prince Henry of Wales. Diana wanted Harry and his older brother, Prince William, to have a broader range of experiences and a better understanding of ordinary life than previous royal children. She took them to venues that ranged from Walt Disney World and McDonald's to AIDS clinics and homeless shelters.[11] Harry began accompanying his parents on official visits at an early age; his first overseas tour was with his parents to Italy in 1985.[12]  Harry's parents divorced in 1996. His mother died in a car crash in Paris the following year. Harry and William were staying with their father at Balmoral at the time, and the Prince of Wales told his sons about their mother's death.[13] At his mother's funeral, Harry, then 12, accompanied his father, brother, paternal grandfather, and maternal uncle, Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer, in walking behind the funeral cortège from Kensington Palace to Westminster Abbey.[14] In a 2017 interview with The Daily Telegraph, the prince acknowledged that he sought counselling after two years of ""total chaos"" while struggling to come to terms with the death of his mother.[15]  Education  Like his father and brother, Harry was educated at independent schools. He started at London's Jane Mynors' nursery school and the pre-preparatory Wetherby School.[16] Following this, he attended Ludgrove School in Berkshire. After passing the entrance exams, he was admitted to Eton College. The decision to place Harry at Eton went against the past practice of the Mountbatten-Windsors to send children to Gordonstoun, which Harry's grandfather, father, two uncles, and two cousins had attended. It did, however, see Harry follow in the Spencer family footsteps, as both Diana's father and brother attended Eton.[11]  In June 2003, Harry completed his education at Eton with two A-Levels,[17] achieving a grade B in art and D in geography, having decided to drop history of art after AS level.[18] He excelled in sports, particularly polo and rugby union.[19] One of Harry's former teachers, Sarah Forsyth, has asserted that Harry was a ""weak student"" and that staff at Eton conspired to help him cheat on examinations.[20][21] Both Eton and Harry denied the claims.[20][22] While a tribunal made no ruling on the cheating claim, it ""accepted the prince had received help in preparing his A-level 'expressive' project, which he needed to pass to secure his place at Sandhurst.""[20][23]  After school, Harry took a gap year, during which he spent time in Australia working (as his father had done in his youth) on a cattle station, and participating in the Young England vs Young Australia Polo Test match.[24] He also travelled to Lesotho, where he worked with orphaned children and produced the documentary film The Forgotten Kingdom.[11]  Military career  Sandhurst; Blues and Royals; deployment to Afghanistan  Officer Cadet Wales (standing to attention next to the horse) on parade at Sandhurst , 21 June 2005  Harry entered the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst on 8 May 2005, where he was known as Officer Cadet Wales, and joined the Alamein Company.[25] In April 2006, Harry completed his officer training and was commissioned as a Cornet (second lieutenant) in the Blues and Royals, a regiment of the Household Cavalry in the British Army. On 13 April 2008, when he reached two years' seniority, Harry was promoted to lieutenant.[26]  In 2006, it was announced that Harry's unit was scheduled to be deployed in Iraq the following year. A public debate ensued as to whether he should serve there. Defence Secretary John Reid said that he should be allowed to serve on the front line of battle zones. Harry agreed saying, ""If they said 'no, you can't go front line' then I wouldn't drag my sorry ass through Sandhurst and I wouldn't be where I am now.""[27] The Ministry of Defence and Clarence House made a joint announcement on 22 February 2007 that Harry would be deployed with his regiment to Iraq, as part of the 1st Mechanised Brigade of the 3rd Mechanised Division – a move supported by Harry, who had stated that he would leave the army if he was told to remain in safety while his regiment went to war.[28] He said: ""There's no way I'm going to put myself through Sandhurst and then sit on my arse back home while my boys are out fighting for their country.""[29]  The head of the British army at the time, General Sir Richard Dannatt, said on 30 April 2007 that he had personally decided that Harry would serve with his unit in Iraq,[30] and Harry was scheduled for deployment in May or June 2007, to patrol the Maysan Governorate.[31] By 16 May, however, Dannatt announced that Harry would not serve in Iraq;[32] concerns included Harry being a high-value target (as several threats by various groups had already been made against him) and the dangers the soldiers around him would face should any attempt be made on his life or if he was captured. Clarence House made public Harry's disappointment with the decision, though he said he would abide by it.[33]  In early June 2007, it was reported that Harry had arrived in Canada to train alongside soldiers of the Canadian Forces and British Army, at CFB Suffield, near Medicine Hat, Alberta. It was said that this was in preparation for a tour of duty in Afghanistan, where Canadian and British forces were participating in the NATO-led Afghan War.[34]  This was confirmed in February of the following year, when the British Ministry of Defence revealed that Harry had been secretly deployed as a Forward Air Controller to Helmand Province in Afghanistan for the previous ten weeks.[35][36] The revelation came after the media – notably, German newspaper Bild and Australian magazine New Idea[37][38] – breached the blackout placed over the information by the Canadian and British authorities.[39] It was later reported that Harry helped Gurkha troops repel an attack from Taliban insurgents,[40] and performed patrol duty in hostile areas while in Afghanistan.[41][42][43]  His tour made Harry the first member of the British royal family to serve in a war zone since his uncle, Prince Andrew, who flew helicopters during the Falklands War. For his service, his aunt, Princess Anne, presented Harry with an Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan at the Combermere Barracks in May 2008.[44]  Army Air Corps and second deployment to Afghanistan  In October 2008, it was announced that Harry was to follow his brother, father and uncle in learning to fly military helicopters. After passing the initial aptitude test, he was to undertake a month-long course; if he passed that, he would begin full flight training in early 2009.[45]  Harry had to pass his flying assessment at the Army Air Corps Base (AAC), Middle Wallop, the result of which would determine whether he would continue on to train as a pilot of the Apache, Lynx, or Gazelle helicopter.[46] Having reached the requisite standard, Harry attended the Defence Helicopter Flying School at RAF Shawbury, where he joined his brother.[47]  Prince Charles presented him with his flying brevet (wings) on 7 May 2010 at a ceremony at the Army Air Corps Base (AAC), Middle Wallop. Harry had let it be known he intended to fly Apache attack helicopters if he was successful in passing the rigorous Apache training course. This would allow him to see active military service again on the frontline in Afghanistan.[48]  On 10 March 2011, it was revealed that Harry had passed his Apache flying test and he was awarded his Apache Flying Badge on 14 April 2011.[49] There was speculation he would return to Afghanistan before the withdrawal in 2015. On 16 April 2011, it was announced that Harry had been promoted to captain.[50]  In June 2011, Clarence House announced that on completion of his training conversion course to use Apache helicopters in the war arena, Harry would be available for deployment, including in current operations in Afghanistan, as an Apache helicopter pilot. The final decision rested with the Ministry of Defence's senior commanders, including principally the Chief of the Defence Staff in consultation with the wishes of Harry, the Prince of Wales, and the Queen.[51] In October, he was transferred to a US military base in California to complete his helicopter gunship training.[52] This final phase included live-fire training and ""environmental and judgment training"" at naval and air force facilities in California and Arizona. Most of those completing the two-month Apache training were deployed to the front lines in Afghanistan.[53] In the same month, it was reported that Harry was said to be a natural pilot who was top of his class in the extensive training he had undertaken at the Naval Air Facility, El Centro, California;[54] while training in Southern California, he spent time in San Diego.[55] In November 2011, Harry returned to England. He went to Wattisham Airfield in Suffolk, in the east of England, to complete his training to fly Apache helicopters.[56]  On 7 September 2012, Harry arrived at Camp Bastion in southern Afghanistan as part of the 100-strong 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment, Army Air Corps,[57] to begin a four-month combat tour as a co-pilot and gunner for an Apache helicopter.[58] On 10 September, within days of arriving in Afghanistan, it was reported that the Taliban had threatened his life. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid spoke to Reuters and was quoted as saying: ""We are using all our strength to get rid of him, either by killing or kidnapping."" He added, ""We have informed our commanders in Helmand to do whatever they can to eliminate him.""[59]  On 21 January 2013, it was announced that Harry was returning from a 20-week deployment in Afghanistan,[60] where he served as an Apache co-pilot/gunner. On 8 July 2013, the Ministry of Defence announced that Harry had successfully qualified as an Apache aircraft commander.[61] Harry compared operating the Apache's weapons systems in Afghanistan to playing video games.[62][63]  HQ London District and Invictus Games  On 17 January 2014, the Ministry of Defence announced that Harry had completed his attachment to 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, and would take up a staff officer role, SO3 (Defence Engagement), in HQ London District. His responsibilities would include helping to co-ordinate significant projects and commemorative events involving the Army in London. He was based at Horse Guards in central London.[64]  On 6 March 2014, Harry launched Invictus Games, a Paralympic-style sporting event for injured servicemen and women, which was held on 10–14 September 2014.[65] Harry met British hopefuls for the Invictus Games at Tedworth House in Wiltshire for the start of the selection process on 29 April 2014.[66] On 15 May 2014, Harry attended a ticket sale launch for Invictus Games at BT Tower, from where he tweeted on the Invictus Games' official Twitter account as the president of the Games.[67] To promote the Games, he was interviewed by BBC Radio 2's Chris Evans along with two Invictus Games hopefuls. He said: ""This (Invictus Games) is basically my full-time job at the moment, making sure that we pull this off."" The show aired on 31 July 2014.[68] Harry later wrote an article in The Sunday Times about his experiences in Afghanistan: how they had inspired him to help injured personnel and how, after the trip to the Warrior Games, he had vowed to create the Invictus Games.[69] Harry and officials attended the British Armed Forces Team announcement for Invictus Games at Potters Field Park in August 2014.[70][71] As president of the Invictus Games, he attended all events related to the Games from 8 to 14 September 2014.[72]  In January 2015, it was reported that Harry would take a new role in supporting wounded service personnel by working alongside members of the London District's Personal Recovery Unit for the MOD's Defence Recovery Capability scheme to ensure that wounded personnel have adequate recovery plans. The palace confirmed weeks later[73] that the scheme was established in partnership with Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion.[74]  In late January 2015, Harry visited The Battle Back Centre[75] set up by the Royal British Legion, and Fisher House UK at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham. A partnership between Help for Heroes, the Fisher House Foundation and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham (QEHB) Charity created the Centre.[76] Fisher House Foundation is one of the Invictus Games' sponsors.[77]  In February and March 2015, Harry visited Phoenix House in Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire, a recovery centre run by Help for Heroes. He also visited Merville Barracks in Colchester, where Chavasse VC House Personnel Recovery Centre is located, run by Help for Heroes in partnership with the Ministry of Defence and Royal British Legion.[78]  Secondment to Australian Defence Force and end of active service  On 17 March 2015, Kensington Palace announced that Harry would leave the Armed Forces in June.[79] Before then, he would spend four weeks throughout April and May at army barracks in Darwin, Perth and Sydney whilst seconded to the Australian Defence Force (ADF). After leaving the Army, while considering his future, he would return to work in a voluntary capacity with the Ministry of Defence, supporting Case Officers in the Ministry's Recovery Capability Programme. He would be working with both those who administer and receive physical and mental care within the London District area.[80][81]  On 6 April 2015, Harry reported for duty to Australia's Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin at the Royal Military College, Duntroon in Canberra, Australia.[82] Harry flew to Darwin later that day to begin his month-long secondment to the ADF's 1st Brigade. His visit included detachments to NORFORCE as well as to an aviation unit.[83] While in Perth, he trained with Special Air Service Regiment (SASR), participating in the SASR selection course, including a fitness test and a physical training session with SASR selection candidates. He also joined SASR members in Perth for live-fire shooting exercises with numerous Special Forces weapons at a variety of ranges. Harry completed an insertion training exercise using a rigid-hull inflatable boat. In Sydney, he undertook urban operations training with the 2nd Commando Regiment. Training activities included remotely detonating an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) and rappelling from a building. He also spent time flying over Sydney as co-pilot of an Army Black Hawk helicopter and participated in counter-terrorism training in Sydney Harbour with Royal Australian Navy clearance divers.[84]  Harry's attachment with the ADF ended on 8 May 2015,[85] and on 19 June 2015 he resigned his short service commission.[86][87]  Post-active service  Since leaving active service with the army, Harry has been closely involved with the armed forces through the Invictus Games, honorary military appointments and other official engagements. On 19 December 2017, he succeeded his grandfather Prince Philip as the Captain General of the Royal Marines.[88] In May 2018, he was promoted to the substantive ranks of Lieutenant Commander of the Royal Navy, Major of the British Army and Squadron Leader of the Royal Air Force.[89]  Personal life  Harry (right) talking to an opponent during a volleyball competition between American and British injured soldiers, 13 May 2013  Harry enjoys playing many sports, including competitive polo, skiing, and motocross.[24] He is a supporter of Arsenal Football Club.[90] Harry is also a keen Rugby football fan and supported England's bid to host rugby union's 2015 Rugby World Cup,[91] and presented the trophy at rugby league's 2019 Challenge Cup finals.[92]  In his youth Harry earned a reputation for being rebellious, leading the tabloid press to label him a ""wild child"".[93] At age 17 he was seen smoking cannabis, drinking underage with friends, and clashing physically with paparazzi outside nightclubs.[93] He was photographed at Highgrove House at a ""Colonial and Native"" themed costume party wearing a Nazi German Afrika Korps uniform with a swastika armband.[94] He later issued a public statement apologising for his behaviour.[95]  In January 2009, the British tabloid, the News of the World, revealed a video made by Harry three years earlier in which he referred to a Pakistani fellow officer cadet as ""our little Paki friend"" and called a soldier wearing a cloth on his head a ""raghead"". These terms were described by Leader of the Opposition David Cameron as ""unacceptable"", and by The Daily Telegraph as ""racist"". A British Muslim youth organisation called Harry a ""thug"".[97] Clarence House immediately issued an apology from Harry, who stated that no malice was intended in his remarks.[98] Former British MP and Royal Marine, Rod Richards, said that such nicknames were common amongst military comrades, stating ""in the Armed Forces people often used to call me Taffy. Others were called Yankie, Oz or Kiwi or whatever. I consider Paki as an abbreviation for Pakistani. I don't think on this occasion it was intended to be offensive.""[99]  While on holiday in Las Vegas in August 2012, Harry and an unknown young woman were photographed naked in a Wynn Las Vegas hotel room, reportedly during a game of strip billiards. The pictures were leaked by American celebrity website TMZ on 21 August 2012,[100] and reported worldwide by mainstream media on 22 August 2012.[101][102][103] The photographs were shown by the American media, but British media were reluctant to publish them.[104] Royal aides suggested Clarence House would contact the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) if British publications used the pictures.[105] St James's Palace confirmed that Harry was in the photographs, saying that he was essentially a victim whose privacy had been invaded and contacted the PCC upon hearing that a number of British newspapers were considering publishing the photographs.[106] On 24 August 2012, The Sun newspaper published the photographs.[107]  Polls conducted in the United Kingdom in November 2012 showed Harry to be the third-most popular member of the royal family, after William and the Queen.[108]  Bachelorhood  Chelsy Davy, the daughter of Zimbabwean, South Africa-based businessman Charles Davy, was referred to as Harry's girlfriend in an interview conducted for his 21st birthday, and Harry said he ""would love to tell everyone how amazing she is but once I start talking about that, I have left myself open.... There is truth and there is lies and unfortunately I cannot get the truth across.""[109] Davy, who is a businesswoman and lawyer, was present when Harry received his Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan[44] and also attended his graduation ceremony when he received his flying wings from his father.[48] In early 2009, it was reported the pair had parted ways after a relationship that had lasted for five years.[110]  In May 2012, Harry was introduced to Cressida Bonas, an actress and model who is granddaughter of Edward Curzon, 6th Earl Howe, by his cousin Princess Eugenie.[111] On 30 April 2014, it was reported that the couple had parted amicably.[112]  Marriage and fatherhood  Prince Harry and Markle attending church at Sandringham on Christmas Day, 2017  On 8 November 2016, Kensington Palace confirmed that Harry was ""a few months"" into a relationship with American actress Meghan Markle, in a statement from the prince asking for the ""abuse and harassment"" of Markle and her family to end.[113] In September 2017, they made their first public appearance at an official royal engagement, the opening ceremonies of the Invictus Games in Toronto.[114][115]  On 27 November 2017, Clarence House and Kensington Palace announced that Harry and Markle were engaged.[116] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Meghan Markle becoming a mixed-race[117] royal.[118][119][120][121] The couple married at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 19 May 2018.[122][123]  The Duke and Duchess initially lived at Nottingham Cottage in London, on the grounds of Kensington Palace.[124] The couple later moved to the more than two-centuries-old Frogmore Cottage in the Home Park of Windsor Castle.[125][126] The Crown Estate refurbished the cottage at a cost of £2.4 million, paid out of the Sovereign Grant, with the couple picking up expenses beyond restoration and ordinary maintenance.[127][128] Their office was moved to Buckingham Palace.[129]  On 6 May 2019, the couple's first child Archie Mountbatten-Windsor was born, who is seventh in line to the throne.[130]  Wealth and inheritance  At the time of the announcement of Harry and Meghan's decision to ""step back"" as senior members of the royal family in 2020, 95% of the couple's income derived from the £2.3 million given to them annually by Harry's father, Charles, as part of his income from the Duchy of Cornwall.[131]  Harry and his brother William inherited the ""bulk"" of the £12.9 million left by their mother on their respective 30th birthdays, a figure that had grown since her 1997 death to £10 million each in 2014.[132][133] In 2002 The Times reported that Harry would also share with his brother a payment of £4.9 million from trust funds established by their great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, on their respective 21st birthdays and would share a payment of £8 million upon their respective 40th birthdays.[134] Harry's personal wealth was estimated at £30 million by The Daily Telegraph in 2020.[131]  In 2014 Harry and William inherited their mother's wedding dress along with many other of her personal possessions including dresses, diamond tiaras, jewels, letters, and paintings. The brothers also received the original lyrics and score of ""Candle in the Wind"" by Bernie Taupin and Elton John as performed by John at Diana's funeral.[133]  Public life  On 6 January 2009, the Queen granted Harry and William their own royal household. Previously, William and Harry's affairs had been handled by their father's office at Clarence House in central London. The new household released a statement announcing they had established their own office at nearby St James's Palace to look after their public, military and charitable activities.[135]  In March 2012, Harry led an official visit to Belize as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.[136] He continued to the Bahamas and Jamaica, where the Prime Minister, Portia Simpson-Miller, was considering initiating a process of turning Jamaica into a republic.[137] He then visited Brazil to attend the GREAT Campaign.[138]  Between 9 and 15 May 2013, he made an official visit to the United States. The tour promoted the rehabilitation of injured American and UK troops, publicised his own charities and supported British interests. It included engagements in Washington, DC, Colorado, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. He met survivors of Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey.[139][140] In October 2013, he undertook his first official tour of Australia, attending the International Fleet Review at Sydney Harbour.[141] He also paid a visit to the Australian SAS HQ in Perth.[142]  In May 2014, he visited Estonia and Italy. In Estonia, he visited Freedom Square in the capital Tallinn to honour fallen Estonian soldiers. He also attended a reception at the Estonian Parliament[143] and a NATO military exercise.[144] In Italy, Harry attended commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the Monte Cassino battles, in which Polish, Commonwealth and British troops fought.[145][146] On 6 November 2014, he opened the Field of Remembrance at Westminster Abbey,[147] a task usually performed by Prince Philip.[148]  Before reporting for duty to the Australian Defence Force (ADF), Harry visited the Australian War Memorial in Canberra on 6 April 2015.[82] On 7 May 2015, he made a farewell walkabout at the Sydney Opera House and visited Macquarie University Hospital.[149][150] On 24–25 April 2015, he joined his father in Turkey to attend commemorations of the centenary of the Gallipoli Campaign.[151]  From 30 November to 3 December 2015, he made an official visit to South Africa.[152] He visited Cape Town, where he presented the insignia of the Order of the Companions of Honour to the Archbishop on behalf of the Queen.[153]  He visited Nepal 19–23 March 2016.[154] He stayed until the end of March 2016 to help rebuild a secondary school with Team Rubicon UK, and visited a Hydropower Project in Central Nepal.[155]  In April 2018, he was appointed Commonwealth youth ambassador.[156] Also that month, Harry became a patron of Walk of America, a campaign which brings together a number of veterans who will take part in a 1,000-mile expedition across the US in mid-2018.[157][158] The Prince was appointed the president of the Queen's Commonwealth Trust, which focuses on projects involving children and welfare of prisoners, in April.[159] Also in April 2018, Harry was selected as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World by Time magazine.[160]  In April 2019, it was announced that he was working on a documentary series about mental health together with Oprah Winfrey, which is set to air in 2020 on Apple TV+. He will serve as co-creator and executive producer for the series.[161]  The Sussexes' discontent with their public roles and media scrutiny grew in 2019.[162] In May 2019, Splash News issued a formal apology to Harry and his wife for sending photographers to their Cotswolds residence, which put their privacy at risk. The agency also agreed to pay a ""substantial"" sum of damages and legal costs associated with the case.[163][164] At the end of their tour of Southern African countries in September–October 2019, Harry issued a statement mentioning that his wife was ""one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press"".[165] Later in October, it was announced that Harry had sued The Sun, the Daily Mirror and the now-defunct News of the World ""in relation to alleged phone-hacking"".[166] On 30 January 2020, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) sided with the Mail on Sunday over a dispute between the Duke and the newspaper regarding an Instagram photo involving Harry in which, according to the newspaper, elephants were in fact ""tranquilized"" and ""tethered"" during a relocating process. The IPSO rejected Harry's claim that the paper's description was ""inaccurate"" or ""misleading"".[167]  In January 2020, the Duke and Duchess announced that they were stepping back from their role as senior members of the royal family, and would balance their time between the United Kingdom and North America.[168] The couple also said that they would seek financial independence while continuing to support their charities and the Queen.[169] In the same month, the couple's lawyers issued a legal warning to the press after paparazzi photographs were published in the media.[170] It was later confirmed that security for the Duke and Duchess during their stay in Canada was provided for on an ""as needed basis"" by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police until they formally stepped down on 31 March, ""in keeping with their change in status"".[171] In March 2020, Harry attended the opening of the Silverstone Experience in Silverstone Circuit together with racing driver Lewis Hamilton. Harry's appearance at the museum was his final solo engagement as a senior royal before he and his wife officially stepped down on 31 March.[172]  Civic and philanthropic work  Sentebale  At the age of 21, Harry was appointed a Counsellor of State and began his duties in that capacity. In 2006, he was in Lesotho to visit Mants'ase Children's Home near Mohale's Hoek, which he first toured in 2004. Along with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, he launched Sentebale: The Princes' Fund for Lesotho, a charity to aid children orphaned by HIV/AIDS. He has granted his patronage to organisations including WellChild, Dolen Cymru, and MapAction.[173]  On 26 November 2015, as patron of Sentebale, Harry travelled to Lesotho to attend the opening of the Mamohato Children's Centre.[174] Two days later Harry played the Sentebale Royal Salute Polo Cup, at Val de Vie Estate in Cape Town, South Africa, fundraising for Sentebale.[175]  Sport  Sport has been a way that Harry has helped charities and other organisations. This has included training as a Rugby Development Officer for the Rugby Football Union in 2004 and coaching students in schools to encourage them to learn the sport. He is the patron of the Rugby Football League, Rugby League's governing body in England.[176] Like his brother and father, he has participated in polo matches to raise money for charitable causes.[24][177]  Prince Harry discusses the topic of post-traumatic stress during the 2016 Invictus Games Symposium on Invisible Wounds with former US president George W. Bush , two veterans and moderator Jeremy Schaap  In 2012, together with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Harry launched Coach Core. The program was set up following the 2012 Olympics and provides apprenticeship opportunities for people who desire to pursue a career as a professional coach.[178] As patron of Walk of Britain, he walked with the team on 30 September[179] and 20 October 2015.[180] On 28 October 2015, he carried out one day of engagements in the US. He launched the Invictus Games Orlando 2016 with First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden at Fort Belvoir.[181] He later attended an Invictus Games board meeting and a reception to celebrate the launch at the British Ambassador's Residence.[182]  In June 2019, the Duke was present at the launch of Made by Sport, a charity coalition set to raise money to boost sport in disadvantaged communities. In his statement, he lent his support to the charity by arguing that its role in bringing sport into the life of disadvantaged people would save ""hundreds of millions of pounds"" towards treating the issues among young people.[183] In February 2020, Harry recorded a new version of the song ""Unbroken"" with Jon Bon Jovi. The new version features backing vocals from members of the Invictus Choir.[184] The song was released on 27 March 2020, the proceeds of which were donated to the Invictus Games Foundation.[185]  The Royal Foundation  In September 2009, William and Harry set up The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry to enable the princes to take forward their charitable ambitions.[186][187][188] In June 2019, it was announced that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would split from the charity and establish their own charity foundation by the end of 2019. The couples will reportedly collaborate on mutual projects, such as the mental health initiative Heads Together.[189][190] In July 2019, Harry and Meghan's new charity was registered in England and Wales under the title ""Sussex Royal The Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex"".[191] However, on 21 February 2020 it was confirmed that ""Sussex Royal"" would not be used as a brand name for the couple following their withdrawal from public life.[192] In April 2020, responding to inquiries from The Telegraph, the couple confirmed their new foundation would be called ""Archewell"".[193] The name stems from the Greek word ""arche"", which means ""source of action""; it is the same word that inspired the name of the couple's son, Archie.[193]  In April 2020, Harry launched a new initiative named HeadFIT, a platform designed to provide mental support for members of the armed forces. The initiative was developed mutually by the Royal Foundation's Heads Together campaign, the Ministry of Defence, and King's College London.[194]  HIV/AIDS  To raise awareness for HIV testing, Harry took a test live on the royal family Facebook page on 14 July 2016.[195] He later attended the 21st International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa, on 21 July 2016.[196][197] On World Aids Day, Harry and Rihanna helped publicise HIV testing by taking the test themselves.[198] Since 2016, Harry has been working with Terrence Higgins Trust to raise awareness about HIV and sexual health.[199][200]  In July 2018, the Elton John AIDS Foundation announced that the Duke of Sussex and British singer Elton John were about to launch a global coalition called MenStar that would focus ""on treating HIV infections in men"".[201][202] During his trip to Angola in 2019, the Duke visited the Born Free to Shine project in Luanda, an initiative by First Lady Ana Dias Lourenço which aims to ""prevent HIV transmission from mothers to babies"" through education, medical testing and treatment. He also met HIV+ youth and teenagers during his visit.[203] In November 2019, to mark the National HIV Testing Week, the Duke interviewed HIV+ Rugby player Gareth Thomas on behalf of the Terrence Higgins Trust.[204]  Natural environment and climate change  On 27 December 2017, Harry was officially appointed the new president of African Parks, a conservation NGO.[205] He previously spent three weeks in Malawi with African Parks where he joined a team of volunteers and professionals to carry out one of the largest elephant translocations in history. The effort to repopulate areas decimated due to poaching and habitat loss moved 500 elephants from Liwonde and Majete National Parks to Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve.[206]  In March 2019 Prince Harry gave a speech at WE Day UK, an annual event organised by We Charity to inspire young people to become more active towards global social and environmental change.[207] He discussed mental health, climate change and the importance of social participation.[208] Harry attended a Google summit in August 2019 and gave a speech on the importance of tackling climate change in Sicily. He explained that he and Meghan plan to have no more than 2 children to help sustain the environment.[209] Later that month, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were criticised by environmental campaigners for using private jets regularly when taking their personal trips abroad, which would leave more carbon footprint per person compared to commercial planes. The criticism was in line with the reactions the royal family faced in June 2019, after it was revealed that they ""had doubled [their] carbon footprint from business travel.""[210][211] In September, the Duke launched Travalyst during his visit to the Netherlands after two years of development. The initiative is set ""to encourage sustainable practices in the travel industry"" and ""tackle climate change and environmental damage"", in collaboration with a number of companies.[212]  During his visit to the Luengue-Luiana National Park in Angola in September 2019, the Duke unveiled an initiative by the Queen's Commonwealth Canopy to help with protecting ""an ancient elephant migration route"" by proving safe passage for them in the forest.[213]  Titles, styles, honours and arms  The Duke of Sussex's Monogram  Titles and styles  1984–2018: His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales  Prince Henry of Wales 2018–present: His Royal Highness The Duke of Sussex In Scotland : The Earl of Dumbarton [214]  The Duke of Sussex  On the morning of his wedding[215] he was granted by the Queen the Dukedom of Sussex, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, first conferred in 1801 upon Prince Augustus Frederick, the sixth son of King George III, referring to the English county. At the same time he was also granted two subsidiary titles, both also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom: Earl of Dumbarton, a recreated ancient title formerly in the Peerage of Scotland, and Baron Kilkeel, a new title providing the Prince with a nominal territorial link to Northern Ireland, one of the four constituent countries of the United Kingdom. He is usually known as Prince Harry.  Before his marriage, Harry used Wales as his surname for military purposes and was known as Captain Harry Wales in such contexts.[216]  On 4 June 2015, as part of the 2015 Special Honours, Harry was knighted by his grandmother, the Queen, for ""services to the sovereign"", being appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO).[217]  On 18 January 2020, Buckingham Palace announced that, following their decision to step back from royal duties, from 31 March 2020 Harry and his wife have agreed not to use their Royal Highness styles, but as a British prince he will not be stripped of his style and titles.[218][219]  Military ranks  Honours  Orders  Medals  The prince wearing his medals, 2013  Foreign honours  Appointments  Fellowships  Honorary military appointments  On 18 January 2020, it was announced that he was ""required to step back from Royal duties, including official military appointments"" in ""Spring of 2020"".[229]  Humanitarian awards  Harry's charitable efforts have been recognised three times by the international community. In December 2010, the German charity Ein Herz für Kinder (""A Heart for Children"") awarded him the Golden Heart Award, in recognition of his ""charitable and humanitarian efforts"".[234][235] On 7 May 2012, the Atlantic Council awarded him its Distinguished Humanitarian Leadership Award.[236] In August 2018, the Royal Canadian Legion granted him the 2018 Founders Award for his role in founding the Invictus Games.[237]  Arms  Ancestry  Agnatically, Harry is a member of the House of Glücksburg, a cadet branch of the House of Oldenburg, one of Europe's oldest royal houses. Harry's paternal grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, issued letters patent on 8 February 1960 declaring his father to be a member of the House of Windsor.[240]  Ancestors on Harry's father's side include most of the royal families of Europe,[240] and on his mother's side, the Earls Spencer.[241]  See also",fake
6237,"Taylor Swift is currently dating actor Joe Alwyn. The couple have done a very good job of keeping their relationship shrouded in mystery. But here's a timeline with as much information as we could find, starting with the latest update. It's been tricky, mind you...  29 April 2020  Incredibly private Joe Alwyn shares a little insight into self isolation with Taylor Swift, posting three Instagram Stories of one of her beloved cats.  The 29-year-old actor posted three photos of the blue-eyed cat named Benjamin Button: in one he lay in a paper shopping bag, before hiding in a cardboard box and under a rug. Taylor also has two other cats; Olivia Benson and Meredith Grey named after TV characters.  Instagram Stories/Joe Alwyn  3 May 2016:  So where Joe and Tay met isn't 100% clear, which makes the start date to this timeline a tad tricky but, bear with us.  It's May, 2016 and both attend the Met Gala. I know what you're thinking, this link may seem tenuous given that the whole of Hollywood goes BUT Swift's new song 'Dress' - where she sings: 'Flashback to when you met me/ Your buzz cut/ And my hair bleached' -has provided some fans with the theory that the 2016 event could be significant.  Getty Images  A-ha! At the gala, Joe's hair is certainly shorter and Taylor rocks a bleached blonde bob...    However, this Met Gala is also seemingly full of Taylor-related events as a video of her and (soon to be boyfriend) Tom Hiddleston having a dance-off to Beyonce's Crazy in Love does the rounds on the internet.  Just a month later, she announces she has broken up with boyfriend of a year Calvin Harris and weeks later she's pictured kissing Tom Hiddleston. 'Hiddleswift', as they become to be known, break up in September, 2016.  12 October 2016:  Taylor and a whole load of squad members (Is the squad still a thing?) including Lorde, Cara Delevingne, Dakota Johnson and Martha Hunt attend a secret Kings of Leon concert in New York City. It's widely reported that Joe was also there and this is the place where the couple meet.  Taylor and Dakota Johnson in NYC on October 12, 2016 Getty Images  12 November 2016:  Taylor is papped going to watch a film with her mother and two of the Haim sisters Este and Alana in Los Angeles. And what film is this? Only Joe Alwyn's film Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk.  Coincidence orrrrr?  16 May 2017:  Unfortunately, we can't fill you in on what specifically happened over the six months between November 2016 and May 2017 because the couple were so darn good at hiding their relationship.  In May, the story of their relationship finally breaks. The Sun reports that the pair have been dating in secret for months (seems about right) and that Taylor is ""besotted"" with him.  They add that she's been spending lots of time in London with him, using wigs, scarves and hats as a disguise.  ""Taylor and Joe are the real deal, this is a very serious relationship,"" a source tells the newspaper. ""...Taylor has flown in via private jets and her security has made it a military-like mission to prevent her from being seen.""  1 June 2017:  As well as Taylor's Mission Impossible-style visits to the UK, Joe also flies to see Taylor in New York, reports E! News.  ""Taylor and Joe have really tried to be on lockdown and have spent most of their time together in private locations where they could get to know each other without the pressure of a public relationship and people making judgement calls,"" a source tells the outlet.  2 June 2017:  E! News covers the story a day later, reporting that Joe has finally met... the squad.  Taylor Swift and said ’squad’ at the 2015 VMAs Getty Images  Apparently, Selena Gomez and Gigi Hadid, as well as other ""close friends"", had the pleasure of meeting and getting to know their pals' new beau.  5 June 2017:  Taylor and Joe are pictured together for the first time in a paparazzi shot. The two are seen enjoying coffee on a balcony in Nashville, Tennessee and Taylor is smiling. Cute! It's reported that Joe is there to meet the parents. Dun dun dunnnn.  As well as this, reports that Taylor is house-hunting in London - the city where none other than bloomin' Joe lives - also do the rounds.  26 July 2017:  Taylor and Joe are photographed again, however, this time they're really trying not to be. Pictures in the Mail Online show the couple wearing hoodies and keeping their eyes to the ground as they leave the singer's New York City apartment.  5 September 2017:  Taylor is back with new music and everyone is freaking out trying to guess who and what all the songs are about. After all, she's had a fairly eventful couple of years since her last album.  One song '...Ready for It?' has fans divided over whether it's about Joe or her former love interest Harry Styles. But then... according to Buzzfeed, Taylor reportedly likes a Tumblr post breaking down the lyrics, with all signs pointing to them being about Joe.  21 September 2017:  The secret transatlantic visits show no slowing down and they've reportedly been made easier by Taylor's famous mates.  According to The Sun, Cara Delevingne hosted the couple at her house in west London so that they could continue to keep the whole thing on the DL while visiting Joe's family and friends.  Taylor and Cara in NYC in September 2016 Getty Images  ""She's trying to keep a low profile with Joe and staying with Cara has let her do that,"" a source told the tabloid. ""... They can even walk Cara's dog round the local park without anyone batting an eyelid.""  20 October 2017:  Another song from Taylor's forthcoming album Reputation drops and it's called 'Gorgeous'.  According to fans, Taylor told them the song was about Joe during one of her secret listening sessions.  This content is imported from Twitter. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  Taylor told fans at the secret sessions that #Gorgeous is about her boyfriend Joe pic.twitter.com/4mxHSz9neL — Taylor Swift News (@TSwiftNZ) October 20, 2017  Lyrics include: ""You should take it as a compliment / That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk / You should think about he consequence / Of your magnetic field being a little too strong /And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us.""  Firstly, Joe is British and Taylor is American which could explain the whole making fun of the way you talk thing. Secondly, her two previous boyfriends have been in their 30s and therefore older than Joe.  26 October 2017:  Taylor's BFF Ed Sheeran pipes up, telling a radio station he thinks Joe is a ""good dude"".  Taylor and Ed at the 2016 Grammy awards Getty Images  Giving the seal of approval, the 'Shape of You' singer tells Capital London's Breakfast Show: ""He's really nice. Really, really friendly, really good dude"".  3 November 2017:  The fourth song from Reputation drops and this time it's 'Call It What You Want' which fans think seems to include a mix of references about both the Kimye feud and Joe.  Here are the lyrics which might be about Joe:  ""My baby's fly like a jet stream/ High above the whole scene"" - potentially referencing that Joe is not as famous as some of Swift's previous love interests.  10 November 2017:  Taylor's 15-track album is released in full, proving plenty more lyrics for us to try and dissect. Among the many fan theories pointing to lines about Joe, a couple are:  'Don't Blame Me': ""I've been breaking hearts a long time, and toying with them older guys just to play things for me to use / Don't blame me, your love made me crazy / My drug is my baby / I'll be using for the rest of my life""  The fact that Taylor seems to talk about the future in the last line indicates she's singing about a current relationship, i.e. her and Joe.

'Delicate': ""My reputation's never been worse, so you must like me for me / Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you / Oh damn, never seen that colour blue.""  It's fair to say Taylor's public reputation took a bash during the time she met Joe, which she could be hinting at when she describes how the mysterious subject of the song was into her regardless.  He also has very blue eyes, we might add.    6 April 2018:  Taylor is reportedly keen to buy a £30m house in north London's Crouch End, so she can ""set down roots"" near where Joe and his family live.  A source told The Sun: “Taylor loves the UK and how she can live a relatively normal life without being disturbed,"" the source said. “Setting down roots is something she’s thought long and hard about. She’s set aside £30million ($42million) to find the house of her dreams, which she hopes to one day settle down in with Joe if their relationship continues to grow.""  29 September 2018:  Taylor and Joe are spotted hand-in-hand heading towards the singer's New York City apartment together.  Jackson Lee Getty Images  22 November 2018:  Would you believe it? Taylor is actually tagging Joe in a post on Instagram! It's all to promote his new movie The Favourite, which he stars in with Olivia Coleman, Emma Stone and Nicholas Hoult. Taylor calls the film ""phenomenal"" and tells her followers to go see it.  11 December 2018:  Taylor Swift managed to slip into the London premiere of Joe's move Mary Queen Of Scots, and no one noticed. Well, until Izuka Hoyle, who plays courtier Mary Seton, shared an Instagram Story of the pair chatting in the cinema's lobby, along with the caption, ""Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone"".  Instagram Stories  While fans are desperate for their first official red carpet moment for Joe and Taylor, a source told The Sun the singer didn't want to distract from her boyfriend's achievements.  ""Taylor didn't want to draw attention to herself because it was really Joe's night"", the insider commented. ""But she did want to support him and knew he would appreciate her being there, so she took steps to try and prevent anyone knowing she was there.  ""It worked in the dark of the cinema but by the time they made it to the party afterwards her cover was blown.""  6 January 2019:  A new year and yet Taylor and Joe still appear to be going strong. The two attended the Golden Globes, separately, of course and then hit up several after-parties following the show.  All eyes on Taylor at the 2019 InStyle and Warner Bros party Donato Sardella Getty Images  Taylor was spotted at the InStyle/Warner Bros party - where she posed on the red carpet - and then at Fox's and Netflix's soirees, as was Joe. At the Netflix afterparty, ""Taylor Swift, was the star of the party, sitting in a VIP area next to [Netflix CCO Ted] Sarandos. At one point, Sarandos approached Swift and her boyfriend Joe Alwyn to ask for a photo with the star. Swift obliged, but was quickly met with more and more photo requests from other attendees at the party. Security called for backup to her section to give her some privacy, but Swift and Alwyn left the event shortly after,"" per The Hollywood Reporter.  Joe at the FOX, FX And Hulu 2019 Golden Globe Awards After Party Phillip Faraone Getty Images  A reporter for Entertainment Tonight also told his Twitter followers how he'd witnessed ""Joe Alwyn give Taylor Swift a kiss at the Fox afterparty"". Cute!  17 January 2019:  Given that Joe is in every film under the sun at the start of 2019 (well, it feels like it, he has parts in The Favourite and Mary Queen of Scots) he conducts some interviews to promote these movies.    In one with Mr Porter, he objects to being labelled ""strangely private"" over his and Taylor's refusal to discuss their relationship. He tells the magazine he doesn't think he's had to ""fight for his privacy"" more than anyone else in the public eye and it seems like he's just of the opinion he doesn't have to share one of the more personal sides of his life with the rest of the world.  ""I don't think anyone you meet on the streets would just spill their guts out to you, therefore why should I?"" he says. ""And then that is defined as being 'strangely private'. Fine. But I don't think it is. I think it's normal.""  10 February 2019:  Taylor skipped the Grammys so she could support Joe at the BAFTAs, where his film, The Favourite, won like a million awards. Look how sweet they look together!  Getty Images  Getty Images  Plus, Taylor posted this sweet message on Instagram...  This content is imported from Instagram.

They were spotted at the Night Before party and the CAA bash as well as another event, with Perez Hilton claiming it was ""PDA all over the place"".  ""Taylor Swift hit up three parties with her boyfriend Joe Alwyn,"" Perez told Australian radio show KIIS FM's Kyle & Jackie O.  He added: ""They went to such great lengths in 2018 to every avoid being seen in public together. Now finally not only are they going to events and supporting each other. But PDA all over the place.  Joe at the 2019 Oscars Getty Images  24 February 2019:  While Joe Alwyn attended the Oscars alone, he was later joined by Taylor Swift at the Vanity Fair party. Other party goers went to great lengths to document the singer's presence, with one catching a lowkey moment of PDA between the pair on video. Adorable.  21 March 2019:  Despite it making it very very hard for fans to get updates on how their relationship is going, being secretive is apparently the key to making things work between Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn.  According to a source at People, ""Keeping it private from the beginning really helped their relationship. They were able to get to know each other in peace.""  Getty Images  While there are rumours going around that Joe is planning a proposal, Taylor is apparently just happy to be with him whatever happens. ""Taylor really got lucky to meet Joe, and she is the first one to say it,” a source said. “Joe really is one of a kind.”  The insider added that ""They have a very special relationship. Joe adores Taylor"", before commenting on the fact they're ""very compatible,"" ""respectful"" of each other’s careers, and ""so sweet"" together.  ALRIGHT GUYS. We get it. Anyone else feeling very very single right now?    17 July 2019:  Joe has been supporting Taylor during all this nasty Scooter Braun business.  A source told Hollywood Life, ""Taylor‘s loved ones have all rallied around her to support her through this battle, she is not alone in this fight. Her boyfriend Joe has been a total rock in all of this, he is very supportive of her taking a stand… he has got a strong backbone.""  The source added: ""Taylor has always been pretty fearless when it comes to speaking her truth but having such a solid and healthy relationship makes her feel that much stronger. What she is going through with Scooter is so challenging, but the good news is that her personal life is all smooth sailing. She is very grateful for that.""  12 August 2019:  Taylor fans think the singer is secretly engaged to Joe, after she shared some particularly telling lyrics from her new album with Vogue.  In the track, which they describe as both 'haunting' and 'romantic', Taylor sings, ""My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue. All’s well that ends well to end up with you.""  Something borrowed? Something blue? End up with you? Certainly sounds like a hint towards marriage, doesn't it? Well, Taylor's fans definitely think so, with many taking to Twitter to speculate about whether the singer just announced her engagement.  ""HOLD UP SOMETHING BORROWED SOMETHING BLUE? MS.SWIFT ARE YOU GONNA BE TAYLOR ALWYN?"" one fan wrote, while another added, ""I think Taylor Swift just told us she's engaged. That's it. That's the tweet.""  A third added, ""If Taylor Swift is secretly engaged to Joe Alwyn I’ll never be calm again.""  This content is imported from Twitter.

3553,"Bye, bye, Tristan Thompson. Khloé Kardashian doesn't need a man's help when it comes to raising her newborn baby, True Thompson. The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star gave birth to her daughter on April 12, just days after Tristan was exposed for cheating on her with multiple women throughout her pregnancy. Despite putting on a united front, a source told Life & Style, Koko was devastated and doesn't plan on staying with the NBA star.  ""She's in disbelief. It feels like a bad dream. She's trying to be strong for the baby, but it's not easy,"" the insider explained. ""She thought she was in a loving relationship and that this was forever."" When the 33-year-old got wind of the footage of Tristan making out with other girls, she was ""hysterical"" and ""felt completely humiliated and couldn't stop crying,"" the source said.  Literally hours later, Koko went into labor. ""Tristan ruined what should have been the happiest day of Khloé's life,"" the source continued. Now, because of the cheating scandal, Khloé thinks ""she can raise this baby alone.""  And she's not wrong there. The new mama is incredibly capable as she has taken care of all of her nieces and nephews plenty of times over the past eight years. Between Mason, 8, Penelope, 5, North, 4, Reign, 3, Saint, 2, Dream, 1, Chicago, three months, and Stormi, two months — Khloé has had her fair share of diaper duty to know what to expect with her own child.  However, a different source doesn't think Khloé will get rid of her serial cheater boyfriend for good. After all, she did allow him in the delivery room so soon following the scandal — not to mention the number of chances she gave Lamar Odom when she knew he was hooking up with other women.  ""She'll break up with Tristan for a while,"" the source revealed. ""But sadly, Khloé will probably take him back.""

354,"Joseph Kony is a Ugandan warlord and leader of The Lord’s Resistance Army, a cultish militant group that operates in central Africa. He has more than 60 wives and his alleged crimes include murder, kidnapping, rape and military enslavement of more than 30,000 children.  In 2005, he was indicted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity, but despite endless efforts by skilled military personnel, he has evaded capture and remains one of Africa’s most dangerous and wanted men.  So it came as a bit of a shock this weekend when we learned — thanks to documents leaked from within the ICC — that in 2012, Angelina Jolie, Oscar-winning film star, mother of many, thrice-married international humanitarian, United Nations special envoy and all-round sex bomb, had offered to come to the ICC’s rescue. Apparently, she had generously offered to hunt Kony down herself.  Kony has more than 60 wives and his alleged crimes include murder, kidnapping, rape and military enslavement of more than 30,000 children  Even more surprising, was that Luis Moreno Ocampo, the dashing Argentine ICC chief prosecutor cited at the time as one of the ‘100 Top Global Thinkers’, not only accepted Angie’s generous offer, but actually pinned his hopes on her succeeding where the ICC, with its £130 million-a-year budget and machine-gun toting Special Forces, had failed.  The plan was simple, though sadly for all Lara Croft: Tomb Raider enthusiasts, it involved no skin-tight Lycra, no bosoms jutting like torpedoes or automatic weapons strapped to Angie’s gleaming thighs. In fact, there were to be no guns at all.  Instead, Angie would be embedded with U.S. Special Forces close to Kony’s stronghold in northern Uganda and act as a honeytrap. And, as one leaked email sent by Moreno Ocampo explains, once settled in, she ‘has the idea to invite Kony to dinner and then arrest him’.  ‘Forget other celebrities, she is the one,’ Moreno Ocampo wrote excitedly in another email. ‘She loves to arrest Kony. She is ready. Probably Brad [Pitt, her third husband] will go also.’  The emails were found in 40,000 files obtained by the French investigative website Mediapart and shared with The Sunday Times’ Insight team. Not surprisingly, they have caused quite a stir.  Angie may be the world’s sexiest woman, but was it likely that, after eluding hundreds of highly trained military personnel, a war criminal and alleged mass murderer would let his guard down just for the chance of a dinner date?  Then again, men do have a habit of becoming a bit hot and bothered when face to face with Jolie’s pillowy lips, slender figure, entrancing décolletage and raging social conscience.  The leader of The Lords Resistance Army was indicted for war crimes including the military enslavement of children  When she first appeared at the Davos World Economic Forum in 2005, macroeconomics flew out of the window. Finance ministers apparently became pink and flustered and lost their train of thought. Media moguls were distracted and dreamy.  One senior executive said at the time: ‘No one could concentrate. She has an extraordinary effect...’  Former Foreign Secretary William Hague was famously entranced by Angie’s good works when they met at a film screening in 2011. The pair struck up an immediate friendship and have since worked on a joint mission to end war rape across the world. In 2015, he admitted he was stepping down at the election so he could continue his quest with Angie.  It goes without saying that beetle-browed Moreno Ocampo — a legal heavyweight and anti-corruption expert who had gained fame as assistant prosecutor in the infamous Trial of the Juntas — had a huge crush on Angie.  It began in 2009 when the actress attended the trial of Congo warlord Thomas Lubanga (his conviction for forcibly recruiting child soldiers was Moreno Ocampo’s sole successful prosecution in nine years as ICC chief prosecutor).  Angelina Jolie offered to come to the International Criminal Court’s rescue by hunting down Kony herself  Pleased as punch — the Argentine liked nothing more than the presence of a celebrity to add fairy dust to his daily grind — in 2010 he wrote to Jolie, via her assistant, asking her to become his advisor.  ‘I see a role for her helping us to understand and build bridges with the humanitarian campus and with citizens concerned from all over the world,’ he said.  Nothing came of it. Perhaps Jolie was too busy that year starring in The Tourist with Johnny Depp, establishing the Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Foundation to support conservation work in the Kalahari, opening a school in Afghanistan, or looking after her ever-expanding family.  Who knows? But then in 2011, deep joy, she popped up again. She’d written and produced a film about the Bosnian War, In The Land Of Blood And Honey, and wanted to know if he liked it.  Liked it?! He loved it, and despite supposedly having one of the most demanding jobs in international humanitarian law and being in demand as a consultant to the World Bank and UN, found time to watch it over (and over) again.  Unlike some reviewers who considered the dialogue clunky and awkward, or one critic who called it a ‘messy, unnatural war porno’, he was utterly entranced and gushed in an email to her about how he felt it ‘was comparable to Shakespeare’ with a plot ‘so strong I am still recovering’.  Former Foreign Secretary William Hague was famously entranced by Angie’s good works when they met at a film screening in 2011 and has fought to stop rape being used as a weapon with the star  Several days later, having watched it again, he was back in touch, love-bombing her with praise: ‘I am in LA and watched the movie again (4th time)... you are a genius. You did exactly what you said: a love story showing the war horrors. Xx Luis.’  Angie was thrilled.  ‘Louis, I wish you could see the smile on my face. You represent with your work all that I value. I’m so happy the film speaks to you.’  Who cared if she’d spelled his name wrongly? Luis certainly did not.  Beneath his carefully trimmed beard, he was so chuffed that he instantly starting planning an important new humanitarian starring role for Ms Jolie: helping bring the evil Joseph Kony to trial.  Angie was immediately on board, going public in a 2012 video calling for Kony’s arrest. ‘He’s an extraordinarily horrible human being who, you know... his time has come and it’s lovely to see young people are raising up as well,’ she said.  And then, apparently, she came up with her cunning honeytrap idea to lure Kony to a dinner in the Central African Republic so he could be arrested.  It was dangerous work. Kony is the sort of man who cuts off people’s lips and noses and forces children to kill their parents and siblings with machetes.  Even by Jolie’s standards — she is the sort of woman who used to wear a vial of her second husband’s blood in a necklace and has never shied from doing the unexpected — the plan seemed deeply unadvisable.  But Moreno Ocampo was thrilled. He liaised with anti-Kony pressure group Invisible Children and the Special Forces trying to trap Kony, and reported back: ‘You can be embedded with the Special Forces chasing Kony. Can Brad go with you?  ‘It will be great to spend more time with the American troops,’ he wrote. ‘They are eager to get Kony, but after meeting you, they will do it.’  Angelina Jolie was prepared to lure Joseph Kony, a man who eluded hundreds of highly trained military personnel, to dinner  Perhaps he meant she would inspire them to succeed where everyone before had failed. Perhaps he felt she really would be able to lure Kony into a trap.  Whatever, it seemed to be all systems go. ‘Brad is being supportive,’ replied Ang. ‘Let’s discuss logistics. Much love Xxx.’  And then? Nothing. Angie went quiet. Maybe the trip went ahead, but more likely not — there is no further mention in the leaked files and Kony is still at large.  Undaunted however, Moreno Ocampo was back emailing Angie the following month. This time, he was asking for advice.  After a sensitive three-year enquiry, he had decided the ICC couldn’t investigate war crimes in the Palestinian territories, but did not know how best to announce his decision. ‘The issue is how to present it to the normal people...’ he emailed her. ‘So if you have any ideas, just let me know.  ‘I am attaching the decision I will take. It is confidential. Please don’t share it before Tuesday.’  Angie’s response? ‘I suggest read your statement but consider not opening the floor to questions.’  Sadly, for Moreno Ocampo, this was to be Angie’s last email. She was edging away from his increasingly enthusiastic contact. He couldn’t even tempt her back with proposals for a charity education project... though he kept trying.  ‘Dear Angie, I hope you are well. I miss you.’ No answer.  Angie wasn’t the only Hollywood star Ocampo tried — and failed — to recruit. But he made even less headway with actors George Clooney and Sean Penn.  Clooney refused his request for help flying spy satellites over Libya ‘to put pressure on Gaddafi’s generals’. And when Ocampo invited Penn to a New York hotel to discuss a potential investigation into the Palestinian conflict, he received a flip response.  ‘While you make the decision on Palestine, I’m embroiled in a decision weather [sic] or not to get a steam in the hotel spa,’ wrote Penn.  Meanwhile, he still wasn’t ready to give up, and when he read reports that Angie was unwell, emailed her assistant in a panic, saying: ‘I realise how much I love her.’ And finally, an answer. From the assistant, though — mortifyingly curt and notifying him that Angie had changed her private email address.  And that was that. Shortly afterwards, his ICC tenure came to an end and he left to pursue other avenues in law, human rights and international conflict. Oh yes, and last year, reportedly approached glamorous humanitarian lawyer Amal Clooney (George’s wife) for help with a case.  Meanwhile, Angie has continued with her tireless humanitarian work.  And, tragically, evil Kony remains at large, unlikely now ever to accept a dinner invitation to Angeline Jolie, however tempted he might be.",fake

3274,"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. They were finally ready to announce to the world that they were a couple.  Since then, Holmes and Foxx have been spotted together more openly at various events, including sitting next to each other at Clive Davis’s Pre-Grammy Awards Gala in January, People reported. Holmes also turned up at Foxx’s 50th birthday party in Los Angeles in mid-December.  Holmes’ romantic history has long been marked by intense, high-profile highs and devastating lows, especially surrounding her high-octane courtship and marriage to Cruise.  Holmes and Cruise got engaged in 2005 after just seven weeks of dating. Cruise famously gushed about his love for Holmes by jumping on Oprah Winfrey’s TV show couch. They became parents to daughter Suri in 2006 and married in a lavish Church of Scientology wedding in an Italian castle.  Holmes initiated the divorce from Cruise because she reportedly became concerned about raising Suri as a Scientologist. Numerous investigative reports over the years have shown that the Church exercises an enormous amount of control over the lives of members, including over how parents raise their children. Critics regard Scientology as a mind-controlling cult.  What appears certain about Holmes’ life is that she’s been a devoted, protective mother to Suri, doing the best she can to raise her on her own.  Numerous reports describe Suri as an intelligent, kind-hearted girl, with Holmes herself opening up about her daughter’s philanthropic heart in a 2015 interview with Today.  “My little one is very, very generous and very sensitive,” Holmes said, according to People.  Over the years, their mother-daughter bond has been documented in photos at events, as in when Suri and Holmes appeared on the Madison Square Garden stage together in December to introduce Taylor Swift at the Jingle Ball concert.  Holmes also has shared images of their sometimes playful, friendly bond in a series of photos she has posted to Instagram.",fake
13473,"Source: Stock-Asso/Shutterstock  [Article revised on 27 April 2020.]  Most of us seem to be hankering after romantic love. But few of us realize that, far from being timeless and universal, romantic love is a modern construct that emerged in tandem with the novel.  In Madame Bovary (1856), itself a novel, Gustave Flaubert tells us that Emma Bovary only found out about romantic love through ""the refuse of old lending libraries"".  ...were all about love and lovers, damsels in distress swooning in lodges, postillions slaughtered all along the road, horses ridden to death on every page, gloomy forests, troubles of the heart, vows, sobs, tears, kisses, rowing-boats in the moonlight, nightingales in the grove, gentlemen brave as lions and gentle as lambs, too virtuous to be true, invariably well-dressed, and weeping like fountains.  But there are, of course, many other ways to love. By preoccupying ourselves with romantic love, we risk neglecting other types of love that are more stable or readily available, and that may, especially in the longer term, prove more healing and fulfilling.  The Ancient Greeks had several words for love, enabling them to distinguish more clearly between the different types.  I’m now going to guide you through seven types of love, each with a name from Ancient Greek.  These seven types of love are loosely based on classical readings, especially of Plato and Aristotle, and on JA Lee’s 1973 book, Colors of Love.  1. Eros  Eros is sexual or passionate love, and most akin to the modern construct of romantic love. In Greek myth, it is a form of madness brought about by one of Cupid’s arrows. The arrow breaches us and we ""fall"" in love, as did Paris with Helen, leading to the downfall of Troy and much of the assembled Greek army.  In modern times, eros has been amalgamated with the broader life force, something akin to Schopenhauer’s will, a fundamentally blind process of striving for survival and reproduction. Eros has also been contrasted with Logos, or Reason, and Cupid painted as a blindfolded child.  2. Philia  The hallmark of philia, or , is shared goodwill. Aristotle believed that a person can bear goodwill to another for one of three reasons: that he is useful; that he is pleasant; and above all, that he is good, that is, rational and virtuous. Friendships founded on goodness are associated not only with mutual benefit but also with companionship, dependability, and trust.  For Plato, the best kind of friendship is that which lovers have for each other. It is a philia born out of eros, and that in turn feeds back into eros to strengthen and develop it, transforming it from a lust for possession into a shared desire for a higher level of understanding of the self, the other, and the world. In short, philia transforms eros from a lust for possession into an impulse for .  Real friends seek together to live truer, fuller lives by relating to each other authentically and teaching each other about the limitations of their beliefs and the defects in their character, which are a far greater source of error than mere rational confusion: they are, in effect, each other’s therapist—and in that much it helps to find a friend with some degree of , articulacy, and insight, both to change and to be changed.  3. Storge  Storge [""store-jay""], or familial love, is a kind of philia pertaining to the love between parents and their children. It differs from most philia in that it tends, especially with younger children, to be unilateral or asymmetrical. More broadly, storge is the fondness born out of familiarity or dependency. Compared to eros and philia, it is much less contingent on our personal qualities.  People in the early stages of a often expect unconditional storge, but find only the need and dependency of eros, and, if they are lucky, the maturity and fertility of philia. Given enough time, eros tends to mutate into storge.  4. Agape  Agape [""aga-pay""] is universal love, such as the love for strangers, nature, or God. Unlike storge, it does not depend on filiation or familiarity. Also called charity by Christian thinkers, agape can be said to encompass the modern concept of altruism, as defined as unselfish concern for the welfare of others.  Recent studies link altruism with a number of benefits. In the short-term, an act leaves us with a euphoric feeling, the so-called ""helper’s high"". In the longer term, altruism has been associated with better mental and physical health, and even greater longevity.  At a social level, altruism serves as a signal of cooperative intentions, and also of resource availability and so of mating or partnering potential. It also opens up a debt account, encouraging beneficiaries to reciprocate with gifts and favours that may be of much greater value to us than those with which we felt able to part.  More generally, altruism, or agape, helps to build and maintain the psychological, social, and, indeed, environmental fabric that shields, sustains, and enriches us. Given the increasing and division in our society, and the state of our planet, we could all do with quite a bit more agape.  5. Ludus  Ludus is playful or uncommitted love. It can involve activities such as teasing and dancing, or more overt , seducing, and conjugating. The focus is on fun, and sometimes also on conquest, with no strings attached.  Ludus relationships are casual, undemanding, and uncomplicated, but, for all that, can be very long-lasting. Ludus works best when both parties are mature and self-sufficient. Problems arise when one party mistakes ludus for eros, whereas ludus is, in fact, much more compatible with philia.  6. Pragma  Pragma is a kind of practical love founded on reason or duty and one’s longer-term interests. Sexual takes a back seat in favour of personal qualities and compatibilities, shared , and ""making it work"".  In the days of arranged marriages, pragma must have been very common. Although unfashionable, and at a polar opposite of romantic love, it remains widespread, most visibly in certain high-profile celebrity and political pairings.  Many relationships that start off as eros or ludus end up as various combinations of storge and pragma. Pragma may seem opposed to ludus, but the two can co-exist, with the one providing a counterpoint to the other. In the best of cases, the partners in the pragma relationship agree to turn a blind eye—or even a sympathetic eye, as with Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre, or Vita Sackville-West and Harold Nicholson.  7. Philautia  Philautia, finally, is self-love, which can be healthy or unhealthy. Unhealthy self-love is akin to hubris. In Ancient Greece, people could be accused of hubris if they placed themselves above the gods, or, like certain modern politicians, above the greater good. Many believed that hubris led to destruction, or nemesis.  Today, ""hubris"" has come to mean an inflated sense of one’s status, abilities, or accomplishments, especially when accompanied by haughtiness or arrogance. Because it does not accord with the truth, hubris promotes injustice, conflict, and enmity.  Healthy self-love, on the other hand, is akin to , which is our cognitive and, above all, emotional appraisal of our own worth. More than that, it is the matrix through which we think, feel, and act, and reflects on our relation to ourselves, to others, and to the world.  In everyday language, ""self-esteem"" and "" "" tend to be used interchangeably. However, self-esteem and self-confidence do not always go hand in hand. In particular, it is possible to be highly self-confident and yet to have profoundly low self-esteem, as is the case, for example, with many performers and celebrities.  People with healthy self-esteem do not need to prop themselves up with externals such as income, status, or notoriety, or lean on crutches such as , drugs, or . They are able to invest themselves completely in projects and people because they do not failure or rejection. Of course, they suffer hurt and disappointment, but their setbacks neither damage nor diminish them. Owing to their , they are open to growth experiences and relationships, tolerant of risk, quick to joy and delight, and accepting and of themselves and others.  In closing, there is, of course, a kind of porosity between the seven types of love, which keep on seeping and passing into one another.  For Plato, love aims at beautiful and good things, because the possession of beautiful and good things is called , and happiness is an end-in-itself.  Of all good and beautiful things, the best, most beautiful, and most dependable is truth or , which is why Plato called love not a god but a philosopher.

For one moment, Edward Cullen and Bella Swan was once again a couple and all was right in the world for Twilight fans. Ex-lovers Robert Pattinson, 28, and Kristen Stewart, 32, attended Lily-Rose Depp’s 19th birthday party on June 1. However, don’t expect their love to rise from the grave. “There’s no chance of any kind of romantic reconciliation for Rob and Kristen,” a source close to Rob EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “That ship has well and truly sailed, and way too much has passed between them to ever reunite in that way. Plus, Kristen is really happy with Stella [Maxwell], they have an amazing relationship.”  While there’s no chance that RPatz and KStew will date again, it’s not all bad, as the source tells HollywoodLife.com that Rob thinks it’s “great” that they’ve “finally got to a place where they can be friendly when they see each other in public. Rob would love to see more of Kristen, he still cares for her deep down, and probably always will—she was his first real love.” As for Kristen, she “feels a little awkward when she sees Rob,” because she still “carries a lot of guilt” from how their romance ended (you know, what with her cheating on him with Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders.) However, the source says that Rob has repeatedly told her that “everything is good between them, and he doesn’t harbor any bad feelings towards her.”  Too bad, Twilight fans. Bella’s not getting back with Edward – or Jacob, for that matter. This should come as no surprises, as the two didn’t really seem to be that enamored with each other at Lily-Rose’s birthday party, as a source from the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles – where the bash was held – EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com that they had “very cordial conversations, but it was minimal at best.” Oh, there was no drama – but there was no real chemistry either. Oh well.  Prior to the birthday bash, Robert and Kristen had a “low-key meet-up” in February 2018. Both Twilight stars were at a bar/restaurant in Los Angeles’ Silver Lake neighborhood. Eagle-eyed fans tweeted their excitement, hoping that they could “maybe start over again …but this time it means forever.” Sadly for these fans, the only way they can see Bella and Edward back together is in the pages of Stephenie Meyer’s books.",fake

TMZ's cameraperson also asked if Fatone thought Timberlake would bring Janet Jackson out during his performance as a nod to their controversial wardrobe malfunction incident at Super Bowl XXXVIII.  While Fatone couldn't confirm or deny a Jackson appearance, he did say, ""He's not that kind of person. He's not controversial like that.""

There will reportedly be ""beefed up"" security at his school, St. Thomas's Battersea, and more officers will accompany him and his grandmother, Carole Middleton (Kate's mom), during their outings together.  Two weeks ago, an alleged supporter of the Islamic State group went on trial in London, accused of encouraging attacks on the four-year-old prince. Prosecutors said Husnain Rashid—a 32-year-old former mosque teacher in northwest England—provided an ""e-toolkit for terrorism"" and encouraged attacks on a range of targets, including ""injecting poison into supermarket ice creams and targeting Prince George at his first school.""  The Guardian reports that one of Rashid's posts included a photo of George, his school, and the message, ""Even the royal family will not be left alone."" Last week, after previously saying he did nothing wrong, Rashid admitted to a number of terror offenses, including encouraging terrorism, according to CNN.  Getty Images  Prince George—the eldest child of Prince William and Kate Middleton, and third in line for the throne—was recently seen at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal wedding on May 19, where he served as a page boy.

4225,"Like many an actor before him, Johnny Depp believes he has been swindled in the Hollywood accounting shell game — by his own business managers and lawyers. In a lawsuit filed today, the Pirates Of The Caribbean star is going after The Management Group for more than $25 million in a jury-seeking suit alleging fraud and several other claims.  “As a result of years of gross mismanagement and sometimes outright fraud, Mr. Depp lost tens of millions of dollars and has been forced to dispose of significant assets to pay for TMG’s self-dealing and gross misconduct,” reads the 52-page complaint (read it here) filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by the actor and fellow Plaintiff Edward L. White as trustees of the Mooh Investment Trust.  The lawsuit alleges 11 complaints ranging from fraud to breach of contract to professional negligence. It claims TMG paid itself more than $28 million in contingency fees without a written agreement; failed to file or pay his taxes on time, resulting in more than $5.6 million in fees and penalties on his federal returns; and “loaning” nearly $10 million to third parties without Depp’s authorization or proper documentation.  “In essence, TMG treated Mr. Depp’s income as their own, available to either TMG or third parties to draw upon as desired,” read the complaint filed by attorneys at Los Angeles-based Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLC.  “TMG’s gross mismanagement and fraud remained undetected as TMG borrowed millions of dollars to survive from movie-to-movie,” add the filing.  “It was only recently, when Mr. Depp terminated TMG and hired new business management and accounting services, when Mr. Depp learned the gravity of his financial losses and some, but surely not all, of the underlying facts,” the complain states bluntly, also adding that the management firm is seeking foreclosure on Depp’s primary home through a loan the actor says came from TMG’s own self-dealing.  In addition to the more than $25 million sought in compensatory damages, the suit asks for a temporary restraining order and permanent injunction enjoining the Defendants from proceeding with the foreclosure on the home.  Depp, recently in the courts for his high-profile divorce from Amber Heard last summer, is plenty busy. He recently shot Open Road’s cop drama LAbyrinth, joined 20th Century Fox’s Murder On The Orient Express, and will co-star in Warner Bros’ follow-up to Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them.

14399,"Princess Eugenie of York and her now-husband Jack Brooksbank, the U.K. ambassador for George Clooney and Rande Gerber's tequila brand, Casamigos, were together for about seven years before tying the knot. But they kept much of their relationship out of the public eye. Here's what you need to know about newlyweds Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's love story.  They first met in Verbier, Switzerland.  Tim Graham Getty Images  The happy couple first met in 2010, at Verbier, a Swiss holiday resort and ski area, when Princess Eugenie was 20 and Brooksbank was 24, according to the BBC. Verbier is a popular holiday destination for the royals, and Eugenie had been vacationing there for years with her mother, the Duchess of York, and her sister, Princess Beatrice. Eugenie's parents, the divorced Duke and Duchess of York, eventually bought a chalet there in 2015.  Jack and Eugenie are actually distantly related.  It was recently revealed that they are distant cousins, much like Eugenie's grandmother Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip.  The duo attended their first Royal Ascot together in 2011.  Getty Images  In one of their first appearances as a couple, Brooksbank attended the annual horse race with Eugenie in 2011, soon after they began dating. However, Kate Middleton reportedly wasn't invited to Ascot until her 2011 marriage to Eugenie's cousin, Prince William. This is probably due to the fact that Eugenie is not a working royal—and thus has fewer rules to follow. This is also why Princess Eugenie is one of the only members of the British family to have an Instagram account.  They were long-distance while Eugenie lived in New York.  Getty Images  In 2013, Eugenie left London for New York, where she worked for online auction house Paddle8. Later that year, Brooksbank spoke to the Daily Mail in his first interview, explaining how the couple was handling the separation.""We spend a lot of time on Skype,"" he said. ""It’s great. We are still very much together.""  Eugenie moved back to London in 2015.  Getty Images  Eugenie moved back to London in 2015 and the couple began spending more time together. In 2016, Eugenie shared what their home life was like with Harper's Bazaar. ""When I'm with Jack, we watch The Walking Dead, which we're obsessed with,"" she said. ""Maybe Game of Thrones is our next thing. I don't watch reality shows, but I love cooking programs.""  In that same interview, Eugenie shared that her boyfriend and dog have the same name, which she says was a ""total accident!""  The next year, they marked a milestone in their relationship.  In September 2016, the couple joined the Queen and other members of the royal family for a weekend stay at Balmoral, the Queen's Scottish retreat, fueling engagement rumors. Eugenie's cousin, Prince Harry, hosted a shooting party at the castle to celebrate his 32nd birthday, with an insider telling The Daily Express, ""You could call this weekend a rite of passage for Jack. There is no way he would be invited to stay with the Queen unless he was being welcomed into the royal fold and the bosom of the family.""  They attended Pippa Middleton's wedding together.  Getty Images  In May 2017, Eugenie and Brooksbank attended the nuptials of Pippa Middleton and James Matthews.

18839,"HIP-HOP Watch Cardi B Hilariously Crash Jerry Seinfeld's 'Between Two Ferns' Interview With Zach Galifianakis  Zach Galifianakis returned with a new episode of his Funny or Die faux talk show Between Two Ferns on Thursday (June 14) and called on Jerry Seinfeld and Cardi B for a hilarious six-minute interview, in which Galiafinakis took aim at Seinfeld and showed hip-hop's golden child (and her unborn child) a whole lot of love.  Galifianakis begins to throw jabs at Seinfeld from the very beginning, when he expresses his disappointment in having the comedian on the show, especially after previously nabbing interviews with Hillary Clinton and President Obama. Galifianakis purposely mixes up Jerry's last name, even going as far as to write that the Seinfeld star was only funny from 1993 to 1997. The Hangover actor quips that the show Seinfeld has ""been a real launching pad for whites"" and calls Seinfeld's Netflix series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee ""lazy, car-based non-comedy.""  A little after the halfway mark, Galifianakis introduces his next and ""better"" guest, Cardi B, who takes the spotlight away from Seinfeld for the remainder of the interview. Galifianakis gifts Cardi with a gift for her baby, telling the rapper, ""You are special, but the most important thing is that you're relevant.""  Watch the hilarious interview below:",real

But when he got shirtless for his new movie Bad Times At The El Royale, his co-star Dakota Johnson found herself unable to contain her laughter.  The 29-year-old told Extra: 'It made me giggle so much. It was such a serious scene, and he’s so ridiculous-looking. He’s, like, wiggling his crazy body around.'  To tell the truth: When Chris Hemsworth got shirtless for his new movie Bad Times At The El Royale, his co-star Dakota Johnson found herself unable to contain her laughter  Chris, who rose to fame as the musclebound Norse god Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, plays a cult chieftain in the 1969-set new movie.  The thriller also stars Dakota and Jon Hamm and follows seven strangers converging at a Lake Tahoe hotel and facing their old demons.  Lewis Pullman, son of the actor Bill Pullman, joins an impressive cast that includes Tony-winner Cynthia Erivo and Oscar-winner Jeff Bridges.  Hunk: Dakota told Extra : 'It made me giggle so much,' adding: 'It was such a serious scene, and he’s so ridiculous-looking,' and quipping: 'He’s, like, wiggling his crazy body around'  Dakota, who in real life is the daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith and the granddaughter of Tippi Hedren, is seen hatching a nefarious scheme in the trailer.  In her hotel room, she has bound Cailee Spaeny's character to a chair and gagged her - according to Entertainment Weekly, the two of them are sisters.  When a man's voice through her hotel room door asks her to allow him access, Dakota, gun in hand, drawls: 'Nah, I ain't gonna do that,' as Cailee sits tied up nearby.  Who's who: Chris, who rose to fame as the musclebound Norse god Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, plays a cult chieftain in the 1969-set new movie  Bad Times At The El Royale, out now, was written and directed by Drew Goddard, who had the same positions on The Cabin In The Woods and who wrote The Martian.  Dakota is reputedly dating Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, who was once married to Gwyneth Paltrow until they split in what Gwyneth called a 'conscious uncoupling.'  Rumors had been swirling recently that Dakota was pregnant by the father of two, who at the age of 41 is 12 years her senior.  Up to no good: Dakota, who in real life is the daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith and the granddaughter of Tippi Hedren, is seen hatching a nefarious scheme in the trailer  They began when photos emerged of a star-studded party at her home that featured pink and blue balloons such as those seen at a gender reveal bash.  'The only thing I'm pregnant with is a lot of really good ideas,' Dakota said on The Ellen DeGeneres Show this week, clarifying: 'But not any babies.'  She said of the party: 'It was my birthday, and there were balloons that happened to be pink and blue, and so then, I was pregnant?'",real

1788,"Justin Bieber told hundreds of people at a Bible study class in Los Angeles that Hollywood elites killed his unborn child and destroyed the relationship he had with the child’s mother, Selena Gomez, as a way of punishing him.  Since finding God last year, Bieber has become a regular at the Bible study class held at the Montage in Beverly Hills and on Wednesday he shared what he called “the worst moment in my life” with the congregation and explained why he had to retire from the music industry.  Telling churchgoers that he will “never go back” to the “evil music industry” until the “pedophiles and monsters at the top of the game are run out of town” and everything is “disinfected with bleach and sunshine,” Bieber explained how Hollywood elites tried to corrupt him.  “They tried so hard to corrupt me,” Bieber said, “because I reached a level they couldn’t control anymore.”  “They tried to destroy me with alcohol and when that didn’t work they tried with drugs – all different kinds. Then when that didn’t work they tried to destroy me with ambition.”  “I was interested at first,” Bieber acknowledged, before saying “but when I realized what the price of admission is in that world, I had to quit.”  “Selena and I were expecting. It was early days and we hadn’t told anyone. At the same time I was being courted by some really powerful people, the most powerful people in Hollywood.”  Describing a top-secret party attended by record industry executives, Bieber said he was shown into a back room where a group of men wearing masks were sitting around the edge of the room, drinking from cups. In the center of the room a dead child was sitting cross-legged, propped up against the back of a chair. It looked like a late-stage fetus and was completely drained of blood.  “The baby’s entire scalp wasn’t there. Its skull had been stripped down to the surface of the bone. Portions of the right side of its undeveloped little face had been torn away. You could see bite marks and bruises all over its tiny body.”  “They were wearing animal masks, sitting around drinking what they called ‘red wine.’ They offered me some. It was obvious that it was really important for them that I got involved.  “I literally gagged at this point. One of them boasted the baby had been alive for eight hours after they started cutting it and draining its blood.”  “When he described the pain the baby went through, he seemed pleased with himself.”  The horrific death described by Bieber to his congregation is called “exsanguination”, otherwise known as completely draining a person of blood. The practice is popular among drinkers of baby blood who consume what they call “red wine” in order to get high on the adrenaline, young hormones, and negative energy they believe is found in the blood of children.  They believe the more a child suffers before its death, the more “enriched” its blood will be upon harvest. Often the child is physically and sexually abused before it is killed in order to create the necessary trauma.  Bieber refused to drink the blood and that is when “everything started going wrong.”  “They threatened me. They said they knew Selena was pregnant. They asked if I wanted my baby to end up like the one in the center of the room.”  “This completely flipped me out and I lost my way for a long time. I went off the rails,” said Bieber, fighting back tears. “They murdered my unborn child. Me and Selena… we were driven apart by these people and the trauma.”  But years have passed since the traumatic episode and Bieber has vowed to protect her and become a family man. Acknowledging rumors that the pair are back together, Bieber even hinted he is set to become a family man.  “They won’t lay a hand on my family so help me God,” he said.  “There are truly evil forces at work in the world. God is real. Satan is real,” Bieber said, before exiting the stand.  These latest allegations from Justin Bieber add to the wave of accusations made by celebrities and musicians about the real nature of the music and entertainment industry elite. Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood have both gone on record exposing the pedophilia at the heart of Hollywood.  According to Elijah Wood, innocent young lives are destroyed to satisfy “people with parasitic interests” who “see you as their prey.” In an interview with the Sunday Times, Wood dropped a series of bombshells about the pedophiles that run the industry, noting that “Clearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organized.”  If you read the Washington Post or watch CNN, pedophilia is not a problem, and those who talk about it are tinfoil hat wearing kooks perpetuating ‘fake news.’ But more and more stars are coming forward with similar stories about the depraved Hollywood system.  In recent months Nicole Kidman, Mel Gibson and Lindsay Lohan have spoken out about pedophilia in Hollywood. Close friends of Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington claim the recently deceased pair were working on exposing the pedophile ring working at the heart of the music industry – and it cost them their lives.  Justin Bieber shocked his fans by cancelling his world tour and announcing that he needed some time away from the music industry. As more information comes to light, it appears he made the best possible decision.",fake
1209,"A REPORT claiming that super-secretive couple Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes were no longer an item was not true, a representative for Holmes said today.  Actress Katie, 39, was said to have called off their relationship after struggling with trust issues, according to reports circulating today.  But that report was shot down by her rep, in a rare acknowledgment that the pair are actually an item.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, a representative for Holmes, told PEOPLE.  The couple only went public with their relationship in September last year but were first linked back in August 2013.  Radar Online reported that Dawson’s Creek star Katie called it quits with Jamie after reports he had been dating other women during their time together.  A source is said to have told Radar Online: “Katie just couldn’t get over her trust issues.”  The pair had insisted they were just good friends following Katie’s divorce from Tom Cruise.  Two years ago, Jamie was forced to deny dating Katie when a picture emerged of the two of them holding hands in a recording studio.  Katie was said to have been banned from having a public relationship under the strict terms of her quickie divorce from superstar Tom Cruise.  According to Radar Online, Holmes agreed not to publicly date another man for five years in exchange for US$5.8 million in child support and US$6.2 million payment for herself.  An insider claimed: “Katie signed a clause in her quickie divorce settlement that prevents her from embarrassing Tom in various ways, like talking about him or Scientology, or publicly dating another man for five years after the divorce.  “She’s allowed to date, but she cannot do so in a public fashion, and she’s not supposed to let any boyfriend near their daughter, Suri.”  She was said to have had gone to extraordinary lengths to keep relationship with Jamie a secret.  The Sun has contacted Katie and Jamie’s representatives for comment.  This article originally appeared on The Sun and has been republished with permission.",fake

3116,"The most recent cover of The National Enquirer features a photograph of George Michael. He looks to be lying down with his eyes, closed, and the cover reads, “George Michael THE LAST PHOTO!” It also says “Pop Icon’s Suicide Note Found.” The problem is that this isn’t actually how the photo was taken. Our cousin site Gossip Cop, who has been busting bad dish for years writes, “This is a blatant manipulation. In actuality, the publication took a grainy, previously published paparazzi photo of Michael and rotated it 45 degrees. As a result, it appears as if Michael is laying dead, when in reality, he was upright at a dinner party when the picture was taken.”  Gossip Cop notes that ” The National Enquirer doesn’t explicitly say it is a ‘death photo,’ but that certainly seems to be the implication by the way it is abnormally featured.”  Additionally, the “suicide note” mentioned on the cover isn’t actually a suicide note at all. Instead, the tabloid put together “words from a series of interviews” that he gave long before he died. Within the article, the magazine admits that the photo was taken two months before he died, which Gossip Cop says is “likely only done to remove liability and prevent the outlet from getting sued.”  [image: The National Enquirer]  Have a tip we should know?

See Why Her Swifties Are Split  Taylor Swift dropped the second song off her upcoming album Reputation on Sunday morning, causing a massive debate amongst her Swifties on social media over the inspiration behind “…Ready for It.”  Many immediately went wild for the catchy tune (read the full lyrics here) saying it was written about her boyfriend Joe Alwyn, whom Swift has been dating since late last year.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Some boys are trying too hard / He don’t try at all though / Younger than my exes but he acts like such a man, though,” sings Swift, 27, on the track.  Alwyn, 26, is seven years younger than Calvin Harris and 10 years younger than Tom Hiddleston, whom Swift dated before the British actor.  Just as many fans, however, are positive the song was inspired by Harry Styles. Though she’s never confirmed the rumors, many believe her hit songs “Style” and “Out of the Woods” off her 1989 album were written about the former One Direction singer, who is 23 years old.  Styles’ song “Two Ghosts” off his recent solo album is rumored to be a direct response to Swift’s “Style” because of his lyrics “Same lips red, same eyes blue / Same white shirt, couple more tattoos.” In “Style,” she sings “I got that red lip, classic thing that you like … You got that long hair slicked back, white T-shirt.”",real
8419,"Game of Thrones type TV Show network HBO Where to watch Close Streaming Options  Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have responded to criticism of their planned HBO drama series that imagines a modern-day America where slavery is legal, calling the outrage ""a little premature.""  On Wednesday, the network announced Confederate, a new series from the showrunners of the channel's Emmy-winning, worldwide sensation, Game of Thrones. The alternate-history tale chronicles events leading to the ""Third American Civil War,"" where the Southern states have successfully seceded from the Union, and slavery has evolved into a modern institution. Online reaction to the concept ranged from curious and excited to shocked and appalled, with some detractors accusing HBO of making a show that sounds like a white supremacist fantasy.  On Thursday, Benioff and Weiss — along with producers Nichelle Tramble Spellman (Justified) and Malcolm Spellman (Empire) — spoke to Vulture about the project and the backlash it received, with Benioff noting no scripts for Confederate have been written yet.  ""So everything is brand new and nothing's been written,"" Benioff said of the show. ""I guess that's what was a little bit surprising about some of the outrage. It's just a little premature. You know, we might f— it up. But we haven't yet.""

""I do understand their concern,"" Nichelle Tramble Spellman said. ""I wish their concern had been reserved to the night of the premiere, on HBO, on a Sunday night, when they watched and then they made a decision after they watched an hour of television as to whether or not we succeeded in what we set out to do. The concern is real. But I think that the four of us are very thoughtful, very serious, and not flip about what we are getting into in any way. What I've done in the past, what Malcolm has done in the past, what the D.B.s have done in the past, proves that. So I would have loved an opportunity for the conversation to start once the show was on the air.""  ""You cannot litigate this on Twitter. It's not possible,"" added Malcolm Spellman. ""I don't know that we can change anyone's mind… but what people have to understand is, and what we are obligated to repeat in every interview is: We've got black aunties. We've got black nephews, uncles. Black parents and black grandparents. We deal with them every single day. We deal with the struggle every single day. And people don't have to get on board with what we're doing based on a press release. But when they're writing about us, and commenting about us, they should be mindful of the fact that there are no sell-outs involved in this show. Me and Nichelle are not props being used to protect someone else.

The concept bears some similarity to Amazon's drama series The Man in the High Castle, which imagines what would happen if German and Japan had won World War II. That series, based Philip K. Dick's novel, has largely escaped criticism, yet also isn't about Southern state slavery. Another series that comes to mind is Hulu's acclaimed dystopian drama The Handmaids Tale, adapted from the book by Margaret Atwood, which posits a future in which most women are infertile, and those who are able to bear children serve as reproductive slaves for the wealthy.  Confederate has been ordered straight to series and is expected to get underway after the eighth and final season of Thrones airs in either 2018 or 2019.  Image zoom  Benioff and Weiss are no strangers to generating controversy on Thrones, a drama that's tackled the subject of slavery, albeit wrapped in a fantasy setting. The show has also been accused of not having a diverse enough cast (most recently by Star Wars actor John Boyega), though there are several actors of color among its supporting ensemble. The showrunners have previously said they try to avoid paying attention to online reactions and instead focus on making the best show they can.  ""You look at a message board and there might be nine positive comments, but the 10th one is negative — and that's the one you'll remember, that's what sticks in your head,"" Benioff told EW a few years back. ""And you want to have an argument with the person: ‘Well, here's why this happened [in the show],' and you can't. You start having an argument in your mind, and you realize you're losing your mind. You're having an internal argument with somebody named DragonQueen42. You're never going to win that argument.""",real

Rodriguez/Getty Images  The drama between the Fast and Furious co-stars began in September, when Gibson left a comment on Johnson’s Instagram post, asking him not to let a rumored spinoff film starring Johnson’s character, Agent Hobbs, push back the planned release date of Fast 9.  “I’m simply trying to reach him cause he won’t call me back about this solo #HobbsMovie,” Gibson wrote in the lengthy comment. “I want you to shoot it just not right now cause the #Fast9 release date has already been announced.”  The feud escalated one month later, when Gibson called out Johnson on Instagram, and slammed his critical and commercial flop, Baywatch.    Johnson defended himself on Twitter.  ""My goal from day 1 was to come in and create an exciting/fun character for the fans, elevate the franchise and build it out,"" he tweeted.  Gibson also took to Twitter, to call his co-star ""selfish.""  ""The real selfish #CandyA** revealed,"" Gibson wrote. ""And why you on Twitter?? You lost my number right? I'm at you when I see you #Family.""  ""You still promoting a movie that no one wants to see made you clown,"" he continued.  Of course, Johnson didn't take the shady tweets lying down.  ""Pumped to expand and build out the FAST & FURIOUS universe in a cool, exciting way,"" Johnson captioned yet another Instagram post, adding, ""Thank you UNIVERSAL STUDIOS for being tremendous partners who see the big picture and for coming to us years ago with this spinoff idea.""    ""I have a tremendous amount of respect for this franchise that I’ve enjoyed droppin’ blood and sweat in over the years,"" he continued. ""And my vision is to create greater opportunities for not only my fellow FF cast mates, but for other amazing actors as well who want to be a part of something new and cool.The more opportunities we can create the better for the fans. Smart business,"" he argued. ""Let’s have some FUN and to quote, Hobbs the boss, if you don’t like it, we’re happy to beat that a** like a Cherokee drum. #CandyA**esNeedNotApply.""  Although Gibson Instagrammed in November that he was out of the Fast and the Furious franchise if Johnson was in, he later claimed he was ""never mad"" at Johnson .... though continued to slam him.  ""So the Rock how does it feel bro?.... going home to your daughter every night,"" he asked, referencing his highly publicized custody battle over daughter Shayla. ""It was 60 days before I seen my baby..... and all I asked you to do 'privately' was NOT accept a role that would deeply affect us all....... You are simply NOT the people’s champ..... you are a selfish champ.""  3. Kanye West vs. JAY-Z  Getty Images  The two close friends and collaborators' falling out continued this year, after West publicly called JAY-Z out during an onstage concert rant last November.  ""You got hurt, because this guy was talking about you on a stage,"" JAY-Z commented in August during an interview with Elliott Wilson and Brian ""B.Dot"" Miller on the Rap Radar podcast. ""But what really hurt me, you can't bring my kid or my wife into it. Like, Kanye is my little brother. He's talked about me a hundred times. He even made a song called ‘Big Brother.' We've gotten past bigger issues, but you brought my family into it, now it's a problem.""  In July, West reportedly left JAY-Z’s Tidal over a money dispute.  However, there is hope for those wishing for a Watch the Throne part two. During a Q&A with New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet for T: The New York Times Style Magazine in November, JAY-Z had a few conciliatory words for West, whom he still referred to as his ""brother.""  ""I [talked to] Kanye the other day, just to tell him, like, he's my brother,"" he recalled. ""I love Kanye. I do. It's a complicated relationship with us.""  Still, JAY-Z admitted that there's currently tension between the two.  ""But that happens,"" he stressed. ""In the long relationship, you know, hopefully when we're 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that. There's gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get through. And the only way to get through that is we sit down and have a dialogue and say, 'These are the things that I'm uncomfortable with. These are the things that are unacceptable to me. This is what I feel.' I'm sure he feels that I've done things to him as well. I'm not a perfect human being by no stretch.""  ""[West is] a very compassionate person,"" he added. And a lot of times he get in trouble trying to help others, So, I can identify with it. It's just that there's certain things that happened that's not really acceptable to me. ... And we just need to speak about it. But there's genuine love there.""  4. Camila Cabello vs. Fifth Harmony  Getty Images  Things turned messy between girl group Fifth Harmony and Camila Cabello pretty quickly after she announced she was leaving the group last December, and the remaining members -- Lauren Jauregui, Ally Brooke, Normani Kordei and Dinah Jane -- claimed in a statement that they only learned of her departure through her representatives.  In an interview with Billboard in February, Cabello talked about the “intense” split and admitted she hadn’t spoken to her former bandmates.  ""I was always super open [that] I couldn’t just sing other people’s words and be totally happy with that,"" Cabello said of exiting the group. ""You have to follow and honor that inner voice. I always encouraged the girls to do the same.""  ""I don’t want to get into the details of that, because it was really intense and it’s hard for me to talk about,"" she added about not keeping in touch. ""It makes me sad.""  In their own Billboard interview in July, Fifth Harmony wasn’t shy about alluding to the bad blood.  “Let’s just say we’re in a better place now -- there are no secrets in this circle,” Jane said of Cabello's exit.  However, the shadiest moment definitely happened at the MTV Video Music Awards in August, when before their performance of ""Angel"" and ""Down,"" a a fifth member of the group -- presumably meant to represent Cabello -- fell backwards off the stage.  The group later denied they were slamming Cabello during an interview with Good Morning America.  “We get asked all the time if we’re getting a fifth member,” Brooke explained. “And we wanted to show the world in an artistic way that, ‘Hey, the four of us are Fifth Harmony. We are stronger and better than we’ve ever been.""  5. Kim Cattrall vs. Sex and the City Cast  New Line Cinema  Rumors have floated around for some time now that Kim Cattrall didn't get along with her Sex and the City cast members, and they were pretty much confirmed this year, after Sarah Jessica Parker announced that there would be no Sex and the City 3 film.  ""It's over... we're not doing it,"" she told Extra. “I’m disappointed. We had this beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story. It’s not just disappointing that we don’t get to tell the story and have that experience, but more so for that audience that has been so vocal in wanting another movie.”  The Daily Mail later reported that it was Cattrall's ""demands"" that put a stop to the project, claiming she insisted that Warner Bros. produce other movies she had in development before signing onto SATC 3. Cattrall denied the report on Twitter.  Woke 2 a @MailOnline 💩storm! The only 'DEMAND' I ever made was that I didn't want to do a 3rd film....& that was back in 2016 — Kim Cattrall (@KimCattrall) September 29, 2017  Cattrall then specifically called out Parker during an interview with Piers Morgan for ITV's Life Stories.  ""At this very moment, it’s quite extraordinary to get any kind of negative press about something that I’ve been saying for almost a year,"" she noted. ""This is really where I take to task the people from Sex and the City, specifically Sarah Jessica Parker, in that I think she could have been nicer,"" she expressed to Morgan. ""I really think she could have been nicer.""  ""I don’t know what her issue is, I never have,"" she added.  Cattrall also said she was never friends with her SATC co-stars, including Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis.  ""We‘ve been colleagues and in some ways, it’s a very healthy place to be because then you have a clear line between your professional life and relationship and your personal,"" she noted. ""They all have children and I am 10 years older, and since, specifically, the series ended, I have been spending most of my time outside of New York, so, I don’t see them. The common ground that we had was the series, and the series is over.""  Though she did admit that she wishes her co-stars would try harder to keep in touch, after sharing that she couldn't even recall the last time she had spoken to them.  ""That’s another thing that’s really disappointing, is that nobody ever picks up the phone and tries to contact you and say, ‘How you doing?’"" she shared.  …. And it appears the cast is taking sides. Willie Garson -- who portrayed Stanford Blatch, the best friend of Carrie Bradshaw (Parker) in both the TV series and the movies -- posted a cryptic tweet in October that appeared to be aimed at Cattrall. Cattrall repeatedly denied that she ever considered doing a third SATC movie and further claimed that she never began contract negotiations.  ""Dear fans, because I'm ""toxic,"" I'm going to negotiate a contract for 6 months, not come to terms, then say I never wanted to do it anyway,'"" he wrote.  Dear fans, because I'm ""toxic"", I'm going to negotiate a contract for 6 months, not come to terms, then say I never wanted to do it anyway. — Willie Garson (@WillieGarson) October 4, 2017  6. Katy Perry vs. Taylor Swift    Getty Images  The epic Katy Perry vs. Taylor Swift feud continued with the promotion of both their respective albums this year -- Perry's Witness and Swift's Reputation. Perry didn't hold back during her Carpool Karaoke segment with James Corden in June, addressing the beef head-on.  ""Honestly, it's really like she started it and it's time for her to finish it,"" Perry said after the Late Late Show host asked her to clear things up. ""She wouldn't speak to me. I do the right thing any time that it feels like a fumble. It was a full shutdown and then she writes a song about me and I'm like, 'OK, cool, cool, cool. That's how you wanna deal with it?'""  In an interview with NME, Perry gave background on why she decided to address the feud with Corden.  “I mean, I’m not Buddha -- things irritate me,” she said. “I wish that I could turn the other cheek every single time, but I’m also not a pushover, you know? Especially when someone tries to assassinate my character with little girls [her fans]. That’s so messed up!”  Though Swift stayed silent on Perry's comments about her, she let her actions do the talking. Swift surprisingly announced on June 8 that her entire catalog will return to all streaming services at midnight -- just when Perry's Witness dropped.  Swift also took thinly veiled digs at Perry in her ""Look What You Made Me Do"" music video that dropped in August. Swift dresses up very similar to Perry in the shade-filled video and gets into a car crash -- a moment that looks very close to the accident in Perry's ""Unconditionally"" music video. She also pointedly holds a GRAMMY, highlighting that she has 10 accolades, while Perry has zero.  Later, Swift is in a vault, robbing a bank and wearing a sweatshirt that features a glittery tiger, along with a cat mask, seemingly mocking the name of Perry's fanbase, KatyCats.  YouTube  7. Caitlyn Jenner vs. The Kardashians  Getty Images  Caitlyn Jenner's relationship with the Kardashian family deteriorated after the August release of her memoir, The Secret of My Life, which didn't exactly paint the Kardashians in a positive light. Kris Jenner claimed on Keeping Up With the Kardashians that Caitlyn's stories about her were ""all made up.""  ""My mom has been so fair to Cait, and Cait just has no decency towards my mom whatsoever,"" Kim Kardashian West later told KUWTK cameras, clearly siding with her mother. ""I feel like my mom is carrying this burden and feeling like she had to maintain a relationship with Caitlyn for all the kids. But we're grown up. I don't think my mom has to try anymore. It's time to move on.""  In September, Caitlyn said she hadn't spoken to Kris or Kim since the book's release.  “I went overboard to be nice, to be friendly, to be open, but also tell my story and my side of the story,” Caitlyn said during an appearance on Good Morning Britain. “Since the book came out, I’ve never talked to Kris again. Kim, I haven’t talked to in six, nine months, whatever it is.”  ""It’s unfortunate, because actually Kim was the first one I talked to about this issue,” she continued. ""She was very straightforward with me. She’s been very, very good on it. It’s a big loss in my life, not having her there anymore. To me, I mean, that’s sad.""  Currently, the relationship is showing no signs of repair.  The I Am Cait star spoke to students at Cambridge Union in England in November, where amid discussing her 2015 transition and its aftermath, she revealed that she and Kim haven't spoken in ""a year.""  “It’s been a little bit tough over the last couple of years on the Kardashian side,"" Caitlyn acknowledged. ""To be honest, I don't talk to them anymore. Kim, I haven't talked to in a year.""  ""They don't want me in their lives, they bashed me pretty badly,"" she continued. ""It's devastating when your kids do that. It really hurt.""  8. Drake Bell vs. Josh Peck  Getty Images  The state of the Drake & Josh co-stars' friendship made headlines in June, when Bell made it clear he was upset that he wasn't invited to Peck's wedding to Paige O'Brien. Although Bell wasn't present at the ceremony, Peck's Grandfathered co-star, John Stamos, was, as well as Jason Nash, whom Peck also acted with on Drake & Josh.  In now deleted tweets, Bell made his feelings known.  ""When you're not invited to the wedding the message is clear…"" Bell tweeted. ""Loyalty is key… ALWAYS remember where you came from.""  ""True colors have come out today,"" he added. ""Message is loud and clear. Ties are officially cut. I'll miss ya brotha.""  For his part, Peck made it clear that he no longer had a close relationship with Bell during his appearance on the Allegedly with Theo Von & Matthew Cole Weiss podcast.  ET spoke to Bell in July, when he explained the emotional tweets.  ""We've been together 18 years, Josh and me, me and Josh,"" Bell shared. ""We've been so close, it was just one of those things where, you know, I'd been talking to him, and he's been telling me about the engagement. And then I saw on social media, the wedding, and I didn't hear about it. So, it was just one of those things where it was just like, 'You didn't even tell me?! I had to find out on social media?' And then you're like, 'You know what!? Fine!' and then I'm like, wait, I probably shouldn't have done that.""  ""Yeah, I said the ties are cut or whatever, but I should have just texted that to him, you know,"" he continued. ""I was just being cranky.""  To solidify that the two had no hard feelings, they later reunited at the MTV VMAs in August.  9. Justin Bieber vs. Marilyn Manson    Matt Winkelmeyer, Kevin Mazur/Getty Images  One of the most bizarre feuds of the year was between pop star Justin Bieber and goth rocker Marilyn Manson. During an interview with Billboard in September, Manson said he confronted Bieber at a bar when he saw that the ""Sorry"" singer was selling shirts with Manson's face on the front and Bieber's name on the back, as part of his official Purpose World Tour merchandise.  ""I saw a little girl in a pink hoodie with blond hair, and it turns out to be Bieber. I sit down, and I say, 'Hey, so you wore my shirt and everything onstage,'"" Manson recalled. ""He was one of those touchy people that hit you when they talk, and he comes up to about d**k height. Then he goes, 'I made you relevant again.'""  Manson said he got revenge by not showing up to a planned duet between the two at Bieber’s show that he suggested.  ""I reply, 'That was a great idea you had about doing [my song] 'The Beautiful People' at your show at Staples Center tomorrow.' And he goes, 'Yeah, it was,' not knowing that I told him an idea that I had just made up,"" Manson shared. ""His tour manager sat down, and I asked, 'What time is sound check tomorrow? What time should I be there? Because we’re going to do 'Beautiful People.’ Obviously, when 4 p.m. rolled around the next day, I just didn't show.""  Manson later claimed Bieber apologized to him through text during Manson’s appearance on Howard Stern's Sirius XM show.  Quoting Bieber’s supposed texts, Manson read, “Honestly, I totally thought we hit it off. My bad. If I was an a**hole, it wasn't my intention.”  ""I don't really care about the media,"" Manson continued to read from Bieber's supposed texts. ""I just wanna make sure you and I were good. ‘Cause I like you.""  Manson further reflected on their feud.  ""He sassed me and he apologized,"" Manson explained. ""And I said I wouldn't s**t talk him, so I wouldn't s**t talk him.""  ",fake

1539,"What! Brad Pitt is crushing over a 21-year-old Angelina Jolie-lookalike!  According to a recent report by In Touch, the 53-year-old Hollywood actor is falling for 21-year-old actress Ella Purnell, who has portrayed the younger version of Angelina Jolie in Maleficent (2014).  Also read: Is there a squabble going on between Angelina Jolie's sons Maddox and Pax?  She was recently cast in the lead role of Starz's upcoming TV series ""Sweetbitter,"" which is being produced by Pitt. Hence, In Touch claimed that Pitt has been smitten by Purnell's performance in the movie so he cast her in his new series.  ""He's so enchanted,"" the source told In Touch.  ""Brad had Ella in mind from the get-go. He went out of his way to cast her,"" the source added. ""Ella is incredibly flattered by all the attention she's getting from Brad. She's told friends he's always been her No. 1 celebrity crush.""  The report also explained that Angelina Jolie is reportedly being furious about Brad falling for someone who is 32 years younger than him and ""her [Purnell] being cast in Sweetbitter.""  ""She absolutely hates that Brad is cavorting with someone who played the teenage version of her in a film,"" the insider added.  ""[Brad] realizes the huge age difference and that everyone would look at the relationship as a midlife crisis mistake,"" the source explained.  But according to the insider, Brad's attraction to Ella is more than just physical. ""He's taken with Ella's spunky, funny demeanour or and formidable acting skills.""  ""It's only a matter of time before Brad takes their relationship to the next level,"" the source added.  Meanwhile, another website named Gossip Cop looked over the matter. The website, which is better known for rubbishing these kinds of rumours, claimed that this story is 'entirely fabricated.'  Ever since Brangelina split happened, a few websites including In Touch, Hollywood Life are consistently reporting many stories on these two Hollywood A-listers and their current relationship status.  This particular report was seemingly concocted simply because Pitt is coincidentally working with a young actress who played his estranged wife in a movie, noted Gossip Cop.",fake

Oct 5, 2017  AceShowbiz - You may not see kids among ""America's Got Talent"" contestants in next year's season. The show's judge as well as executive producer Simon Cowell reportedly is considering to ban kids from the NBC show.  Naughty Gossip reveals that Simon is worried that ""America's Got Talent"" is turning into a kiddie's talent show, and the fact that this year's winner is 12-year-old singing ventriloquist Darci Lynne is not helping either. ""This year the two finalists were children. Last year's winner [Grace VanderWaal] was a kid too. The fear is that next year no one older than 15 will even bother auditioning,"" the source says.  ""The most talented adult in America doesn't stand a chance against a child with a homemade puppet. Now Simon is stepping in to fix the problem,"" the source continues. ""It doesn't take anything away from the folks that have already won, but next season is going to be very different with new rules.""  It remains to be seen how exactly the new season will be different. Previously, Simon said that what he loved about ""America's Got Talent"" is that there were no age limit. ""There are no rules. I applaud the fact that you have paid your dues. You have such a great heart, such a great talent, this has been amazing yet again,"" said the British producer while gushing over season 12 contestant, a subway singer Mike Yung.  Season 12 of the show announced Darci as the winner . 10-singer-old singer Angelica Hale came out as the runner-up while Ukrainian dance troupe Light Balance took the third place.

People LOVE when couples rekindle their romances, but is a reunion in the cards for Kristen Stewart, 27, and Robert Pattinson, 31? The Twilight alums were spotted “hanging out” together on Feb. 11, and we’re hearing that the former couple are on good terms now! “It’s taken a long time to get there, but Rob and Kristen are finally friends again,” a source close to Rob told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Their break-up was so painful for Rob, and he felt so angry and humiliated by Kristen cheating, that at one point he doubted he would ever be able to fully forgive her. But, time heals and Rob’s now managed to put the past behind him and let bygones be bygones.”  But even though the pair have a past with each other, don’t expect them them to be getting together in the future. “Rob and Kristen have so much shared history, they were together during the craziest time in their lives, they pretty much grew up together during the whole Twilight madness, and they really understand each other better than anyone else could. Rob still has a lot of love and respect for Kristen, but it’s evolved from romantic feelings into a deep friendship,” the insider added.  If you’re bummed that Bella and Edward won’t be living the rest of eternity together IRL, listen, I get it. We all are gunning for our faves to rekindle their lost love.

Taylor Swift sent fans into a frenzy when opening up about the meaning of her new album, Reputation, and how she found love again.  “[I] think there was a bit of a bait-and-switch that happened with this album when we put out ‘Look What You Made Me Do’ and we’re like, ‘Guys, this album is gonna be one thing.’ And then the album came out,” Swift, 28, told fans at her intimate Taylor Swift NOW concert hosted by AT&T in Chicago on Wednesday, August 29, according to Entertainment Tonight. “It’s legitimately an album about finding love throughout all the noise.”  The Grammy winner elaborated on her remarks, seemingly referencing her boyfriend, Joe Alwyn. “I starts with the noise and how that makes all you feel and how it makes you feel when people are saying things about you that you feel, like, aren’t true and living your sort of life in defiance of that. And then, sort of, in the middle of the album you kind of realize, ‘How much do I really value that?’ she explained. “If you can find something real in spite of a bad reputation, then isn’t that what matters the most to you? And doesn’t it matter the most to you that you know who your real friends are now?”  Alwyn, 27, has supported Swift on many stops along her Reputation tour. The duo, whose relationship made headlines in May 2017, recently enjoyed a getaway in London earlier in August. Back in July, the pair jetted off to Turks and Caicos for a July 4 vacation in lieu of Swift’s annual bash.  “They seemed genuinely happy,” an onlooker told Us Weekly at the time of the twosome as they strolled beachside. “They were always smiling and close to each other, but kept to themselves.”  A source told Us later that month that Swift and Alwyn are the perfect pair. “Joe has really showed her a different lifestyle and the value of privacy,” noted the insider. “She’s the happiest she’s ever been.”  Taylor Swift NOW will be available on AT&T’s DirectTV channels (Ch. 1113) or DIRECTV NOW or U-Verse (Ch. 1501) on Thursday, August 30.",fake
11877,"Last week, the newly renovated home-goods floor of the Tiffany & Co. flagship, on Fifth Avenue, was opened to the public. Reimagined by the company’s recently appointed chief creative officer, Reed Krakoff, late of Coach, it now features, in addition to several rooms of glass cases displaying wares, a café—every surface of which is done in the brand’s signature shade of turquoise. The headlines have all been almost exactly the same: “Finally, You Can Have Breakfast at Tiffany.” “Here’s What Having Breakfast at Tiffany’s Really Looks Like.” “You Can Literally Have Breakfast at Tiffany’s.” “I Tried to Have Breakfast at Tiffany’s.” They refer, of course, to the opening scene of “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” the iconic 1961 film adaptation of Truman Capote’s 1958 novella, in which Audrey Hepburn arrives at this very store, the block empty of all other people, at what’s meant to be the crack of dawn after a long night of revelry. Wearing a black ball gown with matching gloves, an elaborate updo, oversized sunglasses, and several lush strands of pearls, she gets out of a cab, carrying a small white paper bag, and walks up to one of the windows displaying jewelry. Barely taking her eyes off the diamonds, she opens the bag and removes a cup of coffee and a pastry, which she bites into, her skeletal jaw working hard as the strings swell on “Moon River,” the movie’s theme song, which was written for Hepburn.  Though her character, Holly Golightly—opaquely drawn as a high-end call girl—is something of a down-on-her-luck striver, an outsider looking in and up, the scene is not about longing or aspiration so much as it is about ritual and the search for simple, almost pastoral pleasures in a dense and hectic city. The street is hers alone; the coffee and pastry are hers alone; the window displays, even, are hers alone. Explaining the store’s draw, later in the film (and, almost word for word, in Capote’s novella), she says that, when she’s feeling awful, “The only thing that does any good is to jump in a cab and go to Tiffany’s. Calms me down right away. The quietness and the proud look of it. Nothing very bad could happen to you there.”  Times have changed, to say the least. Tiffany & Co. now shares a block and a wall with Trump Tower, a place where very bad things seem likely to have happened, a place where you may have recently stood in the middle of a surging mass of people chanting “Shame! Shame! Shame!” during a political protest. Approaching the store requires maneuvering, at any hour, around large, ugly plastic barriers, and, for a certain kind of person, thinking about the state of the nation. Nonetheless, on Tuesday morning, I, too, tried to have breakfast at Tiffany’s. The first-come-first-serve café opened last Friday, at 10 A.M., and I’d read that people had waited in line for two hours—which seems insane by most standards but not, sadly, by those of New York restaurant-going, and I’d cleared my morning. Standing on the opposite side of the street, waiting to cross, just after ten, I squinted and looked for a line, outside of either the Fifth Avenue entrance or the Fifty-seventh Street one, but I saw no one. Feeling triumphant—the buzz must have died down quickly, I thought—I marched toward the revolving doors and asked a bright-eyed young uniformed attendant how to get to the café. Bubble, burst: it’s on the fourth floor, he graciously informed me—but entirely booked for most of the day, on account of people showing up at 7 A.M. to start waiting. He suggested returning around three-thirty. “But you’re welcome to head up there to get more information!” he added.  Upstairs, at the host stand, the prognosis was even worse. Two men of incredible poise, both in suits and one with a posh British accent, told me calmly what they must have told dozens of hopefuls before me: in fact, people had begun to line up at midnight, and coming back at three-thirty was a long shot, but I could try again tomorrow. About a dozen sad-looking young women in black tights and wool jackets stood listlessly against the railing that led to the stairs, peering into the dining room, where other young women were taking DSLR and iPhone photos of “Tiffany Tea,” an assortment of finger sandwiches and sweets that arrive on a tiered stand. I asked to see a menu. Breakfast, at Tiffany, is a prix fixe (for twenty-nine dollars) that includes coffee or tea; a croissant with Nutella and honey butter; seasonal fruit; and your choice of a selection of entrées ranging from truffled eggs with bacon to buttermilk waffles to, of course, avocado toast. “Good morning, welcome, congratulations, you made it!” I heard a chipper server say as he showed a group of four to their table. “We love your passion.”  I wasn’t going to have breakfast at Tiffany’s. Instead, I wandered around the home-goods floor, just as Krakoff intended, gazing at artfully arranged crystal decanters and candlesticks. In another scene in the movie, Hepburn brings her love interest—a writer, similarly striving, played by George Peppard—to Tiffany, during business hours. He wants to buy her something; she acquiesces, but only if it costs less than ten dollars, she insists. There’s one item, offers a kindly sales associate: a sterling-silver telephone dialer for $6.75, including tax. “Well, the price is right,” Peppard says. “But, uh, I must say, I was hoping for something slightly more . . . how shall I say it . . . romantic in feeling.” In the end, they decide to have something engraved: a ring from a box of Cracker Jack.  I imagine they no longer carry a telephone dialer, but Krakoff has more than one-upped it with his new line of “Everyday Objects”: a sterling-silver “tin” can, for a thousand dollars; a sterling-silver ball of yarn, for nine thousand; a pair of coffee cups that look like they’re made of paper but are in fact bone china, and cost ninety-five dollars. Looking around to make sure no one was watching, I tapped a lemon beside a white-and-turquoise teapot to make sure it wasn’t real. A bunch of plastic bananas taunted me from the saddle bag of a turquoise bike. A faux tomato sat beside a sterling-silver plate etched with the image of a sandwich. A handful of dog biscuits were scattered around an engraved water dish—those were real. I thought about how Kate Moss once said, “Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.” And then I rode the elevator back down to the ground floor and crossed Fifth Avenue, in search of a pastry and a cup of coffee.",real

The pair had spent most of the programme apart before they were finally reunited in season six, but Jon Snow’s (played by Kit Harington) involvement with Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) may be a problem. Yesterday saw Game of Thrones fans get their first glimpse at the final series when Entertainment Weekly published the first official picture for season eight. The publication also released a behind-the-scenes report on the HBO series and it hints at something very interesting. It looks like the season will feature a lot of hints toward the very first instalment.  It read: “Instead of King Robert’s procession arriving, it’s Daenerys and her army. “What follows is a thrilling and tense intermingling of characters – some of whom have never previously met, many who have messy histories – as they all prepare to face the inevitable invasion of the Army of the Dead.” But it goes on to add that there may be tension between Sansa and Jon because of his new love interest to whom he has pledged his loyalty. The report continued: “Sansa isn’t thrilled that Jon bent the knee to his fancy new Targaryen girlfriend, at least not at first.” So, it could be that she comes round to the idea eventually. Littlefinger (Aidan Gillen) tried to plant seeds in Sansa’s head about Jon betraying the North by allying himself with Daenerys in season seven. However, his devious plotting was found out and Arya (Maisie Williams) executed him as the sisters pulled off an incredible revenge plan.  Game of Thrones season 8 spoilers: Jon and Sansa may have some disagreements  Game of Thrones season 8 spoilers: Jon and Daenerys are yet to find out they're related  Although there may be a disruption in Jon and Daenerys’ relationship if season seven’s finale was anything to go by. In the seventh run of the series, the theory that Jon is really the offspring of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen was finally proven. Subsequently, that makes Jon Daenrys’ nephew which may act as a bit of a passion killer. However, the pair of them are none the wiser to their family connection so it could prove to be an important plot point of the final series. But fans of the fantasy epic will just have to wait and see.  Game of Thrones season 8 spoilers: Jon and Sansa were reunited in the sixth series",real

19997,"Please cast your mind back to July 4th, 2016, otherwise known as The Day Tom Hiddleston Wore a T.S. Tank Top and Frolicked Gleefully in a Sea of Supermodels. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was Taylor Swift's annual Fourth of July party. A soiree brimming with it-girls, bemused shirtless men flopping down slides, and, you know, the usual suspects: Gigi Hadid, Karlie Kloss, Ed Sheeran, and...wait...Blake Lively?  You may not have seen her in the Squad Yearbook, but Blake and Tay actually go way back. It all started nine months ago, when Blake innocently Instagrammed this ""Bad Blood"" reference:  Naturally (by which we mean totally inexplicably), the internet assumed Blake was throwing shade, which prompted her to claim that she owns a Taylor Swift Voo Doo Doll. Like, in a fun way.  Basically, she was like, ""Are you there God? It's me, Blake,"" and Taylor was was like, ""yes, sweet summer child, I hath cometh.""  Flash-forward a few months, and Taylor meandered over to Australia where Blake was filming The Shallows. Their day of Kangaroo hijinks presumably went well, because Blake attended Taylor's 1989 World Tour and gazed upon other Squad Members. She saw the future, friends, and it was rich and bountiful. ""So it's gonna be forever,"" Blake probably whispered to herself on that fated night. ""Or it's gonna go down in flames.""  This content is imported from Twitter. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  Also, this photo was taken:  A few months later, it was Taylor's birthday. Being well versed in traveling pants-based friendship, Blake declared her love with this roller coaster picture. Note her apt use of the phrase ""goals."" She knew, guys. SHE KNEW.  Blake also sent Taylor a pie featuring her beloved cats in marzipan form. Of course, this *was* in her Preserve phase, so she was especially crafty at the time.

2991,"Blake Shelton and newbie judge Kelly Clarkson! The literally ""Walk Away!"" The battle between the contestants on the current season of The Voice is nothing compared to the explosive war between longtime country coachand newbie judgeThe two dueling divas went at it on-camera this week over who will nab this season's country star contestant and RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned their fighting didn't stop when camera's quit rolling.

Radar was the first to report that there was some serious bad blood between Shelton and Clarkson prior to the season starting. In an interview at that time, Shelton said, “Make no mistake, Kelly is my friend, But when she's on this show, she is my enemy.”  That became clear on Monday night's episode, when the two went at it over country music contestants Wilkes, 33, and Jordan Kirkdorffer, 28. When it became clear to Shelton that Clarkson wanted to steal his top contenders, he said, ""This is not a dating game. This is 'The Voice.'"" But their bickering didn't end there, Radar has learned.  According to an on-set source, ""Kelly and Blake's relationship off-camera is even worse than it is on-camera.

""They are together like every day now and it's gotten to the point where she just walks away because she can't win an argument with Blake. No one can because he is always right,"" the insider revealed.  As fans know, Clarkson inked an enormous contract to join The Voice this season and it seems to have been worth it, as the show's ratings have been through the roof — destroying competitor American Idol.

The Girls actor and writer and the Bleachers singer/songwriter had been a couple since 2012, but it has now been revealed that they separated last month.  “It was mutual,” a source told E! News. “Jack and Lena were growing apart and it just made sense for them to end their relationship where it was.”  Advertisement  They added: “They want the best for each other no matter what. They are both moving on.”  Representatives from the couple then confirmed that they were no longer together.  Bleachers, whose recent album ‘Gone Now‘ was named as one of NME’s best albums of 2017, last year had Dunham direct the video for ‘Don’t Take The Money‘.  Recent years have seen Antonoff act as producer and co-writer with the likes of St Vincent, Lorde and Taylor Swift – the latter once said that his relationship with Dunham inspired the ‘1989’ album track ‘You Are In Love‘.  “I’ve never had that, so I wrote that song about things that Lena [Dunham] has told me about her and Jack [Antonoff],” she said. “That’s just basically stuff she’s told me.

1371,"Did Carrie Underwood force Mike Fisher to retire so they can have a second baby? That’s the claim in this week’s tabloids. Gossip Cop, however, can reveal what’s really going on.  “Carrie Underwood: Baby #2 To Save Marriage,” reads a headline in the new issue of Star, which contends, “The country superstar pushed hubby Mike Fisher to quit pro hockey so they could work on their troubled relationship and having another child together.” After Fisher announced his retirement earlier this month, the tabloid is now claiming Underwood “made sure Mike understood it was the right time” to call it quits on his playing days.  A so-called “source” is quoted as saying, “Carrie told Mike in no uncertain terms to hang up his skates, in a dramatic attempt to get more together time to mend their troubled relationship.” But the gossip magazine’s supposed snitch doesn’t seem to have first-hand knowledge to back that assertion up. “I heard that she had become really unhappy with the situation.

Well, maybe Kim’s just giving Selena props for going blonde after she took the same plunge. While Kim kept her signature long, sleek hair and dyed it blonde (with some killer darker roots), Selena styled her in a voluminous bob.

Cameron, who shares two children with the Pistons power forward, paints her on-and-off again beau of eight years as a womanizer for “cruelly embarrassing his family with his public fawning over Kendall Jenner,” according to the suit, per TMZ Sports. Likening the situation to Griffin’s new NBA reality, signing a lucrative contract with the Clippers in June before being dealt to Detroit less than a year later, Cameron alleges the 6-foot-10 athlete traded her in for a newer model after breaking off their engagement.  “Griffin himself, however, knows very well what breaching promises is all about. After all, Griffin had no problem trading Brynn Cameron, his former fiancee, and the mother of his 2 children, for reality television star Kendall Jenner,” the docs state. Cameron, who played basketball at USC, also has a child with former Trojans star quarterback Matt Leinart.  Griffin and Jenner have been linked together since last summer and are believed to still be dating.  Cameron also included love letters from “Blakey” in the suit, in which she claims Griffin, 28, pledged his support in response to her dropping prior business obligations.  “Sometimes I take you and everything you do for granted but please know that I am constantly blown away by the mother, friend, daughter, sister, aunt, person, and partner you are to me and everyone that is lucky enough to call you even one of those things,” Griffin allegedly wrote in an undated note.  The NBA star’s one-time flame also claims she “strengthened” the bond between Griffin and his Clippers teammates, and “allowed the organization to see a different side of his personality rather than the hard-partying man-child Griffin had been prior to their cohabitation.”  Though its unclear how much Cameron is seeking from Griffin, the mother of two claims she is now strapped for cash as her ex’s wallet widens.  “While Griffin is continuing to earn millions from his NBA and endorsement deals, Cameron and their children are homeless and cash-strapped,” the suit states. “In Griffin’s absence, Cameron’s brother [Jordan, a former NFL tight end] has had to provide Cameron and the children with financial support.”",real

626,"Blake Shelton was named People's ""Sexiest Man Alive"" of 2017 and some people are not happy.

Time included Crews among the “the silence breakers” named in the magazine’s person of the year feature.  AD  AD  Now, Crews’s legal case has come to an end. On Thursday, William Morris Endeavor announced the lawsuit has been settled.  “Terry Crews, Adam Venit and WME have settled the lawsuit Mr. Crews filed last year,” the agency said in a statement, according to the Hollywood Reporter. “It will be dismissed.”  According to Deadline, Venit is also planning to retire from WME on Monday. He had previously been suspended and demoted following Crews’s allegation.  After news of the settlement and Venit’s exit, Crews responded on Twitter with a single word: “ACCOUNTABILITY,” he wrote.  That was the theme Crews has continually hit on since speaking out.  “People need to be held accountable,” the actor told “Good Morning America” last November. “This is the deal about Hollywood. It is an abuse of power. This guy, again, he’s one of the most powerful [men] in Hollywood, and he looked at me at the end as if, ‘Who is going to believe you?’”  AD  AD  “The assault lasted only minutes, but what he was effectively telling me while he held my genitals in his hand was that he held the power. That he was in control,” Crews told the Senate Judiciary Committee this summer. “As I shared my story, I was told over and over that this was not abuse. This was just a joke. This was just horseplay. But I can say one man’s horseplay is another man’s humiliation.”  In his lawsuit, filed last December, Crews recounted his alleged encounter with the star agent. “Venit, upon his first meeting Crews, viciously grabbed Crews’s penis and testicles so hard that it caused Crews immediate pain in a blatant and unprovoked sexual assault,” the lawsuit stated.  Crews, who was not Venit’s client, reportedly told his own WME agent about the assault the next day. But the agency did nothing, his lawsuit claimed, as part of “corporate culture that fosters environments in which WME agents are knowingly permitted and encouraged to engage in misconduct, including sexually predatory conduct.”  AD  AD  In court filings, Venit denied the allegations, the Associated Press reported.  According to the Reporter, a criminal investigation into the assault spearheaded by the Los Angeles Police Department commenced last November. In March, the prosecutors announced they were declining criminal charges because of “the lapse in statute of limitations for misdemeanor cases.”  But the allegations also triggered an internal review at WME. The Reporter wrote that the agency’s internal review determined that Crews’s allegation about Venit was “indicative of a pattern, rather than an isolated event.” The agent was bumped down from his position as the head of the agency’s motion picture group.  AD  Venit’s demotion — and now exit — from the industry represented a significant nose dive for a man who was a considerable force within Hollywood for more than three decades. According to Deadline, the agent started out working in the mailroom at Creative Artists Agency in 1986 after dropping out of law school. He later went on to represent some of the biggest movie stars in the business.",real

4033,"Oh boy. Photo: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images  The first rule of going solo: Distance yourself as far as possible from the group and fan base that jump-started your career. Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He’s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it’s all said and done. On Liam’s first single, “Strip That Down,” he’s dissed One Direction plain as day. “You know I used to be in 1D, now I’m out free,” he sings. “People want me for one thing, that’s not me. I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”    But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.

10656,"If her hilarious tweets and Instagram posts (oftentimes at the expense of her good-natured hubby, John Legend) weren't enough to make you google ""How to become best friends with Chrissy Teigen,"" then I'm sure the arrival of their daughter, Luna Simone, probably was. Seriously, you'll take one look at Luna and wonder how anyone ever accurately used the word ""adorable"" before she was born. If you're still looking for reasons to hop on the Teigen train, then look no further than this cuddly video of Chrissy Teigen & John Legend's new puppy.  According to People, the banana bread maven and her Grammy-winning husband have added a new puppy to their brood. Thankfully, there are adorable pictures and videos to prove it. Teigen first posted news of their new bulldog puppy to Instagram on Friday night, Oct. 6. The photo of Luna and Pepper — the new pup's name and Vilailuck Teigen's (Teigen's mom) nickname — naturally began raking in the likes.  In the first pic, you only really get a glimpse of the pup as Pepper hides out behind Luna, who is sporting her toddler-chic ensemble (OK, it's just a diaper but she really pulls it off flawlessly). Chrissy captioned it with:  what happens at lip sync battle does not always stay at lip sync battle @caseypattersontv @llcoolj  I'm not quite sure how Pepper and Lip Sync Battle are connected (People wasn't either), but I'll pretend I know what's happening just so the Cravings cookbook author doesn't think I'm an out-of-the-loop nerd.  Teigen, being the social media master that she is, probably knew that the people would want more pup... and oh, did she deliver.  Here is the first glimpse of Pepper.  Aww, look at Luna bonding with her new pup. This family is no stranger to dogs, either. According to People, Teigen and Legend already have three other dogs: two French Bulldogs named Penny and Pippa, and an English Bulldog named Puddy.  OK, now that you've got some background, I think you're ready for some video of Pepper in action. But really... prepare yourselves, you guys, because it has everything.  Not only are there puppy-sized yips, but there're also what looks like a little Luna stepping into the shot in the peripheral. One of the other dogs gets in on the fun, and Pepper is being called by her namesake, Teigen's mom, in the video.  You'll watch this video no less than five times.  I mean... I didn't think it was possible for the Teigen-Legend crew to get any cuter, yet they just did.  If you thought that was the end of it, hold on, because Teigen posted another gem to Instagram on late Friday night, Oct. 6. There are no puppies, but you will not be disappointed.  Teigen captioned it with, ""baby John = baby Luna,"" and one you get a look at the pic, you'll see that her math is spot-on. Seriously, they could be twins. First, let's get another look at baby Luna, so you are fully prepared to make an educated comparison (also, like who doesn't want see Luna?)  Here she is straight killing the chilling-in-a-wicker-chair game.  Here is the photo of baby John.  Not that you need it spelled out for you, but Legend is the one front-and-center in the photo. Now, Luna might be giving more a full-on smile in her pic, but the resemblance is pretty much uncanny. I'd bet seeing that makes Legend feel like one proud papa.  Even though they're both very successful, Teigen and Legend are not raising Luna with silver spoon in her mouth. From the looks of Teigen's Instagram, Luna is definitely going to help when it comes to taking care of the dogs.  Luna nailed that whole ""first chore"" thing.  Well, that's all the Teigen-Legend news I have for you today, which I'm sure is fine by you, because you'll probably just go rewatch that Pepper video now.

2437,"Gwen Stefani is getting candid about what life is like with ""the sexiest man in the world,"" Blake Shelton!  The 48-year-old singer was a guest on Tuesday's The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where she gushed over her country crooner beau, and opened up about whether the two have plans to get married.  ""He got sexier,"" Stefani joked, referencing her boyfriend being named ""Sexiest Man Alive"" by People magazine. ""And it just keeps getting better and cuter and more country.""  Host Ellen DeGeneres then asked the No Doubt rocker about all the tabloid rumors surrounding her and Shelton. Recent reports have claimed that the two are getting married, while others claim they're not ready yet, which Stefani briefly addressed.  ""It's weird because, I get nervous when you talk to me about him,"" she admitted. ""I don't know why, but for some reason, the cameras are rolling and I shouldn't say something. So if I say, 'We are [getting married],' then we are, and if I say, 'No, we're not,' then that would be sad, too.""  Stefani then asked DeGeneres -- who tied the knot with Portia de Rossi in 2008 -- for her advice on marriage, and what she thinks she ""should do about it.""  ""I love being married,"" DeGeneres marveled. ""I think you should get married.""  That's when Stefani began to open up a bit more, saying, ""You know what? I love weddings, the kids love him.""  ""We love him,"" she continued, speaking on behalf of the three kids, sons Kingston, Zuma and Apollo, that she shares with her ex-husband, Gavin Rossadale. ""Everybody loves him. He's lovable. I think about [marriage] all the time.""  Later in the show, Stefani also talked about her just-announced Las Vegas residency, Gwen Stefani: Just a Girl, coming to the Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino this summer. The platinum blond beauty is scheduled to play 25 live shows between June 2018 and March 2019.  ""I feel really nervous about it, but really excited,"" she admitted. ""I know I'm doing it, but it doesn't feel real.""  Stefani, along with residency promoter Live Nation Las Vegas and Caesars Entertainment, will also be using the exciting show to do some good. They've teamed up in partnership with Cure 4 The Kids Foundation, meaning $1 of every ticket sold will be donated to the Las Vegas-based non-profit charity.  ""Every ticket I sell for the show, $1 is going to Cure for Kids, which is a local Vegas charity,"" she explained to DeGeneres. ""It just feels good, you know?""

Another insider reportedly told the US publication, 'All the signs have been there for months now.  'It's wonderful news to be sure - but it shouldn't come as a shock to anyone.'  The Enquirer's shocking report claims 36-year-old Meghan secretly visited fertility doctors before her May 19 wedding to Prince Harry, who is sixth in line to the British throne.  'Harry and Meghan want to get pregnant as quickly as possible after their wedding,' a friend tells.  'They both know that as Meghan gets older, it can get increasingly harder to conceive - and they are both keenly aware of her vulnerability to health complications and the chance of miscarriage the older she gets.'  Along with fertility check-ups, Meghan also visited London-based nutritionist Melanie Brown at Kensington Palace, insiders told the Enquirer.  Brown, a 'specialist in fertility, IVF, and pregnancy,' who works out of Duke Street, gave Meghan pointers on 'pre-conceptual and pregnancy nutrition, including weight loss and gain, and immune issues.'  Harry, 33, also reportedly 'stepped up', meeting with nutritionist Gabriela Peacock on how he can drop weight and boost fertility.  Meghan and Harry's exciting baby news will mark the first time the monarchy has welcomed twins in almost 600 years.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's twin joy may have been the help of his genetics.

I don’t know when exactly but it’s because of the same church they go to. The community there is pretty tight knit and Justin and Selena have a lot of mutual friends who brought them back together. They realized it was time to grow past their history and move on.

4243,"Well, if the Trump administration follows through on its plan to roll back the requirement that insurers cover birth control (revealed in leaked government documents last week), you won’t have to imagine it. The documents outline a chilling proposal that would allow any employer to deny coverage of birth control at any time and for any reason. Women who rely on oral contraception would suddenly be living in a very different reality, one in which some could become disabled as their disease progressed.  For women with financial means, the rollback would be inconvenient and unfair, as other necessary medications remain covered. But for women living near or below the poverty line, it would be disastrous, jeopardizing their ability to work and provide for their families. Birth control pills can cost up to $50 a month without insurance, and in a 2010 survey, a third of female voters said they’d had trouble paying for them at some point. Low-income women who may not have access to expensive surgeries or other more advanced endometriosis treatments will be hit the hardest because they are the most reliant on oral contraceptives to manage their condition.  More women in this country are prescribed oral contraception for medical reasons than for pregnancy prevention. If the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress succeed in stripping funding from Planned Parenthood and giving employers carte blanche to deny women necessary medication under murky notions of moral disdain, all paths to health and wellness will disappear for a huge swath of Americans.  Between 1998 and last week, I’ve been to the emergency room over 50 times with endometriosis-related pain (this makes for some very cozy relationships with fun nurses, but it’s not a particularly sustainable or amusing life plan). Despite my access to remarkable doctors, oral contraceptives and even alternative treatments, my disease progressed to the point that I needed surgery, from which it has taken several months to heal. I had to use a walker after the operation. Even with my attempts to add bling to the item, it was a shocking reminder of what this illness can do (and of the fact that denying birth control isn’t just misogynistic but also deeply biased against people who are disabled by the disease). And yet I am one of the lucky ones. I can continue to do my job as a writer and a director, work directly with doctors to ensure my disease is controlled, and feel the support of millions when I am let down by my own body.",fake
2458,"As you've no doubt heard by now, Brad Pitt is a single man, having separated from Angelina Jolie back in September of 2016.  His first wife, Jennifer Aniston, is very much not single, having married Justin Theroux in 2015.  But that hasn't stopped the tabloid press from reporting that the old flames are eager to rekindle their romance.  Of course, for these two A-listers to get back together, that means the pesky C-lister getting in their way will need to be disposed of.  Thus, gossip columnists the world over are employing the trick most often used by screenwriters of romantic comedies in which one half of the meet-cute pair is already taken.  Yes, they're leaning hard on the ""Uh, her husband is a douche and they were already having problems before the hero entered the picture"" narrative.  According to Life & Style, Jen and Justin have spent most of the past year apart.  The magazine claims they only recently reunited for a New Year's Eve trip to Mexico ... and they brought a huge group of friends along to make the situation less awkward.  “They chose to go with friends during this particularly difficult time during their marriage. A week alone would’ve been too strained,” one insider says.  ""Had they been alone, the insider suspects, they would’ve been dealing with some uncomfortable conversations. They felt it would be easier and more relaxed to have some friends come along.”  The source adds that Aniston and Theroux have basically come to terms with the fact that their marriage is coming to an end, but they're still trying to hide the truth from members of their inner circle.  “The truth is that the marriage has been crumbling,” the insider adds.  “It’s not make-or-break time for them and their marriage.”  Of course, all of this couldn't come at a worse time, as Aniston has reportedly fallen back under Pitt's spell in recent months.  “Brad and Jen have bonded like never before over the past year,” a friend of theirs tells In Touch.  “And they’ve been helping each other through their respective troubles.”  Look, we suppose there's a possibility this is really happening, but it all sounds a little too close to what magazines like In Touch and Life & Style would want to happen for it to be entirely believable.

Six senior royals of the same generation of Queen Elizabeth II also have rooms there.  The Queen and Prince Philip live in Buckingham Palace, around 2 miles away.    With two royal weddings on the horizon, not to mention a newborn prince, 2018 is shaping up to be a year of massive change for Britain's royal family.  Advertisement  And the royal property that's ringing in the changes more than any other is undoubtedly the historic Kensington Palace in London, now home to 15 members of the royal family, spanning three generations.The palace, a royal residence since the 1600s, has taken on three new arrivals in the last month, making it easily the most bustling of the royal family's many grand homes.  Advertisement  Within its grounds are a host of separate properties, ranging from (relatively) humble cottages, to a grand, 20-room apartment occupied by Prince William, Kate Middleton and their young family.  As well as royal living quarters, which tend to be relatively sedately decorated, it is also home to lavish state rooms used for grand occasions, like this one:  Here's a breakdown of who's who, and where they live in Kensington Palace:    Prince William, Kate Middleton, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis: Apartment 1A  Advertisement  William, Kate, and their children are not only the largest group of royals in Kensington Palace, but the closest to the throne.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, they have the best rooms going. The family of five occupies Apartment 1A, a collection of 20 stately rooms with a commanding view of Hyde Park.  They moved to Kensington Palace full-time in October 2013, not long after their first child, Prince George, was born. Princess Charlotte followed in 2015, and Prince Louis in April 2018.  Advertisement  The public rarely get to see inside, but photographers were allowed to take photos of a reception room when William and Kate hosted the Obamas in 2016:  We also saw another view (or maybe even another room) where Prince George played on a rocking horse before meeting the President.  Advertisement  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: Nottingham Cottage  Significantly less grand is the two-bed cottage inhabited by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, which will also be their marital home after they marry on May 19.  The cottage, nicknamed ""Nott Cott"" and often described as ""snug,"" has been Harry's home since 2013.  Advertisement  Meghan moved in just after their engagement was made public in November 2017. Harry proposed to Meghan when they were spending an evening together at Nottingham Cottage, surprising her while they were roasting a chicken  After announcing their engagement, they gave an interview from the cottage, sitting on its sofa, which is one of the only times the public has seen inside:  Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank: Ivy Cottage  Advertisement  The newest royals at Kensington Palace are Princess Eugenie, who is William and Harry's cousin, and her fiancé Jack Brooksbank, a London socialite.  According to The Sun, the couple moved in to a cottage right next to Harry and Meghan's around the same time Kate was in hospital delivering Prince Louis.  Advertisement  The couple announced their engagement in January, a few weeks after getting engaged while vacationing in Nicaragua.  They are getting married at Windsor Castle in the same church as Harry and Meghan this October, but the occasion is likely to attract much less publicity.  The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester: Apartment 1  The Duke of Gloucester, one of Queen Elizabeth II's cousins, lives in Apartment 1 with the Duchess of Gloucester, his wife.  Advertisement  Like William and Kate's home at 1A, the dwelling is a large complex of rooms in the main palace building. The two used to be one enormous set of rooms until they were divided in the 1950s.  The complex has 21 rooms, slightly pipping the size of William and Kate's, but few details are available other than its overall size.  Prince and Princess Michael of Kent: Apartment 10  Advertisement  Prince Michael of Kent, another of the Queen's cousins but from a more junior line, lives in the main palace building with his wife.  She is known as Princess Michael in the old-fashioned tradition by which the wives of princes take their husband's name.  Advertisement  This same rule means that Kate can technically be referred to as Princess William of Cambridge, but the name is not widely used.  Their apartment, number 10, consists of five bedrooms and five receptions rooms. They used to have use of the property rent-free, but since 2008 they have been paying a reported £10,000 ($13,600) per month in rent.  The Duke and Duchess of Kent: Wren House  The Duke of Kent, Prince Michael's older brother, also lives in the Kensington Palace grounds with his wife, the Duchess.  Advertisement  Their home, Wren House, is named after the famous British architect Christopher Wren, who built St Paul's Cathedral and a slew of properties for the royal household.  Few details about their home have ever been made public. It is physically between Ivy and Nottingham cottages, and appears to be of a similar size.  What about the Queen?  Advertisement  Elizabeth II lives at Buckingham Palace with her husband, Prince Philip. It's around 2 miles from Kensington Palace, across Hyde Park and Green Park.  It's not quite as cosy as living on the same property - but if Her Majesty ever wants to drop in on her cousins, grandchildren or great-grandchildren, they aren't far away.",fake
5870,"Reality dramas based on the staff at some of Los Angeles' hottest bars are a hit that no one can deny enjoying, and E! is joining the party with this weekend's premiere of ""What Happens at The Abbey.""  Nestled in the center of arguably the hottest block of West Hollywood, The Abbey Bar and Restaurant is known for being a go-to spot for those who enjoy a night of fun alongside go-go boys and triple olive martinis. The world famous gay bar opened in 1991 and still reigns as one of the top nightlife locations in all of Los Angeles. ""What Happens at The Abbey"" follows the lives of 14 Abbey employees as they embark on careers in Hollywood beyond the bar.  TooFab was invited to a cocktail party at The Abbey, where the stars of E's new show mingled and dished on why this show is so not a decaf version of ""Vanderpump Rules.""  Almost all of the 250 + member staff of The Abbey auditioned to be part of the upcoming reality series, which executive producer Ray Giuliani said was discussed for the first time almost two years ago.  ""The first conversations started two years ago. People had approached [owner] David Cooley many times over the years to do a show and he never felt the time was right.""  ""So we finally started to do it. We interviewed everybody at The Abbey that wanted to be on the show and figured out who our people were.""  That cast includes gay, straight and lesbian Abbey employees who told TooFab what makes this bar THE place to hang out, and why their show is a lot less dramatic than ""Vanderpump Rules.""  “I think one thing for sure is that The Abbey is super fast paced and super funny,"" said Marissa Chykirda, [pictured below] the spunky long island hostess and newest member of The Abbey family. ""Yeah there's drama – but people are really funny on this show. I think 'Vanderpump' in one sense is very melodramatic but this is fast paced, high intensity and really funny.""  NBC  Lisa Vanderpump's hit Bravo series is taped at SUR restaurant and lounge, which is just down the block from The Abbey. Though natural competition is something that can be expected, Giuliani told TooFab that the biggest different between the shows is that the E! series is set up with a cast of wannabe Hollywood stars.  “I love Lisa and 'Vanderpump Rules.' Vanderpump as a show, you can't deny it's appeal,"" he said. ""What I think is different is that all of the people that work here have a Hollywood dream. When David hires people, he hires stars. The way he goes through his interview process is 'Who's the star? Who's the next big one?'""  NBC  ""I think that as well as the people here trying to figure out their sexual identity plays a big part in our show. The Abbey is a gay bar, and now there's a lot of straight people who work here, who come here to party… and in this day and age that's what happens, things start to mix and people start to figure out what they're doing and it's a judgment free zone,"" Guiliani told TooFab.  Of course any reality show especially those set in or around a business raise questions of authenticity. So naturally one of the most notable questions that arose when the first trailer dropped for ""What Happens at The Abbey"" was ""do all the cast members actually work there?""  But the cast at ""The Abbey"" told TooFab that claims that they don't all actually work at the bar are false.  NBC  ""There's no way you're coming in for every shift. The majority of people who come in come in after 9, they are already drunk so you see a few of the dancers and a bartender,"" said Billy Reilich, [pictured above] the studly Abbey employee who is most known as ""Nick the Gardner"" on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show.""  And for people who think working at The Abbey is just like any ole bartending or serving gig, they may not realize that it takes special qualities to succeed at a popular Los Angeles hotspot. VIP Host Murray Swanby [pictured below] said it's all about bringing conversation and personality to each guest.  ""A good VIP host has to be very social and very personable. You have to be able to hold a good conversation with somebody easily – that's probably the most important thing. Our job is to meet everybody coming in the door and being able to carry on a conversation with them,"" Swanby told TooFab.  NBC  “I think the cool part about The Abbey is I think for people that watch E! is that you can come in, and you're sitting next to a celebrity, doing shots and you rub elbows with celebrities here. They come here because they want to party, it's the party they want to go to,"" said Guliani.  “A gay neighborhood becomes a straight neighborhood; everybody mixes together because that's where the world is. You don't have to go a gay bar – everybody goes everywhere and that's great. The Abbey is the world greatest gay bar, there's no doubt about it… but it's very accepting of everybody.”  ""What Happens At The Abbey"" airs this Sunday at 10/9c on E!",real
3619,"Are the Kardashian sisters in for some double trouble?  Kourtney Kardashian might have a scandal of her to deal with own amidst her sister Khloe Kardashian’s cheating baby daddy drama.  Younes Bendjima, 24, who has been dating the oldest of the Kardashian sisters since 2016, was seen out with another woman April 9.  While Kourtney was with Kim on a vacation in Turks and Caicos, Younes was spotted talking and laughing with the brunette beauty, who has been identified as Leonardo DiCaprio’s girlfriend Camila Morrone, 20, according to The Daily Mail.  Instagram  The two could be seen having a casual and fairly lengthy conversation in West Hollywood Monday night before hugging and going their separate ways.  The Kardashian’s Algerian hunk and DiCaprio’s much younger girlfriend, who is much closer in age to Younes, are just friends, a source told the outlet.  Camila sported a bare face and black outfit with white boots while Younes was wearing a simple black tee and jeans.  Kourtney and her young boo seem to be very in love and post about each other all over social media. In one photo, she is sitting on Younes’ lap and dressed in nothing but Calvin Clines undergarments and a pair of unbuttoned jeans.  Interestingly enough, though, The Daily Mail reports that Kourtney posted some thought-provoking quotes that may hint she and Younes are not the picture-perfect couple they seem to be.  “I loved and that was a reward in itself,” she posted. The quote was credited to an Anthony Jones.  Later that day Kourtney posted, “All I want is something real,” a quote from Faraway.  Uh-oh. Could there be trouble in paradise while Kourtney is literally in paradise?  Kourtney and Younes have not addressed the photos yet.  Instagram  The Kardashian sisters seem to be drawn to cheaters, but hopefully, Kourtney has nothing to worry about.  The reality tv star previously had a rough on-and-off-again relationship with Scott Disick, 34, until they split up for good in 2015.  The exes had three children together, Mason 8, Penelope 5, Reign 3, whom they currently co-parent.  Scott and Kourtney’s relationship was bound to end badly as he cheated on her and struggled with many issues, including alcoholism.  Getty Images  Drama seems to follow the Kardashians and Jenners around and Scott and Kourtney’s ended relationship is no exception.  Scott was not exactly thrilled when he found out she was dating a younger and hotter guy. In an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Kourtney discussed how Scott was jealous of Younes and was not able to move on.  Though it looks like Kourtney has found true love, some fans think the Kardashian sisters may be in for some double trouble after Younes’ “mystery woman.”  The photos of Younes out and about with Camila come as Khloe’s boyfriend and father of her unborn baby was exposed for cheating on the KUWTK star, as YourTango previously reported.  Instagram  Tristan was caught kissing two women, including a Kardashian clone named Lani Blair, in photos leaked just days before he and Khloe prepare to welcome their first baby.  A sex tape involving the Cleveland Cavalier, who left his previous girlfriend while she was pregnant, broke the Internet this week as well.  None of the Kardashian family nor Thompson has yet to comment on the cheating rumors.",fake
1419,"Tom Cruise | Angela Weiss/Getty Images Tom Cruise | Angela Weiss/Getty Images  There have been a number of rumors over the years about Tom Cruise’s love life. The Mission Impossible star has kept sort of a low profile with his relationships after splitting from his ex-wife, Katie Holmes, in 2012. Therefore, because he isn’t jumping on couches and declaring his love for anyone, some tabloids have decided to make up stories about him being romantically involved with other Hollywood A-listers.  Now, it’s time to separate fact from fiction and bust those rumors about who Cruise has dated.  Angelina Jolie  In March 2017, the National Enquirer published a bogus report that the actor was dating Angelina Jolie.  The publication claimed that the two stars met to talk about the film they were working on together, however, we know that they never did a movie together so that part isn’t true. The outlet went on to claim that Jolie was enjoying making her ex, Brad Pitt, jealous about the romance. But Gossip Cop reported that there’s no truth to that, which makes sense since Jolie told People that dating is the furthest thing from her mind and something she doesn’t plan on doing for a long time.  Jane Fonda  After appearing together at Comic-Con in Las Vegas in spring 2018 to promote their movies, the site New Idea falsely reported that Cruise was seeing Jane Fonda.  The Book Club star ended up debunking this rumor herself during an interview with Extra when she said, “I’m not dating anymore, but I did up until a couple of years ago … I’ve closed up shop down there!”  Vanessa Kirby  There were wild reports, which surfaced in October 2017, that The Crown actress Vanessa Kirby was marrying, yes marrying, her Mission Impossible — Fallout co-star.  The story was published by not one, but two tabloids and totally caught Kirby by surprise. “The most disconcerting thing was the people I didn’t think would believe it did, and they were texting my boyfriend, asking, ‘Are you OK?'” she told Marie Claire. “I don’t think they believe anything they read now because you just can’t. None of it is real. To be getting married to him? Not even a snog—it was marriage.”  Elisabeth Moss  In November 2017, another article from the National Enquirer was debunked after it claimed that Cruise was romancing Elisabeth Moss. There was no evidence whatsoever to support this story and it may only have come out because the two Scientologists were both single at the time.  Moss though made it clear that to Marie Claire that the report was false and said she has “no time for dating,” adding, “It’s actually a problem. But I’m very focused on my work.”  Katie Holmes  Finally, in November 2016, the website called Headlines & Global News did a story that Cruise’s former wife had dumped her beau, Jamie Foxx, to get back together with him.  Of course, time has proven that to be untrue and despite not wanting to talk about their relationship Holmes and Foxx are still going strong. Whenever split rumors do make the rounds, they just leave it to their reps to deny.",fake
4595,"The first thing you’ll notice about the Dark Knight in Batman v. Superman, the second installation of the newly re-launched DC Universe, is that he’s gotten bigger in stature, muscle, and armor. The next? He’s also badder—gruff, aggressive, and the kind of character willing to square up to the Man of Steel. Given this, you might miss the third fact, that Batman — or at least Ben Affleck, the actor playing him—is also, well, middle-aged.  “I knew that a big part of the audience’s expectation around the role would be how I looked physically,” Affleck, 43, tells Men’s Journal over email. “And that was something I had some control over. If I was going to fail in this role, I wasn’t going to let it be in a way that could have been prevented if I had worked harder.” Director Zack Snyder believes that he got the job done, recently voicing his approval of Affleck’s portrayal as the iconic character, in both of his personas: “He’s an amazing Bruce Wayne, let’s just be frank about that. And then when he puts the cowl on, you know he’s got the chin for it.”  Affleck accomplished the proper frame with help from longtime trainer Walter Norton Jr., of the Institute of Performance and Fitness, who he began training with through a mutual friend during his fitness preparation for 2010’s The Town. Based in Boston, Norton makes almost weekly flights between his hometown and wherever Affleck is, whether it’s in Los Angeles or on location. “Getting ready for this role meant working hard, day in and day out with Walter,” says Affleck. “But it was the kind of work where I felt gains in not only my size, but also my mental and physical health.”  There are benefits of having history with a trainer. “Seven years ago the body bounced back a little quicker,” says Norton. “Like any relationship, it’s all about communication and honesty. I can tell him a little something that he doesn’t want to hear and that’s fine. We’re not tiptoeing around issues. So we just addressed it right at the top. We did what we needed to do to take care of him and protect his joints.”  But that does not mean that Affleck had it easy. Every week Norton created a new regime for him with specific goals, targeting each muscle group relentlessly, and with that mentality they found themselves even overachieving their target numbers. In context, Affleck weighed in at 198 pounds for The Town, and for Batman V. Superman, he went all the way to 231 at 7.7 percent body fat, which they ended up “dialing back” to 225. “This time around we did more bodybuilding. We wanted him to be strong but we wanted to add mass. The volume was higher. We lived on a lot of the basics, 80-pound dumbbell curls, heavy-loaded carries, and farmers walks with 60-pound weights.”  Affleck needed that extra strength on set: The batsuit weighs some 75 pounds. There are also plenty of workout scenes making their way into the final cut, showing off his ripped physique, like one he shot in the Batcave doing pull-ups, while strapped to an additional 50 pounds in weight. “If I had to say there were any critical exercises that we always went back to, it was pull-ups and chin-ups.”  “We wanted him to look like a thick MMA heavyweight puncher,” explains Norton. “This is a Bruce Wayne who’s been lifting for 20 years, hitting that heavyweight bag, and working out every day in the manor. I’ll just say that if you lined up all the Batmans before Ben and stood them next to each other, they’re not 6’4”, and they don’t weigh 225 pounds. He’s in a whole other class.”  Here’s a two-day glimpse at the workouts Norton created for Affleck as part of their two-year training program. You might not want to try this one on your own, though. “I recommend that people find a trainer who they get along with, create their own program suiting their own goals, and if they approach it with the same enthusiasm that Ben did, they can also make gains like a hero.”  Day 1:  Block 1 (32 minutes): Warm-up & Movement  Elliptical (Strength Program): 15 minutes  Rumble Roller (Hip/TFL/VMO/2 Way Glute/Calf): 9 minutes  Plank with Arm Extension: 10 seconds (then 8 reps of 2-second extension for each side)  Spiderman: From a plank, bring you right foot next to your right hand. 3 reps for each side (hold for 2 breaths)  Inchworm: From touching your toes with straight legs, walk your hands out to a plank, then walk your feet back under you, 5 reps (hold for 1 breath)  Calf Stretch: 15 seconds (each leg)  Block 2 (40 minutes): Torso & Strength  Dumbbell Farmer’s Walk: 4 walks with appropriate weight for 1 minute  Alternating Hanging Knee-Up: 11 reps (for each leg)  ½ Kneeling Row: Kneel on your right knee in front of a cable machine, row with your right arm, 4 sets of 12 reps on each side  Back Bridge: 2 reps of 15 second hold (5-second pause between)  Alternating Dumbbell Reverse Lunge: 8 reps (for each leg)  Pull-Up: 6 sets of 4 reps (hold for 4 seconds up and 4 seconds down)  Shoulder Bridge: 10-second hold (then 8 reps of 2-second extension for each side)  Block 3 (22 minutes / Doing As Many Sets As Possible): Strength & Fitness  Airdyne Bike Sprint: 20 seconds  V-Grip Pulldown: 15 reps  Seated Row Handle Grip: 12 reps  Alternating Dumbbell Open Curl: 5 sets of 5 reps (each arm, then 5 reps together)  Goblet Squat: 8 reps  Lateral Squat: 6 reps (each side)  Day 2:  Block 1 (30 minutes): Warm-up & Movement  Airdyne Bike Sprint: 10 reps of 5 minutes at 75% (finish with 15-second sprint, then 45-second rest)    Soft Roller (Upper Back/Lat/Quad/Glute/Ham Junction): 8 minutes  Brettzel Stretch : 2 reps for each side (hold for 5 breaths)  Kneeling Lat: 1 rep each side (hold for 5 breaths)  ½ Kneeling Quad Stretch: 2 reps for each side (hold for 5 breaths)  Brettzel: 2 reps for each side (hold for 5 breaths)  Block 2 (32 minutes): Torso & Strength  Off-Bench Oblique Side Crunch: 8 reps dynamic (followed with hold for 8 seconds)  Valslide Body Slide: 4 sets of 12 reps  Dumbbell Lateral Raise: 4 sets of 12 reps  Back Bridge with March: Hold bridge for 8 seconds (then 4 knee raises on each leg)  Dumbbell Shrug: 5 sets of 6 reps  Rear Delt Machine: 4 sets of 15 reps  1 Leg Hip Lift : 3 sets of 8 reps for each side (hold for 2 seconds)  Tricep Pushdown: 4 sets of 10 heavy reps, then 10 lighter reps  Block 3 (36 minutes): Strength  Dumbbell Deadlift: 4 sets of 6 reps  Dumbbell Bench Press: 4 sets of 10 reps (count 3 seconds from up to down position)  Pec Fly: 4 sets of 12 reps  Ball Leg Curl: 4 sets of 6 reps (hold for 2 seconds)  Batman v Superman is in theaters March 25, 2016.  https://youtube.com/watch?v=fis-9Zqu2Ro%3Frel%3D0%26controls%3D0%26showinfo%3D0  For access to exclusive gear videos, celebrity interviews, and more, subscribe on YouTube!",fake
230,"It’s hard to imagine Jennifer Aniston having a sit-down with Angelina Jolie — who Aniston’s then-husband Brad Pitt fell for while they filmed “Mr. and Mrs. Smith” together. But while Aniston may have played a similar role in the breakup of Justin Theroux and his girlfriend of 14 years, Aniston specifically requested a meeting to clear the air with her boyfriend’s ex, reports say.  According to Grazia magazine, Aniston had a “tearful” meeting with Theroux’s ex, stylist Heidi Bivens, at the Mercer Hotel last week. The two had a glass of wine as they spoke, sources say. Theroux was nowhere in sight.  “Jen has always been sympathetic to Heidi because she’s heard from Justin just how devastated she is about their break-up,” a source told the magazine. “Jen told Heidi that she understands what a painful time she has been going through and explained that she wanted her to know, hand on heart, that she would never steal another woman’s man.”  Aniston and Theroux met while filming “Wanderlust” in Georgia last fall, a comedy about a couple how moves to a rural commune when they find themselves unemployed. The two became close on set, but Theroux was still with Bivens at the time. Aniston and Theroux weren’t seen together again until March, when they both attended a dinner at the Chateau Marmont with friends.  JENNIFER ANISTON NOT PREGNANT, EXPECTING  JUSTIN AND JENNIFER’S LINGERIE SPREE  The couple wasn’t romatically linked until late May, and when the two were photographed together for the first time in early June, Bivens’ mother denied that her daughter and Theroux had split. But a week later, Bivens’ rep confirmed to Page Six that the couple had broken up. “She just moved out of their home last weekend,” the rep said. “She has no comment.” Sources said Bivens was “heartbroken” and “blindsided.”  According to Grazia, Aniston wanted to make it clear to Bivens that her relationship with Theroux started no earlier than May and that she is not a “homewrecker.”  “Jen has always been adamant that their relationships did not cross over,” a source tells the magazine. “Heidi apparently got quite tearful during the meeting, as it was understandably a lot of take in.”  Bivens has been called a “super-stylist” by Web site Refinery 29. She has styled videos for Kanye West, The White Stripes and Charlotte Gainsbourg and has worked for Details and Vogue.  Aniston’s relationship with Theroux has progressed quickly since the summer. But Aniston recently cleared up rumors that she’d have big news soon. “Rumor number one: I am not planning to get married any time soon. I’ve been married once, and I don’t know if I’ll get married again. But I can tell you that as of this very moment, I have no plan to get married. Got that?” she said. “And rumor number two: no, we’re not pregnant.”",fake

5716,"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)  Mel B has won a five-year restraining order against her former nanny Lorraine Gilles who claims she enjoyed a seven year sexual relationship with the star.  The former Spice Girl — who is locked in a bitter divorce with her estranged husband Stephen Belafonte — sought the order after she alleged Gilles, 25, and husband had an affair behind her back which led to the nanny getting an abortion which she paid for.  Requesting a temporary restraining order Mel had already obtained against Gilles be extended, her lawyer Larry Bakman told Van Nuys court in Los Angeles he had presented evidence which showed a pattern of harassing and annoying behaviour from the nanny.  He told the judge: “There were a number of incidents over a matter of time all designed to harass and annoy my client.”  Neither Mel B or Gilles were present in court. Gilles also had no lawyer representing her at the hearing.  Bakman said he had presented six pieces of evidence and a sworn declaration from the singer which were taken into consideration by judge Shirley Watkins.  Judge Watkins ruled: “Miss Brown has need for a restraining order for Miss Gilles. The court will issue a personal and stay away order as requested.”  The ruling means Gilles must not harass Mel and must stay at least 100 yards clear of her — it now extends until midnight on May 3, 2022.  Last month Mel’s legal team got a temporary restraining order on Gilles to gain access to a storage locker Mel claimed contained sex tapes and photos.  The star claimed Gilles and Belafonte had threatened to make them public in an effort to destroy her reputation.  The storage locker was briefly touched on in Wednesday’s hearing with Bakman revealing they were now aware of more than one storage facility.  After the hearing he told The Sun: “There are other storage units that we are aware of but we have not obtained an order to get into those.  “We are attempting to work that out with the opposing counsel.”  He also confirmed the singer had not been able to get “what she needed” from the original storage unit.  He added: “At this point we are attempting to resolve the issue formally with Mr Belafonte’s attorney.”  Mel filed for divorce from Belafonte in March and then went on to file a restraining order against her estranged husband.  The ex-Spice Girl alleges a catalog of physical abuse and claimed Belafonte impregnated Gilles during their marriage.  She also claims he taped threesomes they had with other women and has been using the tapes to extort her. She alleged the tapes are being kept in a storage locker which only he and nanny Gilles have access to.  Belafonte’s lawyer Grace Jamra has previously said: “It will be clear to everyone that there are no sex tapes in the storage … [Gilles] had nothing to do with the storage facility. In fact, Ms. Brown terminated Lorraine before the items were placed in storage.”  Gilles, who once looked after the singer’s children Phoenix, 18, Angel, 10, and Madison, 5, sued Mel for defamation last month.  In it the former nanny, who is now married to Michael Bleau, alleges Mel knew about her relationship with Belafonte and instigated threesomes with them both.",real

4872,"E!’s hit show, The Arrangement has aired two of its episodes from the second season, and from the looks of it, the drama is just getting started! Check out the recaps of episodes 1 and 2 below!  Episode 1 – “The Long Game” Recap from 3/11/2018  In the first episode of season 2, viewers are brought back to a seemingly happy Megan Morrison (Christine Evangelista) as she and her fiancé Kyle West (Josh Henderson) attend their engagement party. Not all is as it seems though, as Megan continues to have flashbacks to her horrible time in the Institute. That’s the Institute for the Higher Mind – you know, the place that Kyle’s mentor Terence (Michael Vartan) founded.  Megan’s flashbacks and way of “faking it” in all aspects of life have led to rifts in her relationships with Kyle and her agent Leslie (Autumn Reeser). Yet she continues her plan to take down the Institute, with the help of her friend Shaun (Carra Patterson) – because sometimes, the only way to take something down, is to take it over from the inside.  The Arrangment Episode 1 Photos          Episode 2 – “Surface Tension” Recap from 3/18/2018  In the second episode, there’s another red carpet and even more drama as Megan collapses during the event. But who’s – or what’s – to blame? Kyle’s insistent that it’s not drugs; but Terence seems to be indifferent. Could he somehow be involved? It wouldn’t be that far of a stretch considering the hold he already has over Kyle. I wonder if DeAnn (Lexa Doig) will ever draw a line between the two of them before it gets out of hand.  Kyle’s movie on the other hand, has one kind of issue: his worries about being a first-time director. Kyle reveals to Megan that he’s unsure of who he is as a director, since he’s always been “hiding behind characters.” He doesn’t know how to feel about being so exposed. So what will all this mean for ‘Technicolor Highway?’ Guess we’ll have to wait and see!  The Arrangement Episode 2 Photos  Episode 3 – “The Sessions” Recap from 3/25/18  In this episode, Megan (Christine Evangelista) and Terence (Michael Vartan) seem to grow closer during their one-on-one sessions. During their first meeting, they delve into their pasts. Well, actually Terence does most of the talking, while Megan’s the one prying him with questions. She’s pulling a “Terence” on Terence himself!  The second meeting sees them acting way more casual, almost like they’re friends or oddly close pals. These meetings are obviously limiting Megan’s time with Kyle, and that can’t be good given their track record this season alone. Megan’s always with Terence, while Kyle takes his lead actor, Xavier (Ruffin Prentiss) under his wing.  We all know that Kyle just wants his first movie to be great, but how far will he go to make sure that happens? He seems to be very “on edge” in this episode – which has led to yet another argument between he and Megan. Megan thinks Kyle’s “projecting his fears” onto her by not trusting her with this movie role; he thinks she’s wrong. Never fear though, KyGan fans: they do make up. And Megan gave a killer performance her first day on set, I might add.  One relationship that’s being further torn apart? Terence and DeAnn. Terence’s time is being taken up by Megan and Shaun (Carra Patterson); while DeAnn (Lexa Doig) makes a decision regarding her affair with Mason (Garcelle Beauvais). But when DeAnn calls Mason to tell her the news, she receives some devastating news. But what exactly happened to Mason? Guess we’ll have to wait and see!  The Arrangement Episode 3 Photos  Episode 4 – “Scene 23” Recap from 4/1/18  There’s tons of romance and revelations in this latest episode. You see Terence and DeAnn finally taking strides in their marriage as well as Kyle and Megan opening up to one another. Then it gets passionate as the vision Kyle has for “Technicolor Highway” being brought to life. All while the ratings are starting to come in for his latest film, “The Kill Plan.” Add in a new and old character and there you have episode 4 of “The Arrangement.”  Let’s start with Terence and DeAnn. They seem to be on the same page now in terms of what they want: a child! Can you believe it? Well, they sealed the deal, and they seem happy with their life right now. On the other side of things, DeAnn finally met her lover’s son, Wes (played by newcomer Jacob Artist). Mason has unfortunately passed, and DeAnn has a hard time dealing with it. Wes comes into play to help her talk through it and be there for her. Things get a little weird though when he kisses DeAnn. Oops.  Kyle’s got quite the duality going on right now: his latest film, “The Kill Plan” is released to the fans, but critics aren’t having it. It’s sinking fast, and it causes Kyle to lose focus on his current project, “Technicolor Highway.” Good thing Megan is there to help calm him. They finally get honest with each other on set and things seem better for them. Plus, Megan performs a killer scene for Kyle’s movie, so it’s a win-win!  As for the old character that comes back? Hope (Katharine Isabelle) – Megan’s ex-friend. Megan asks Hope to meet with her because she believes Hope can get her more dirt on the Institute. Shaun doesn’t approve, but Megan goes along with it anyway. Bad thing is, nothing pans out from Hope’s tip. At least, not yet. Speaking of Shaun, she’s been a bit preoccupied with Terence lately….well, his seminar, that is. Shaun strips down (literally and figuratively) and shows a side of herself viewers haven’t seen before. Makes for an interesting scene – definitely a standout.  So will Megan finally get the dirt she needs to bring IHM down? And what about this Wes character? Will DeAnn have even more drama in her life? And what about Kyle’s movie, will it keep running smoothly? Tune in next week to find out.  The Arrangement Episode 4 Photos  Episode 5 – “You Are Not Alone” Recap from 4/8/18  This episode has so many plots for each character or relationship, it’s hard to keep track! First up: Kyle and Megan meet with Terence and DeAnn at a party, where all seems romantic for each couple. Although, according to DeAnn, “marriage is just temporary…a negotiation.” Megan and Kyle don’t ever want to end up like that, but a rumor rocks their world and makes them question each other. Apparently, tabloids have reported that “Kygan” is fake, and that Megan is in love with her co-star, Xavier. Both of which aren’t true, but you know how it is in Hollywood. Causing even more tension for Kygan is the fact that Megan’s been trying to convince Kyle that Terence has just been riding his coattails. Kyle still feels as though he owes Terence for making him what he is, so it’s difficult for him to get out of Terence’s control.  Speaking of control, Terence feels like he’s losing it with DeAnn. You’ve got DeAnn admitting her past with Mason (DeAnn’s ex-girlfriend), which leaves Terence angry that DeAnn has such a love for her instead of him. Terence and DeAnn are hitting a wall, Terence is not able to get a handle on Megan, and Terence is losing grip on Kyle because of Megan. Sounds like things aren’t good for Terence right now. One thing though that keeps coming around is Shaun. I don’t know if their relationship is going to go past professional or not, but if it does, could Megan’s plan for IHM’s takedown be on the line? And what does Xavier supposedly being in love with Megan mean for Kyle’s movie? Can Terence and DeAnn finally pull themselves together enough to bring a kid into the world?  The Arrangement Episode 5 Photos  Episode 6 – “The Break Up” Recap from 4/15/18  This episode is special in a number of ways. First, you’ve got the start of it with a flashback to Kyle’s relationship with Lisbeth. Viewers see Kyle pacing back and forth, trying to get in contact with his then-girlfriend, only to find that she’s left him because “she got lost in his world.” Then we’re brought back to the present day, where the flashback connects to Kyle talking about how his failed relationship relates to his parents’ deaths (his mother from cancer and his father in a car accident). You’ve got Kyle feeling on edge because of this interview he’s conducting for IHM and because his movie isn’t going as well as he’d like. Terence isn’t helping the situation by spewing his “give IHM energy and it’ll give it back to you” advice – and you can see that the relationship between he and Kyle is strained.  Meanwhile, you’ve got Kyle and Xavier in some weird competition to see who’s the best, or who is right and wrong. This leads to Kyle and Megan fighting, as well as Kyle being jealous over Megan and Xavier spending time together. Viewers then get a look, presumably inside Kyle’s head, as to why he feels this way: his arguments with Lisbeth over her last relationship with Gavin. You see a whole new side of Kyle that’s dark and full of rage. We then cut to Megan’s interview, where she seems to be all happy-go-lucky and sings the Institute’s praises (as does her movie co-star, Xavier). Beneath the surface though, you can tell she wants to expose Terence, which is where Shaun came in to try and find info on the Institute. Yet there’s no such animal (or so it seems), which leaves Megan internally frustrated.  Probably one of the most jarring scenes is Kyle on his motorbike interspersed with flashbacks to his – surprise! – drug addiction. This ultimately led to a showdown between Kyle and Terence, that involved a gun. We see that Kyle was desperate and felt unloved, but Terence managed to talk him down. Another intense scene? A flashback from Terence’s POV showed that he and Lisbeth were together – while she was still engaged to Kyle! They hooked up, and Terence even admitted to being in love with her for a long while. After their escapade, Terence goes to see Kyle and gets him to go to the Facility. What’s crazy about this episode though is that during Kyle’s interview about IHM, he sounds like a robot, repeating word for word what Terence told him about why he needed to go to the Facility. The episode closes with Kyle firing Xavier and Kyle thinking that he’s got it all figured out. Little does he know, things haven’t even begun to go down.  The Arrangement Episode 6 Photos  Episode 7 – “On Location” Recap from 4/22/18  We start out with seeing the Kyle has in fact taken Xavier’s part in “Technicolor Highway”, alongside his fiancé Megan. Then, Megan goes into an audition where she runs into her former agent, Leslie. Leslie tries to see through to Megan’s real being, but she misses the mark when Megan puts up her “everything is fine” wall. As for her audition? Megan didn’t get the part, and it’s all because the director didn’t want IHM to bring drama to her set. In the first twist of the episode, the real reason Megan didn’t get the part? Her team at Creative Partners pulled her out of the running! This revelation causes a huge fight between Megan and Kyle, because Kyle knew about the “non-compete” agreement in the contract, but didn’t inform Megan.  They eventually make up by finally telling each other the truth about the contract…. or so they thought. Turns out Kyle lied about the real reason behind the contract, per Terence’s coaching. It’s insane how much control he has over their whole relationship.  Another obstacle occurs when Kyle (along with half the crew) get food poisoning. Since he’s unable to direct, it’s up to DeAnn and Megan to make sure his vision stays alive. DeAnn even gets Leslie to help out since they’re so short on camera assistants! DeAnn eventually listens to Leslie’s advice, and it seems as though they finish the scene without any more disasters. A toast by the fireside and they (Leslie, DeAnn and Megan) leave all their issues behind.  Back in LA, Shaun and Terence are still buddy-buddy, except for the fact that Terence is being sneaky with meetings and Shaun is lying to Zach about finding one of the victims of IHM’s Facility. Terence is still trying to pitch this new idea of a “magic potion” that supposedly gives this promise of immortality. He’s even going the extra mile as to dig up dirt on investors in order to get them to sign off! The episode ends with Kyle and Megan truthfully making up when Megan spills that she wouldn’t sign the contract if asked again. And Terence tells Shaun that he “loves” that she’s completely herself…. just as she breaks into the IHM database to find out where Julie Woolth (one of the IHM victims) is hiding. So, will Shaun be able to really help Megan? And what about Terence – will his reign over Kyle’s life be broken down? Or will Kyle continue to follow his lead?  The Arrangement Episode 7 Photos  Episode 8 – “Paso Robles” Recap from 4/29/18  This episode is full of untold truths and so much drama. First, Kyle runs into Detective Gaffey – if you remember, he slept with her per Terence’s convincing to keep things quiet regarding the IHM investigation – while Megan is right there. Talk about awkward. Also odd? The fact that Kyle then keeps having a recurring nightmare about someone trying to kill him. He seems to think it’s related to Detective Gaffey, but Terence seems to think it’s about “someone close betraying him.” Which is it: a guilty conscience or a sign that something else is wrong?  Meanwhile, Megan and Shaun go to Paso Robles, aka: “wine country” under the guise of her bachelorette party; when in reality, they’re going to investigate Julie Woolth. When they meet her, she seems all too happy about her experience with IHM. But Megan doesn’t seem to buy her story. Another story that might not be bought? Zach’s reason for using a burner phone! Kyle caught him talking about “Julie” but Zach lies to him and Terence about who Julie is. Since Zach was really talking to Megan, she’s freaking out because she assumes that Terence is going to find out the truth and ruin her.  In the biggest bombshell of the night, Julie’s brother Aaron tells Megan the truth about IHM. Yes, the payments they got from Terence were hush money; but Kyle was the one who put Aaron in the wheelchair. He lost his ability to walk because Kyle lost out to a part in a movie. Terence covered it all up in his own twisted version of an “arrangement.” What will this mean for Megan and Kyle? And what about Terence: will this be enough to finally take him down?

A source told People magazine: ""She felt like she needed to get away and focus on herself with no distractions. She came back feeling very empowered. She wants to go again later this year. She feels and looks great. She's still working on new music and is excited about it. After all the noise that happened over the holidays, she felt like she needed this.""  Meanwhile, Selena previously revealed she is constantly trying to reinvent herself and feels the need to want to ""grow"" and get stronger all the time.

4513,"Trouble in paradise? Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes were first spotted dancing together in the Hamptons in 2013 — just one year after she split from Tom Cruise. Although Jamie and Katie have never confirmed their romance, they have been spotted on date nights and canoodling plenty of times over the past several years. But recently, tension has been high between them as Jamie is getting a bit jealous of Katie’s friendship with former flame Joshua Jackson.  The 50-year-old Sleepless star was overheard venting about his tumultuous relationship with Katie while hanging out at Coachella. “He didn’t seem to care who heard him,” the source exclusively told In Touch. Jamie admitted that not only was Katie talking to Joshua again, but he was also “hurt” by it.  It’s imprtant to note that Katie and Joshua go way back, which is why Jamie probably “seemed pretty cut up by everything.” The former Dawson’s Creek co-stars dated in the ’90s and Katie admitted during an interview with Rolling Stone in 1998 that Joshua was her first love.  When asked about their relationship, a then 19-year-old Katie said, “I’m just going to say that I met somebody last year, I fell in love, I had my first love, and it was something so incredible and indescribable.” She added, “I feel so fortunate because he’s now one of my best friends. It’s weird, it’s almost like a Dawson-and-Joey type thing now.”  The pair broke things off before Katie went on to date Chris Klein for five years before marrying Tom in 2006. However, Katie and Joshua have always kept in touch despite other relationships. Surprisingly, she reached out to Joshua following her split from Tom in 2012.  “Like any old friend, it was like, ‘Oh, hi, how are ya? What’s going on?’; ‘I had a kid,'” Joshua told a Canadian talk show host about the phone call with Katie. “It was very nice, actually.”  So, does Jamie have a reason to be worried? That’s a tricky question, but Jamie isn’t as innocent as he seems — because he’s been texting his ex, too! At the beginning of March, sources exclusively told In Touch that Katie is starting to suspect that Jamie and his baby mama Kristin Grannis are more than just friends. “She recently found out about a string of texts Jamie sent to Kristin that included details of secret meetings — and him admitting he still loved her,” the insider said. And Jamie’s latest act of betrayal is him showing “a blatant lack of respect.”",fake

17433,"Kelis, Nas' Ex-Wife, Accuses Rapper Of Physical And Mental Abuse  Enlarge this image toggle caption Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Spotify Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Spotify  For nearly a decade, singer and celebrity chef Kelis kept the details surrounding her divorce from the rap artist Nas private. But in a new video interview with Hollywood Unlocked, she describes their high-profile celebrity marriage of five years as a ""tumultuous and toxic"" relationship in which she suffered both mental and physical abuse.  ""I have edited myself for nine years and I woke up this morning and said, 'not today,' "" Kelis says during the nearly two-hour interview recorded at her home.  A representative for Nas did not respond to a request for comment.  YouTube  When the couple married in 2005, Nas's status as one of the greatest rappers alive and Kelis's genre-bending musical repertoire made them instant hip-hop royalty in the public eye. Yet the fairy-tale was far from reality, Kelis claims. She describes a marriage in which they fought frequently, with Nas often drinking to the point of being black-out drunk before becoming violent toward her. Kelis would fight back in self-defense, she says, and Nas would often wake up with no memory of the events. ""Literally, we would have the worst night ever and we would wake up the next day, and it's like it never happened.""  Her revelations come amid the backdrop of #MeToo, a movement whose greater reckoning around sexual assault, harassment and violence against women has yet to make a dent in hip-hop, despite its tangled, misogynist history. Russell Simmons, the godfather of the rap industry, has been the subject of multiple allegations of sexual assault and harassment over the past year; one of two assault cases filed against Simmons was dropped earlier this week. But the music industry, and hip-hop in particular, has yet to face the wide-scale scrutiny that has hit Hollywood head-on.  In one grim account, Kelis recalls feeling empathy for Rihanna when details emerged of her abuse at the hands of Chris Brown because she found herself in the same predicament. ""I remember so clearly when the pictures came out with that whole thing that happened with her and Chris Brown. And the only way I can describe it was like double-dutch. I felt like, 'Do I jump in? Do I say it?' Cause I had bruises all over my body at that time,"" she says. ""That day, I remember being in Atlanta sitting in the kitchen and I wasn't ready to walk.""  By the time she filed for divorce over ""irreconcilable differences"" in April 2009, Nas had been cheating for two years, she alleges, in addition to the domestic abuse. Pregnant with their son Knight at the time, she gave birth in July. In less than a year, their divorce was finalized.  On the cover photo of Nas' 2012 album Life Is Good, the artist is seated with part of his ex-wife's green wedding dress draped over his leg. It was left behind when they split, he said in interviews at the time of the album's release. Nas has never acknowledged physical abuse and has yet to respond publicly to Kelis's new allegations.  It's not the first time Nas has been the subject of such accusations. In her 2006 tell-all book It's No Secret, Carmen Bryan, the mother of Nas' daughter Destiny Jones, wrote: ""The next thing I knew I was being hit in the face with a closed fist,"" detailing what happened the morning after she came home and Nas noticed a hickey on her neck. ""The impact of the blow was so fierce that I saw stars.""  Kelis's interview comes in the wake of the latest filing by Nas in the protracted custody battle over their eight-year-old son, which provoked her to speak out, she says. ""I'm really private; I don't like people in my business,"" Kelis says, explaining why she stayed quiet during their marriage. ""I felt like, 'This is my partner; I chose this. We're gonna do this. We're gonna make it work.' I stayed for years after that, and you keep it moving. Like I said, I'm not frail, I'm not scared, I'm not weak.""",real

Magazine - Daily News Subscribe Thank you for subscribing See our privacy notice Invalid Email  (Image: Kylie Jenner/YouTube)  Keeping Up With The Kardashians star Kylie Jenner, 20, and her boyfriend Travis Scott have finally confirmed her pregnancy after she gives birth to a baby girl.  After months of speculation, Kim Kardashian West's youngest sister has released a 10 minute video detailing the pregnancy and the safe arrival of her healthy daughter.  The news comes following months of speculation and a Calvin Klein campaign by all the Kardashian sisters that had Kylie fans convinced once and for all she was expecting a child.  (Image: Kylie Jenner/YouTube) (Image: Kylie Jenner/YouTube)  Following the announcement that Khloe Kardashian is pregnant with her first baby with boyfriend Tristan Thompson, fans have been calling on the 20 year old to confirm the news, with some furious that she didn't confirm it in a recent KUWTK, when Khloe told her she was pregnant.  Here's everything you need to know about Kylie Jenner's rumoured pregnancy:  (Image: Kylie Jenner/YouTube) (Image: Twitter / RodeoTheAlbum)  Kylie and Travis split?  It was reported Kylie and Travis split in the last few months of her pregnancy but the baby clip - put together by close friends - tells a different story.  Showing Kylie and Travis completely loved up, and in the delivery room as she gave birth only days ago, the duo couldn't be happier.  Kylie Jenner's 'baby bump'  With her absence from social media, fans were on the look out for a baby bump and have even found an old social media video from the Golden Globes where they're convinced they can spot a baby bump.  Photos taken ""months ago"" from her friend's birthday party, also show Kylie in an oversized jumper, concealing her figure.  (Image: Twitter)  Kardashian Christmas card  After 24 days of snippets from the famous Kardashian Christmas card, fans were convinced day 25, Christmas Day, would be the big reveal.  However, Kylie was nowhere to be seen at all, leaving fans sure that Travis Scott's girlfriend was heavily pregnant.  Fans were still convinced a baby announcement was on the way after spotting a 'clue' in one of the Kardashian Christmas calendar photos.  Kris and Kourtney are among some of the family members looking off-camera, beaming happily at something - or someone.  One fan commented on Twitter: ""Half of the Christmas card are looking at something THEY’RE LOOKING AT KYLIE JENNER HOLDING THAT BABY IM TELLING U.""  Kris Jenner talks grandchildren  (Image: Getty)  During the upcoming Christmas special of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the mother-of-six revealed what she was most thankful for – and got very emotional.  ""I used to pray that one of you guys would have a baby and now it’s like a faucet that we turned on that won’t turn off,"" she confessed.  ""The fact that I have all these grandchildren… ""  Fans obviously couldn't help but make the connection following Kylie's pregnancy reports.  (Image: Getty)  Kylie Jenner baby shower speculation  In pictures obtained by The Sun, a marquee lined with pink curtains can be seen set up at the back of the 20 year old’s LA mansion, showing pink decorations filling the garden.  Pink objects appear to be floating in the pool, while matching cushions adorn the seating area, Kylie appeared in pink silk pyjamas, suggesting the baby shower was for herself and she is expecting a baby girl.  (Image: Kylie Jenner/Instagram)  Is this the moment Travis Scott found out?  Fans are convinced they know when Travis Scott found out the 'happy news' from Kylie, who has a huge net worth.  On June 12, the star cryptically tweeted: ""Legit the happiest day of my life.""  According to Perez Hilton this would coincide perfectly with the reported due date, and the pair went on to get a matching butterfly tattoo.  (Image: Twitter)  Due date  People magazine originally reported Kylie was due to give birth in February 2018.  A source said: “They started telling friends a few weeks ago. The family has known for quite some time. She is really excited and so is Travis!”  Another insider added: “It is an unexpected but completely amazing turn of events that she could not be more excited or thrilled about.  They added: “Everyone is overjoyed for her. This is the happiest she’s ever been.”  (Image: Kylie Jenner/Instagram)  (Image: Kylie Jenner/Snapchat)  Kylie Jenner to pick a unique baby name  Despite the 20 year old not confirming or denying her pregnancy, reports have already begun speculating about what Kylie would name her future child.  An alleged insider told Hollywood Life: ""She would like to do something both unique and keep the 'K' first name consistent with her sisters and mum.""  Fans thought she may have gone with the name Butterfly given she and Travis both have matching small butterfly tattoos on their ankles.  Kylie to QUIT social media  In December 2015 Kylie Jenner told Elle UK she would delete her account as soon as she has a child.  ""Once I have a kid I’m not going to be on Instagram,"" Kylie told the magazine. “You know, I’ll probably delete my Instagram and just… I don’t know, live life.”  (Image: Kylie Jenner / Instagram)  Kylie demands more privacy  According to People magazine, the reason Kylie is being so shy about the reports is because she wants more privacy.  A source told them: ""Kylie prefers to stay home. She feels good, but her body is changing. She doesn’t want to be photographed.  ""At the moment, she wants more privacy. She has family and friends come to her house instead so she has company.""",fake

937,"Lionsgate Kate McKinnon in ""The Spy Who Dumped Me.""  Consider this a call to arms. Kate McKinnon needs our help. You see, the “Saturday Night Live” MVP is the only full-time cast member in the show’s 43-year history to win two Emmys. From Bieber impressions to alien abductions, she is its deft quarterback, its kooky crown jewel, its melodic moral compass ― every bit as essential to the lineup as Kristen Wiig or Amy Poehler or Eddie Murphy or John Belushi. Why, then, on God’s sin-ridden earth, can no one write her a good movie role? Seeing as McKinnon is the best part of anything she’s in, it can be easy to forget she’s never had a good role. That’s because she’s, well, Kate McKinnon, able to elevate characters that otherwise coast on one-note hijinks. Often, they’re not so much characters as they are walking punch lines: the whimsical engineer in “Ghostbusters,” the buttoned-up HR coordinator in “Office Christmas Party,” the bossy redneck in “Masterminds,” the Australian madcap in “Rough Night” and now the adventurous unemployed actress in “The Spy Who Dumped Me.” All of these roles play out the same way. McKinnon is a sidekick to more established movie stars, introduced as the eccentric friend, wife or colleague with an odd collection of life experiences that act as a stand-in for character development. As Holtz in “Ghostbusters,” she’s a “gluten-full” skier who somehow put a physicist in a coma. As Pippa in “Rough Night,” she’s an animal whisperer who once perished and came back to life during a drug trip in the desert. As the buffoonish Jandice in “Masterminds,” her husband died from a snake bite; at his funeral, she fell in love with his “distant cousin.” And as Morgan in “The Spy Who Dumped Me,” her biography includes getting deported from Belize, doing cocaine with her basketball coach, being the target of Mandy Patinkin’s advances, discussing penis preferences with her mom and inviting a magician to live in her grandmother’s condo.  Lionsgate Kate McKinnon and Mila Kunis in ""The Spy Who Dumped Me.""  Instead of giving her characters depth, screenwriters give them anecdotes. McKinnon delivers lines like these matter-of-factly, as if anyone who doesn’t relate is a freak ― a convincing way to tap into the irony of her full-bodied ebullience. She plays walking scrapbooks overflowing with uproarious one-liners and wacky reaction shots, having become a go-to for nimble physical humor that evokes Lucille Ball, Jerry Lewis and Jim Carrey. But those performers’ manic verve had sell-by dates: Ball’s attempts to re-create the joys of “I Love Lucy” never quite worked, Paramount Pictures eventually declined to renew Lewis’ contract, and Carrey grew tired of being a tool for box-office capital. Or perhaps it’s more apt to compare McKinnon to her “SNL” predecessors. Take, for example, Will Ferrell, inarguably one of the biggest movie stars the sketch series has produced. Ferrell and McKinnon share a penchant for visceral oddballs, but a few things set them apart. First, Ferrell gets to headline movies, whereas McKinnon is always second fiddle. (The entire plot of “The Spy Who Dumped Me” revolves around Mila Kunis.) Secondly, Ferrell’s lead roles, however silly they may be, have proper arcs with family histories and detailed psychologies (see: “Elf,” “Talladega Nights,” “Step Brothers”). And finally, Ferrell ― like Kristen Wiig, Adam Sandler and Bill Murray ― has evidenced that he is more than a one-trick pony by taking astute roles in thoughtful character studies (see: “Stranger Than Fiction,” “Everything Must Go”). McKinnon, on the other hand, has so far been pigeonholed as little more than the resident nut job, tasked with making googly eyes or thinning her voice to steal scenes in unremarkable chaos comedies.  Sony Chris Hemsworth, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig in ""Ghostbusters.""  Sooner or later, that schtick runs thin for even the sharpest performers. Even Eddie Murphy, once a supreme movie star, descended from “Beverly Hills Cop” to “Daddy Day Care.” And McKinnon, like Murphy before her, is far too good for that. She deserves a part that doesn’t feel like an “SNL” bit pushed beyond its limits, where the musicality of her voice and the dementedness of her dexterity are more than devices for cheap chuckles. “The Spy Who Dumped Me,” directed and co-written by Susanna Fogel (“Life Partners”), is the ultimate example of this. In “Spy,” an action comedy with a third act that has far too much action and hardly enough comedy, Morgan is the daring BFF who can drop everything to delve into international assassin mayhem that really has nothing to do with her. Morgan doesn’t have much to offer the plot beyond aiding Kunis’ Audrey, so she enlists the help of onetime flame Edward Snowden to take down the crime syndicate that Audrey is wrapped up with. Like most of McKinnon’s big-screen characters, Morgan has an impressive sexual prowess, but it’s only evidenced with an implicit wink. She can’t have normal relationships, no way; she needs to have the world’s most famous dissident on speed dial. There’s a key moment in “Spy” that presents a unified theory of the Kate McKinnon Cinematic Universe. Speaking, rather rudely, for everyone who comes in contact with a feature-length McKinnon character, Audrey’s boyfriend (Justin Theroux) tells her she is “a little much.”  Sony Zoë Kravitz, Jillian Bell, Scarlett Johansson, Kate McKinnon and Ilana Glazer in ""Rough Night.""",fake
4200,"American television and film actress  Jennifer Joanna Aniston (born February 11, 1969) is an American actress, film producer, and businesswoman. The daughter of actors John Aniston and Nancy Dow, she began working as an actress at an early age with an uncredited role in the 1987 film Mac and Me. Her first major film role came in the 1993 horror comedy Leprechaun. Since her career grew in the early 1990s, Aniston has been one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood.  Aniston rose to international fame portraying Rachel Green on the television sitcom Friends (1994–2004), for which she earned Primetime Emmy, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild awards. The character became widely popular and was described as one of the greatest female characters in American television history. Aniston has since played starring roles in numerous dramas, comedies and romantic comedies. Her biggest box office successes include the films Bruce Almighty (2003), The Break-Up (2006), Marley & Me (2008), Just Go with It (2011), Horrible Bosses (2011), and We're the Millers (2013), each of which grossed over $200 million in worldwide box office receipts. Some of her most critically acclaimed film roles include Office Space (1999), The Good Girl (2002), Friends with Money (2006), Cake (2014), and Dumplin' (2018). She returned to television in 2019, producing and starring in the Apple TV+ drama series The Morning Show, for which she won another Screen Actors Guild Award.  Aniston has been included in numerous magazines' lists of the world's most beautiful women. Her net worth is estimated to be US$200 million. She is the recipient of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Aniston is also the co-founder of the production company Echo Films, established in 2008. Divorced from actor Brad Pitt, to whom she was married for five years, Aniston is separated from actor Justin Theroux, whom she married in 2015.  Early life  Aniston was born on February 11, 1969, in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Sherman Oaks,[4][5] the daughter of Greek-born actor John Aniston and actress Nancy Dow.[4] One of her maternal great-grandfathers, Louis Grieco, was from Italy.[6] Her mother's other ancestry includes English, Irish, Scottish, and a small amount of Greek.[7] Aniston has two half-brothers: John Melick, her older maternal half-brother, and Alex Aniston, her younger paternal half-brother.[4] Aniston's godfather was actor Telly Savalas, one of her father's best friends.[4][8]  As a child she moved to New York City.[4] Despite her father's television career she was discouraged from watching television, though she found ways around the prohibition. When she was six, she began attending a Waldorf school.[9] Her parents split up when she was nine years old.[10]  Having discovered acting at age 11 at the Waldorf school,[10] Aniston enrolled in Manhattan's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, where she joined the school's drama society;[11] Anthony Abeson was her drama teacher.[12] She performed in The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window by Lorraine Hansberry and Three Sisters by Anton Chekhov.[13]  Career  Beginnings (1988–1993)  Aniston first worked in Off-Broadway productions such as For Dear Life and Dancing on Checker's Grave,[4] and supported herself with part-time jobs which included working as a telemarketer, waitress, and bike messenger.[4] In 1988, she had an uncredited minor role in the critically panned sci-fi adventure film Mac and Me. The next year she appeared on The Howard Stern Show as a spokesmodel for Nutrisystem,[14] and moved back to Los Angeles.[15]  She obtained her first regular television role on Molloy in 1990, and appeared in Ferris Bueller, a television adaptation of the 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off; both series were quickly canceled. She starred as a teenager going to summer camp in the made-for-television film Camp Cucamonga (1990), and as a spoiled daughter followed by a vengeful leprechaun in the horror film Leprechaun (1993).[16] A 2014 retrospective from Entertainment Weekly identified Leprechaun as her worst role,[17] and Aniston herself has expressed embarrassment over it.[18]  Aniston also appeared in two more failed television comedy series, The Edge and Muddling Through,[19] and guest-starred in Quantum Leap, Herman's Head, and Burke's Law.[20][21]  Friends and breakout (1994–2004)  Depressed over her four unsuccessful television shows, Aniston approached Warren Littlefield at a Los Angeles gas station asking for reassurance. The head of NBC entertainment encouraged her to continue acting, and a few months later helped cast her for Friends,[22][19] a sitcom that was set to debut on NBC's 1994–1995 fall lineup. The producer originally wanted Aniston to audition for the role of Monica Geller,[23] but Courteney Cox was considered more suitable. Thus, Aniston was cast as Rachel Green. She was also offered a spot as a featured player on Saturday Night Live, but turned it down to do Friends.[24] She played Rachel until the show ended in 2004.  The program was successful and Aniston, along with her co-stars, gained worldwide recognition among television viewers. Her character was widely popular and was later recognized as one of the greatest female characters in American television.[25][26] The actress received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations (two for Supporting Actress, three for Lead Actress), including a win for Lead Actress.[27] She was also nominated for two Golden Globe Awards and won in 2003 as Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Aniston (along with her female co-stars) became the highest-paid television actress of all time with her $1 million-per-episode paycheck for the final season of Friends.[28] Her character's relationship with Ross Geller, portrayed by David Schwimmer in the show, was widely popular among audiences, and the couple was frequently voted as television's favorite couple in polls and magazines.[29]  Following a four-year hiatus, Aniston returned to film work in 1996, when she performed in the ensemble cast of romantic comedy She's the One.[30] Aniston's first starring vehicle was Picture Perfect (1997), in which she played a struggling young advertising executive opposite Kevin Bacon and Jay Mohr. While the film received mixed reviews, it was a moderate commercial success,[31] and Aniston's performance was more warmly received, with many critics suggesting that she had screen presence.[32] In 1998, she appeared as a woman who falls for a gay man (played by Paul Rudd) in the romantic comedy The Object of My Affection,[33] and the next year she starred as a restaurant waitress in the cult film Office Space.[34]  She starred in the independent dramedy The Good Girl (2002) as an unglamorous cashier who cheats on her husband. The film was a commercial success in limited release, taking in over $14 million in North America.[35] Film critic Roger Ebert declared it her breakthrough:  After languishing in a series of overlooked movies that ranged from the entertaining Office Space to the disposable Picture Perfect, Jennifer Aniston has at last decisively broken with her Friends image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil. It will no longer be possible to consider her in the same way.[36]  Aniston's biggest commercial success in film has been the comedy Bruce Almighty (2003), in which she played the girlfriend of a television field reporter (Jim Carrey) offered the chance to be God for one week.[37] With a worldwide box office gross of $484 million,[38][39] the film was the fifth-highest-grossing big screen production of the year.[40] Aniston next starred as the old classmate of a tightly-wound newly-wed in the romantic comedy Along Came Polly (2004), opposite Ben Stiller,[41] which placed number one at the North American box office, earning $27.7 million in its opening weekend;[42] it eventually made $172 million globally.[43]  Continued film success (2005–2013)  In 2005, Aniston appeared as an alluring woman having an affair with an advertising executive in the thriller Derailed, and as an obituary and wedding announcement writer in the romantic comedy Rumor Has It.[44][45] Both films were moderate box office hits.[46][47] Aniston took on the role of a single, cash-strapped woman working as a maid in the independent drama Friends with Money (2006), which received a limited release.[48]  Her next film was the romantic comedy The Break-Up (2006), alongside Vince Vaughn, in which she starred as one half of a couple having a complicated split when both refuse to move out of the pair's recently purchased home. It received mixed reviews but grossed approximately $39.17 million during its opening weekend and $204 million worldwide.[49] The A.V. Club's Keith Phipps gave the film a negative review, stating, ""It's like watching the 'we were on a break' episode of Friends stretched to feature length, and without the blessed relief of commercial breaks or the promise of Seinfeld around the corner.""[50] CinemaBlend gave the film a positive review stating, ""In an era of formulaic romantic movies that bear no resemblance to reality, The Break-Up offers a refreshing flipside.""[51]  In 2006, Aniston directed the short film Room 10, set in a hospital emergency room and starring Robin Wright and Kris Kristofferson, as part of Glamour's Reel Moments film series.[52] She noted that she was inspired to direct by actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who also directed a short film that year.[53] In 2007, Aniston guest-starred in an episode of Dirt—playing the rival of Courteney Cox's character[54]—and in an episode of 30 Rock, playing a woman who stalks Jack Donaghy.[55] For the latter she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination as Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.[56]  The 2005 comedy drama Marley & Me, with Aniston and Owen Wilson as the owners of the titular dog, set a record for the largest Christmas Day box office sales ever with $14.75 million. It earned a total of $51.7 million over the four-day weekend and placed number one at the box office, a position it maintained for two weeks.[57] The total worldwide gross was $242.7 million.[58] Her next film in wide release, the romantic comedy He's Just Not That into You (2009), in which she starred opposite Ben Affleck, grossed $178.8 million globally[59] and ranked number one at the United States box office for its opening weekend.[60] While it received mixed reviews, Aniston, along with Affleck, Ginnifer Goodwin, and Jennifer Connelly, were praised by critics as stand-outs in the film.[61][62]  Aniston appeared as the former wife of a bounty hunter (Gerard Butler) in the romantic comedy action film The Bounty Hunter (2010). The film was panned by critics, with The Hollywood Reporter writing that ""the mishmash ends up as a thoroughly unfunny adult cartoon.""[63] Nevertheless, it was a box office success, garnering over $130 million worldwide.[64] A lukewarm box office reception greeted her next film, the romantic comedy The Switch (2010), in which she starred with Jason Bateman as a 30-something single woman who decides to have a child using a sperm bank. The film's opening weekend drew what The Hollywood Reporter dubbed ""a dispiriting $8.4 million.""[65] The film received generally mixed reviews, with review site Metacritic showing 13 out of 30 critics delivering a positive verdict.[66]  In 2010, Aniston was also a guest star on the season two premiere of ABC's sitcom Cougar Town, playing a psychiatrist.[67] Her announcement that she would appear on Cougar Town garnered excitement and was dubbed her return to television. The A.V. Club wrote, ""[her role is] is a funny bit, and it highlights just how much Jennifer Aniston is built to be a TV star.""[68][69][70] In 2011, she starred opposite Adam Sandler as an office manager posing as the wife of a plastic surgeon in the romantic comedy Just Go with It,[71][72][73] and played a sexually aggressive dentist in Horrible Bosses.[74] Just Go with It and Horrible Bosses both made over $100 million in North America and $200 million worldwide.[75][76]  Aniston appeared in the comedy Wanderlust (2012) with Paul Rudd,[77] with whom she acted in The Object of My Affection and also Friends, as a married couple who join a commune after losing their money and deciding modern life is not for them.[78] The script for Wanderlust, bought by Universal Pictures,[79] was produced by Judd Apatow.[80][81] Wanderlust received positive reviews but was a box office failure, grossing only $21 million worldwide, against a production budget of $35 million.[82] Aniston starred as a struggling stripper who agrees to pose as a wife for a drug deal, with Jason Sudeikis, in We're the Millers (2013). The film received mixed reviews from critics,[83] but was a financial success, grossing $269 million against a budget of $37 million.[84]  Recent roles and return to television (2014–present)  Aniston played the role of a stoic socialite who becomes the target of an ill-planned kidnapping plot in Life of Crime (2014), a film adaptation of Elmore Leonard's 1978 novel The Switch.[85] The film was released in limited theaters, to positive reviews.[86] Catherine Shoard of The Guardian described her performance as ""endearingly comic""[87] and Eric Kohn of Indie Wire wrote that ""Aniston tops any of her recent performances with a spirited turn that harkens back to her neurotic days on Friends.""[88] She also reprised her role for Horrible Bosses 2 (2014).[89]  In Cake (2014), Aniston starred as an astringent woman named Claire Simmons who struggles with chronic pain.[90] The film received mixed reviews; however, Aniston's performance was highly praised, dubbed by some critics as ""Oscar-worthy.""[91][92][93][94] The Toronto International Film Festival called her performance ""heartbreakingly good"",[95] Gregory Ellwood of HitFix stated, ""It's really on most people's radar for being a rare dramatic turn for Jennifer Aniston, and she doesn't disappoint."" He further stated, ""Aniston makes you believe in Claire's pain. She makes you believe this character is at her lowest point and only she can pull herself out of it. ... It's a complete performance from beginning to end and she deserves the appropriate accolades for it.""[96] For her portrayal, Aniston was nominated for the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress, Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, and SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role.[97][98]  Horrible Bosses in 2011 Aniston at the London premiere ofin 2011  In 2015, Aniston starred as a reluctant therapist in the screwball comedy She's Funny That Way,[99] which received mixed reviews and found a limited release in theaters, but her performance was once again noticed. Wesley Morris of Grantland called her ""one of the great screen comedians. ... Most of her scenes here are extraneous, but her vulgarity and tartness are so sharp that the movie needs them. ... This isn't just Aniston having the best stuff. It's her having the most fun with her talent. She's funny in every way.""[100] She was ""one of the film's few bright spots"" for Lou Lumenick from The New York Post.[101]  Aniston starred as the recently divorced mother of two children in the romantic comedy Mother's Day (2016), directed by Garry Marshall, and opposite Julia Roberts and Kate Hudson.[102] The film was panned by critics and a moderate commercial success.[103] In 2016, she voiced a workaholic and overprotective mother in the animated film Storks, alongside Andy Samberg and Kelsey Grammer,[104] which was released to mostly positive reviews; it grossed over $183.4 million with a $70 million budget.[105][106] Her last 2016 film role was that of a frigidly cold head honcho of a company in the comedy Office Christmas Party, directed by Josh Gordon and Will Speck and opposite Jason Bateman and Kate McKinnon.[107] It made $114.5 million globally.[108]  In The Yellow Birds, a war drama directed by Alexandre Moors, Aniston portrays the mother of a deceased soldier, alongside Alden Ehrenreich, Tye Sheridan, Jack Huston, and Toni Collette.[109] While she said she does not ""normally gravitate toward being in war films"", she made an exception because the film was ""written so beautifully and in such a way [she] had never experienced"".[110] The film, first presented during the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, received a VOD release in June 2018.[111] The Los Angeles Times wrote in its review: ""Toni Collette and Jennifer Aniston as the soldiers' quite different but equally concerned mothers, deliver uniformly naturalistic performances"".[112]  In December 2018, Netflix released the musical comedy Dumplin', with Aniston as executive producer and star—marking her first project for a streaming service.[113] That year, she began work on two more Netflix projects: Murder Mystery, a comedy that reunites her with Adam Sandler, which premiered on June 14, 2019;[114] and First Ladies, a film about the first lesbian President of the United States, with Tig Notaro as her wife.[115]  Aniston made her return to television on November 1, 2019, producing and starring alongside Reese Witherspoon in the Apple TV+ drama The Morning Show. It is her first main television role since the conclusion of Friends in 2004.[116] Aniston won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series, and was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress – Television Series Drama and Best Television Series – Drama as the series' producer.[117][118]  Other ventures  Aniston has appeared in commercials and music videos throughout her career. After starting on Friends, Aniston and her co-star Matthew Perry shot a 60-minute instructional video for the release of Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system.[119] The next year she appeared in commercials for L'Oréal hair products.[120]  Under a contract with Elizabeth Arden, Inc.,[121] Aniston worked for over a year on her first perfume, which was released in July 2010.[122][123] Original plans called for the perfume to be named ""Lolavie by Jennifer Aniston"", but to avoid confusion with a similarly named perfume, the name was changed to simply ""Jennifer Aniston"".[124] In 2014, she launched her second perfume, named J,[125][126] followed by Near Dusk (2015),[121] Beachscape (2016),[127] Luxe and Chapter One (both in 2017).[128][129]  Since 2007, she has worked in a publicity campaign for the drink SmartWater; on March 7, 2011, she released a YouTube video for SmartWater, Jennifer Aniston Goes Viral, which tripled online interest in the product within 24 hours of its release.[130][131][132] In 2012, Aniston co-founded hair care brand Living Proof and also became its spokeswoman.

1272,"For the past several years, actor Tom Hiddleston has been a fan favorite at the San Diego Comic-Con. But this year, fans of the actor were left disappointed when he chose to ignore them and the media while he and the cast of the upcoming superhero film, “Thor: Ragnarok” were at Comic-Con to promote their film, which will hit theaters later this year. Tom Hiddleston’s portrayal of villan, Loki in the comic book superhero movie, “Thor” has garnered him legions of fans, mostly female who love his bad boy portrayal of the character.  Although Tom Hiddleston did participate in a panel with the other actors to answer questions about their upcoming film, he chose to skip the the opportunity to take photos with fans or sign autographs. This has left his fans feeling disappointed because some fans actually traveled thousands of miles for the chance to see Tom and get a picture with him.  This is a huge departure from years past, when Tom Hiddleston made it a point to see as many fans as possible. In 2013, while promoting “Thor: The Dark World”, Tom surprised and delighted fans by coming to the convention dressed in his full Loki costume. But this year he all but ignored his fans and only briefly appeared on the panel with the other actors and director of the movie, and left the convention as soon as the panel was over.  Audience members also remarked that the usually charming actor didn’t appear too excited to be at Comic-Con, with some of Tom’s own fans commenting that the actor appeared to look sad or unhappy. And it wasn’t just his fans that Tom ignored, he also chose to not speak to the media while at the convention. Besides a few questions from fans and the media during the panel discussion, Tom refused to be interviewed by journalists.  Many believe Tom is still embarrassed by his whirlwind romance with pop star Taylor Swift. Tom and Taylor Swift dated last summer and were heavily criticized for their public displays of affection, including Tom’s decision to wear a tank top declaring his love for the pop star.  Of course, Tom and Taylor Swift’s romance only lasted a few months, but it has been reported that his brief romance with the singer has hurt his Hollywood career, and may have even cost him the opportunity to take over the role of James Bond. For the past few months, Tom has kept a low profile with fans and the media, no doubt in hopes of avoiding questions about his past relationship with Taylor Swift.  Photo by Alberto E.

2080,"Uh-oh. Paris Jackson got cozy with Aussie model Tyler Green during the Melbourne Cup horse race in November, and her famous family isn’t exactly moonwalking with delight. They fear the pairing could spell trouble for the 19-year-old model, who’s struggled with sobriety in the past.  “Paris’ family worries she’ll start partying again because of Tyler,” an insider exclusively tells Life & Style. Tyler, 25, has bragged about his wild ways on Instagram, posting about months of “far too much drinking” and praising “bottomless red wine and pure debauchery.”  (Photo Credit: Splash)  Despite those red flags, Paris — who’s admitted to attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and who says she was suicidal after the death of dad Michael Jackson — is smitten. “Paris is trying to walk the straight and narrow, but she’s also looking for fun,” notes the insider. “She makes her own decisions, but her family wants her to make the right ones.”  Paris’ family’s concerns about her latest romance come months after she finally called it quits with on-and-off boyfriend Michael Snoddy. Back in February, a source told Us Weekly that the duo broke up after less than a year of dating. Though the insider said that Paris could end up reconciling with Michael in the future, they also said that the aspiring actress was more focused on her career than her love life.  “It appears that Paris and Michael have parted ways for now, but their future is uncertain,” the source said, adding that Paris was very excited about her guest role on Fox’s TV drama Star. “She is doing well, enjoying being on set with Lee Daniels and focusing her energy on the opportunities ahead.”  While she has yet to make her relationship with Tyler Instagram official, Paris did post a telling quote about love on Oct. 23: “People say love ism blind because they do not know what love is.

Much like her hilarious phrase-guessing game “Speak Out,” Moore was forced to try and explain to the 60-year-old television host why she was crying — while her mouth was filled with a large plastic device which made enunciation incredibly difficult.  But as is so often the case with these types of games, Moore struggled to make DeGeneres understand the words that were coming out of her mouth — and she nearly lost her composure trying to tell her that a donkey had “bucked” her mom.  “The donkey did what to your mom?” the television host asked, after hearing what she thought was a very different word.  During the episode, DeGeneres also took the opportunity to gift the actress a very special This is Us-themed gift: a Crock-Pot.  “So you have a blender, you have a toaster, you have a mixer. There’s something missing and I want to give you a housewarming gift so it’s gonna go on that shelf,” DeGeneres said before whipping out a shiny new Crock-Pot with a big red bow.  “I will remember to unplug this after I’m done using it,” Moore added with a laugh, referencing the kitchen appliance that played a part in the demise of her TV husband played by Milo Ventimiglia.

'She jetsets around the world collecting men and she can get any of them but she's so clingy that they leave and she cries and she gets another one in her web and she traps them and locks them in her mansion and she's crying in her marble bathtub surrounded by pearls.'

The Teen Mom 2 star addressed rumors of trouble with David Eason on her Instagram Story early Tuesday morning.

Image zoom Jenelle Evans/Instagram  Image zoom Jenelle Evans/Instagram  Hours after dispelling the breakup rumors, Evans posted a video of two of her children and Eason, whom she wed in September 2017, at a Christmas tree lot.  “In the pines, trying to find a #ChristmasTree,” she captioned an Instagram photo of herself and Eason embracing while looking for trees.  Evans’ posts come nearly two months after she placed a 911 call about Eason, alleging that he assaulted her.  PEOPLE confirmed that Evans was hospitalized. The chief of 911 operations for Columbus County, North Carolina, said that two police officers responded to a 911 call placed from the home of Evans and Eason on Oct. 13.  The call was placed by a female just before 10 p.m. and was “called in as an assault,” the chief said. An ambulance was also requested but later canceled, the chief said: “The female was transported to the hospital via private vehicle instead.”  A spokesperson for the Columbus County Sheriff’s Office told PEOPLE that no incident report was taken.  TMZ later posted audio of Evans’ 911 call, when she claimed that Eason injured her collarbone.  “My husband, he just assaulted me,” Evans told police, sounding distraught. “He pinned me down on the ground, I’m sorry, in the yard. And I think I heard my f—— collarbone crack. I can’t move my arm.”  RELATED VIDEO: Jenelle Evans Says She Has PTSD from Road Rage Incident: ‘He Almost Knocked My Son Out’  A rep for Evans previously told PEOPLE that the MTV star “had friends over Saturday night and they had a bonfire on her property” and “Jenelle ended up tripping and falling by the fire.”  In a statement to E!

4269,"Celebrity  A source reveals that the 'Hands to Myself' singer has threatened to end her relationship with her new beau 'unless [he] cuts off all contact' with his model ex-girlfriend.  Feb 23, 2017  AceShowbiz - It looks like Selena Gomez could not tolerate it if The Weeknd still keeps in touch with his ex Bella Hadid. According to a Life & Style report, the ""Hands to Myself"" singer has even threatened to dump her new beau upon catching him texting the Victoria's Secret model.  The tabloid claims that the former Disney darling and the ""Starboy"" singer, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, have got into a huge fight because he still texts his model ex-girlfriend. A source reveals that ""Selena was so angry, she threatened to end the relationship unless Abel cuts off all contact with Bella.""  ""Abel and Bella only speak occasionally,"" explains the alleged source, before adding, ""But he's a very independent guy, and he won't be told what to do by Selena."" The source further claims, ""He finds her neediness a major turnoff.""  The insider goes on alleging that it's no wonder if the ""Kill Em with Kindness"" hitmaker would feel intimidated by the 20-year-old model. Citing the insider, the tabloid says, ""People close to Bella wouldn't be surprised if she got back together with Abel one day.""  Reps for both Selena and The Weeknd have yet to respond to the report. While it's unclear if the new couple did get involved in the said quarrel, they were recently rumored to be in the ""honeymoon phase."" Fans wondered if he would pop the question soon, but a source revealed that it's ""not going to happen anytime soon.""",fake

4223,"According to TMZ, Chris Brown is the father of a 9-month-old girl born of his secret union with a model named Nia! The child would have been conceived in September 2013. At that time, the love life of the rapper was difficult to follow, once Rihanna, once Karrueche … But finally the singer of “Loyal” has his heart set on the 26 years old model…  If ever since the couple leads a complicated relationship between the “Love you, love you nots” and Chris troubles with the justice, Karrueche has always supported her bad boy, saying she was ready to marry him even though he went to prison. But faced with this surprising news, the young woman decided to officially stop this tormented relationship through her Twitter account:  “Listen. One can only take so much. The best of luck to Chris and his family. No baby drama for me.”  Apparently unaware of the existence of this child, Karrueche was also taken for a fool. In fact, the child’s mother is not a stranger to her.  TMZ found a picture where we can see Karrueche posing with her arm around Nia‘s neck at a party in Las Vegas. One of her best friends, Christina Milian, was also here and so was Breezy who has not been a very good boy that day. The pictures were taken in May 2013 a few months before Nia was pregnant.  If the singer has still not commented on the topic, a source close to him declares that “he is happy to be a dad” and that “he wants to be present in the life of his daughter!”  Rihanna shocked by the news is convinced that he will fulfill his father’s job. If she has read the article several times before digesting the news, she thinks “ Chris will be a good father and take care of his little girl. That’s a big responsibility and something that requires a lot of work, energy and love. She wishes him all the best in this new and very important chapter in his life”, said a source to Hollywood Life.  Do you think Chris Brown will be a good father?",fake
1268,"At this point, it's not a question of if Kim Kardashian (or any of her famous family members, for that matter) will be criticized for each of her parenting decisions, but rather, when the comments from Internet trolls will start rolling in. The latest instance of mommy-shaming plaguing Kardashian was sparked by a throwback photo of her husband and daughter that she posted on Instagram on Tuesday. In the pic, North West cuddles up to Kanye West and gives her smiling dad a kiss on the cheek. ""I can still feel the love 💕,"" Kim K captioned the adorable snapshot, quoting Kanye's recently released song ""Feel the Love.""  Almost immediately, critics began pouncing on Kardashian over the fact that, in the picture, North is wearing her naturally curly hair straight. ""I can feel the heat damage from here! Leave your [kid's] hair alone let her have the choice to damage it when she's older,"" one person commented. ""Stop straightening her hair,"" someone else wrote, while another added, ""That poor baby's curl pattern is gonna be all jacked up from the heat damage she's putting on her hair at a young age.""  Others, however, defended Kardashian, citing both her right to parent her children however she wants and the well-documented fact that North is already a burgeoning style star at just five years old. ""Y'all are so annoying. Maybe NORTH wanted her hair that way!!!!!! She's very opinionated as we can all see. AND it's VERY easy to straighten hair without heat damage seeing as [how] her mom has a TEAM of PROFESSIONAL hairstylists,"" one of her defenders wrote.  Last month, after catching similar flack for letting North wear her hair straight on her birthday, Kardashian West explained the decision to The Hollywood Reporter. ""She wanted straight hair and I straightened her hair one time. It's funny, because online everyone thought that we pressed it and did this whole thing. It was just a flat iron. I even read that she had extensions on! She has curly hair, so when you straighten her hair, it's gonna look really long. I can't believe people didn't get that. Sometimes you just have to tune it out! It was her birthday and all she wanted was to try to have her hair straightened,"" she said.  The KKW Beauty founder noted that her own professional hairstylist, Chris Appleton, helped out with North's special style, and added, ""She liked it, so we did it when we went to New York too, and that's it. You know, I'm not gonna let her straighten her hair all the time, but if she wants it that way two or three days a year, then that's fine with me. She loved it, but she loves her curly hair, too.""

1907,"“Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” is currently Broadway’s hottest ticket. One person who won’t be lucky enough to score a ticket? President Donald Trump.  “No,” Noma Dumezweni, who plays Hermione, said when asked if Trump should see the show. “Anybody else, yes.”  Even though the play itself is not overtly political, Harry Potter fans have drawn comparisons between Trump and the Dark Lord, Lord Voldemort, since the 2016 presidential election.  “I really do believe that’s why it’s resonating at the moment,” Dumezweni said on the red carpet at the Tony Awards. “We, all as human beings, are fighting to be connected. If you’re not seen and not heard, that’s where dangerous stuff happens. That’s where people under the radar do very cruel things.”  The two-part stage play, based on J.K. Rowling’s boy wizard Harry Potter, is set 19 years after the events of the seventh book installment, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.”  That’s what this play is about,” Dumezweni said. “It’s about bringing things into the light. Letting your light shine. This is what J.K. has always been about. Let the darkness out into the light. That’s why i’m very proud to be here telling this story right now. Those things are very important.”  “Cursed Child” is up for 10 Tonys, including best play, best performance by an actor, and best performance by an actress.  RELATED VIDEO:",fake

Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.  And while Brad would “never dream of” ruining his ex’s new marriage, he “would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.”  If they can’t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.  Brad Pitt “much happier” following split from Angelina Jolie  “They worked well together” when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad told In Touch. “He wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.”  That kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider states she wants in on “prestige projects” under his production banner. “She’d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress — something that’s evaded both her and Angelina.”  “He still considers Jen the love of his life,” the source concluded.

1260,"ABC will tie Michael Strahan even more closely to its “Good Morning America” franchise when it pairs the popular host with Sara Haines in a third hour of the program slated to air in early afternoon on the network starting September 10.  A person familiar with the program confirmed details about its hosts and disclosed the show’s start date. ABC News, which produces the program, declined to make executives available for comment.  Launch of the show will extend the presence of “GMA” to the network’s daytme schedule from its early-morning grid, and allow ABC to create bigger packages for advertisers, as NBC does with four hours of “Today.” The idea should also boost affiliates, as ABC can promote the extension during the main “GMA” broadcast that airs between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.  The new hour is expected to be taped, not presented live, and run at 1 p.m. on weekdays. One scenario that has been discussed for the new hour would involve making use of the live, in-studio audience assembled each morning for the 8 a.m. hour of the flagship show. ABC said earlier this year it would replace “The Chew” with the new “GMA” hour.  “Good Morning America” enjoyed an afternoon presence in the not-too-distant past. Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer co-anchored a short run of “Good Afternoon America” between July and September of 2012 in a separate bid to test expansion of the franchise.  “GMA” makes its leap as its battle for viewers with main rival“Today” remains intense. “Good Morning America” remains TV’s most-watched morning program, but “Today, co-anchored by Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, typically wins more viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most favored by advertisers. Season to date as of July 13, “Today” has lured 151,000 more viewers between 25 and 54 than its primary competitor, while “GMA” has notched 63,000 more viewers than “Today” overall.  The expansion to afternoons comes as ABC is also working to expand the digital presence for the show. In April, “GMA” launched a morning newsletter and unveiled a revamped “GMA” website that was not tied to ABC News’ content deal with Yahoo. At the time, Michael Corn, “GMA’ senior executive producer, noted that producers often gathered together more information and material than the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. program could handle. “We have so much content and a two-hour program isn’t even enough for the amount of stories we have to tell, and the amount of information we have,” he toldVariety.  Haines will leave “The View” to participate in the new program, marking the second departure of an ABC News correspondent from the program in recent days. ABC News announced earlier this week that Faris would leave her position at the show to do focus on reporting bigger stories. That narrows “The View” table down to four hosts: Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Meghan McCain. Details about the hosts for the third “GMA” hour were reported previously by Page Six.",fake

Not to mention, the new report claims they could have a baby girl on the way, and it’s a ‘dream come true’ for Gwen! Get all of the insane alleged details on their upcoming plans!  Blake Shelton, 40, and Gwen Stefani, 47, apparently have two huge reasons to celebrate! Gwen has allegedly been planning their epic Christmas nuptials in Blake’s home state of Oklahoma, according to Life & Style. On top of that, the magazine claims they’ve been “trying” to conceive, and alleged friends “believe she could already be pregnant.” WHAT!  Gwen has been longing for a baby girl because she’s felt “outnumbered” for years, according to Life & Style. She has three sons — Kingston, 10, Zuma, 8, and Apollo Rossdale, 2 — with her ex husband, Gavin Rossdale, 48. Insiders close to Gwen reportedly pointed out that she is consuming “a lot of carbs” right now; Something she reportedly never does unless she is expecting. Could this seriously be true?!  As if that wasn’t enough, the mag even reports that “she wouldn’t want to be an unwed mother at the time of the baby’s birth, so she’ll definitely be marrying Blake before then.” Well, this is apparently moving very fast. Adding to the alleged baby chatter, they even claim Gwen has “always wanted a big family,” and she believes “Blake will be a great dad and so protective of a little girl.” While we’re sure the country singer would make a terrific father, we’re not too sure if the pair could be expecting at the moment.  The happy couple have not even announced any type of engagement yet, let alone baby news. Not to mention, Gwen just celebrated her 47th birthday Oct. 3, and it looked like she could have been sipping some champagne from a video on her Snapchat. There were reports Blake was set to pop the question on her birthday, but that obviously didn’t happen, that we know of. Like we EXCLUSIVELY told you Gwen and Blake “are still going strong,” and although “he wants to marry Gwen, he hasn’t told anyone his ideas or timing for popping the question. He is keeping that very close to his chest.”  Just about everyone is hoping for Blake to get down on one knee, and speculation was at an all time high when the No Doubt front-woman appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show Sept. 23. She could hardly contain her excitement when Ellen, 58, asked about her supposed wedding plans. She said, “Before I make plans, because I make plans way ahead of time, tell me when you’re getting married … I just need to know so I can clear my schedule.” Gwen laughed and shied away from the question. The talkshow host told the singer to “let her know,” to where she replied, “Ok, I’ll let you know.” Obviously the two were just joking, but Gwen didn’t exactly deny anything! So, we’ll just have to wait and see what happens between Gwen and Blake, who have been dating for almost a year now. Here’s to hoping we’ll be hearing about an epic proposal very soon!

LOS ANGELES — Ellen DeGeneres couldn’t help but shed tears on the set of “The Ellen Show” Thursday when wife Portia de Rossi gave her a very special birthday present for her 60th birthday.  “It’s your 60th birthday and this gift had to be really special and it had to represent who you are and what you really care about,” Portia told her. “Not just now, but what you’ve always cared about.  De Rossi played a video showing scenes from the life of Dian Fossey, one of Ellen’s personal idols since she was a child. Fossey is well known for her work defending and documenting the mountain gorillas of Rwanda’s Virunga Mountains.  DeGeneres, who has worked for years to help rescue animals around the world, has said for the last two years that she wishes she could be doing more, de Rossi said. That was the inspiration for the gift that brought tears to her wife’s eyes.  “So for your birthday, Ellen, I am bringing you and your hero, Dian, together by building The Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund,” Portia said. “Ellen, you will carry on Dian’s legacy by giving them a permanent home in Rwanda. Now, you will join Dian as a protector and champion of these amazing animals, the mountain gorillas.  Not only that, Portia has also created The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund to help protect vulnerable species around the world.  “When we got married Portia’s line was it’s good to be loved, it’s profound to be understood, and she understands me because that is the best gift anybody could have given me,” Ellen said.

10524,"""The Starfighter Stunt"" is the twelfth episode of the first season of the animated micro-series Star Wars: Forces of Destiny. The episode takes place during Star Wars: The Clone Wars. It was first released as part of the first special on October 1, 2017 and it was released on Youtube on October 4.[2]  Contents show]  Official description Edit  While Ahsoka teaches Padmé how to pilot, they come under attack by a droid starfighter.  Plot summary Edit  In space, Padawan Ahsoka Tano is teaching Senator Padmé Amidala starfighter combat maneuvers. Both women are flying a pair of N-1 starfighters. Tano's ship is yellow while Amidala's ship is silver. R2-D2 is also riding in the astromech socket of Padmé's starfighter. Tano tells Amidala she is getting better but that she needs to keep up with her. The two fly their starfighters past an asteroid. However, a modified Vulture droid is hiding and lying in wait under the asteroid and pursues them. R2-D2 spots the droid and warns Amidala and Tano. The two lead the droid starfighter on a pursuit over a nearby comet.  When Amidala asks how they can defeat the droid fighter, Tano says that droids can't improvise and that they must do something unexpected. The Vulture droid fires a green sonic wave at Amidala's starfighter. Tano shields Amidala's fighter by flying into the path of the sonic wave. She is struck unconscious but survives. While Tano's ship drifts in space, the droid fighter continues the pursuit and manages to damage one of the engines of Amidala's fighter. Amidala tells R2-D2 to put out the engine fire.  Taking Tano's cue to improvise, Amidala flies the N-1 fighter inside the comet. She then resurfaces and sneaks up on the droid fighter from behind and shoots it down. The droid fighter crashes into the comet and explodes. Amidala then contacts Tano over the intercom. Tano is alive but has a headache from the sonic boom. Amidala tells her not to worry because she blew up the droid. While Amidala is surprised at her starfighter skills, Tano reassures her friend that she has always had a good instinct. Amidala thanks her and the two head home.  Credits Edit  Appearances Edit      Bibliography Edit      Notes and references Edit    ",real
1873,"Gossip Cop today debunked a tabloid cover story claiming that Megyn Kelly is replacing Matt Lauer on NBC’s Today show.  In Touch’s latest cover features a headline screaming “Shakeup At The ‘Today Show’: Matt Replaced By Megyn,” along with a dubious story alleging betrayal and backstabbing between the two television heavy-hitters.  Yet the piece “appears to be wholly manufactured by the publication,” according to Mediaite‘s sister site Gossip Cop.  What’s more, the tabloid offers up some fairly outrageous evidence to support its story, claiming Kelly showed up Lauer by nabbing a joint interview with President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. It’s fairly safe to assume Trump will not be joining Putin on a love seat for for a tell-all with Megyn Kelly anytime soon, as much as we would like to will that into existence.  Lauer, Gossip Cop reports, will continue to be the face of Today and a key fixture at NBC News despite the arrival of Kelly, which is currently slated for June.  From the report:  The notion that Lauer has been “replaced,” says an extremely well-placed NBC News insider, is “totally false.” And as for the contention that there will be a joint Putin and Trump interview, and that it will be conducted by Kelly, our impeccable source calls it “laughable.”  In Touch has published a number of demonstrably false stories touting a feud between Lauer and Kelly, including another cover story from February alleging Lauer was going to be “dumped” at the Today show in favor of the former Fox News star.  Last September, when she was still at Fox, Kelly––who said she’s friends with Lauer and respects him a lot––defended him after he got criticism in the liberal media for not being tough enough on Donald Trump during that NBC News presidential forum.

On Saturday, Woods retweeted a tweet that criticized the age gap between the two characters, to which Hammer responded: “Didn’t you date a 19-year-old when you were 60…….?”  Woods was 59 when he reportedly started dating 19-year-old girlfriend Ashley Madison. They split after more than six years of dating; in 2013, the 66-year-old Woods began dating 20-year-old Kristen Bauguess.  Call Me By Your Name debuted earlier this year to glowing reviews at the Sundance Film Festival and will hit theaters Nov. 24.  “I can’t think of another movie where two men are so openly and honestly with each other,” Hammer told EW earlier this summer. “We made a movie that’s so tender and enjoyable, it can bridge gaps.”",fake

Email Print Img No-img Menu Whatsapp Google Reddit Digg Stumbleupon Linkedin Comment  After his major surgical mishap at the end of season 1, Dr. Shaun Murphy (Freddie Highmore) is expected to go through a lot of changes when ""The Good Doctor"" returns for season 2.  Get The Christian Post newsletter in your inbox. The top 7 stories of the day, curated just for you!  Delivery: Weekdays  In the first season finale, Shaun accidentally hit a patient's aortic wall in the middle of a surgery because he was thinking about the toy scalpel that his late brother Steve gave him, which he thought he lost. The incident almost caused the patient's life.  But even if the patient survived, Shaun opted to admit his mistake to San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital's chief of surgery Dr. Marcus Andrews (Hill Harper). This will put his and his mentor Dr. Aaron Glassman's (Richard Schiff) licenses in danger.  In an interview with TVLine, showrunner David Shore talked about the Shaun and Glassman's fate in ""The Good Doctor"" season 2.  According to Shore, they have always planned for the ending since the pilot of the show. ""It's important to me that Shaun not just be a superhero with autism, but be a real person with strengths and weaknesses,"" Shore stated.  The showrunner also mentioned that he wanted Shaun to showcase his excellent skills as a doctor with autism, but also show that he is capable of making both major and minor mistakes.  The finale also reiterated Glassman's promise in the premiere episode that he will give up his job as the president of the hospital if Shaun will not live up to the expectations. ""You know, if you show a gun in Act 1, it has to be fired in Act 4. That [promise], to me, was the equivalent of a gun, and I wanted to see Shaun make a mistake,"" he also said.  Shore also mentioned that fans could expect to see Shaun working back at the hospital when the series returns for its sophomore season. ""I think the focus [of Season 2] is going to be that there's a new hierarchy — a new sheriff in town,"" he also stated.  On the other hand, executive producer Daniel Day Kim also teased that there are a lot of things to look forward to in the second season during his interview with E! News before the show's panel at the PaleyFest.  ""David [Shore] has some really wonderful things in store,"" Kim stated. ""Some really nice character turns. Freddie [Highmore]'s journey—Shaun's journey—is going to have a couple of twists and turns that I find incredibly compelling,"" he added.  Shore also said in the same interview that he wants to continue exploring the same things and issues where Shaun will be thrown in different situations where he will be challenged. ""Because I think the show superficially is about Dr. Murphy learning how to navigate the world, but I think on a deeper level, the show is much more of what Dr. Murphy has to teach us,"" he also stated.  Fans should also expect to see the series talk about Glassman's cancer in the second season of the medical drama.  ""The Good Doctor"" is expected to return to ABC later this year.",real
7232,"A few things are constant on Bravo’s hugely popular Real Housewives reality shows: bitter fights, excessive alcohol consumption, and luxurious wealth. The latter is at least as much a strategic appearance as it is a financial fact for many of the stars. Some have been dealt serious blows to their investment portfolios, as when the housing crisis memorably hit the women of The Real Housewives of Orange County, the franchise’s original program. But others, from Beverly Hills’ unapologetically extravagant Lisa Vanderpump to Atlanta’s legendary musician member Kandi Burruss, have the assets and bank statements to back up their swagger.  Daily Money Sign up to receive the latest updates and the smartest advice. Sign Up Now  MONEY compiled reporting on the estimated net worths of all the current regular stars of the Real Housewives shows. We should note: any “net worth site” should be taken with a grain of salt, but using them we can get a picture of who are the richest housewives on each installment, ranked from the the richest to the merely rich.  The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills: Lisa Vanderpump  (L-R) Eden Sassoon, Lisa Vanderpump. Nicole Weingart/Bravo.  Estimated net worth: $75 million  The stars of RHOBH are not shy about flaunting their wealth. They do so in ways that make other casts in the franchise look downright humble. That’s especially true of Lisa Vanderpump, who reportedly has the highest net worth of all the current U.S. Housewives stars and has seemed indomitable over all eight seasons of the Beverly Hills show.  Though castmates like Kyle Richards and Erika Jayne are doing more than well for themselves, Vanderpump rules over an opulent mansion with everything one could imagine (there was that time she even bought two miniature horses for her backyard and made it seem almost kind of normal). Together with her husband Ken Todd, she runs an enviable restaurant empire, including the Los Angeles hotspots SUR, Pump, and Villa Blanca, all of which get plenty of publicity on RHOBH. In addition to a reported salary of $500,000 per season of that show, her business is the center of the Bravo spinoff Vanderpump Rules, following her absurdly dramatic serving staff, for which she serves as an executive producer. The perpetually calm Vanderpump, meanwhile, is taking it all the way to the bank.  The Real Housewives of New York City: Carole Radziwill  ""The Politics of Friendship"" Episode 905 with Carole Radziwill Heidi Gutman/Bravo.  Estimated net worth: $50 million  Journalist may not seem like the most likely career for a Real Housewife, but RHONY’s Radziwill has received numerous accolades over a long career in broadcast news. She worked as a producer at ABC News and even won a Peabody for her work, which included being stationed in Iraq during the Gulf War. She also married a man of nobility, Prince Anthony Radziwill, which certainly accounts for her stunning net worth. Sadly, he died in 1999, an event she has written about in bestselling books including the memoir What Remains.  The Real Housewives of Atlanta: Kandi Burruss  -R) Todd Tucker and Kandi Burruss Wilford Harewood/Bravo. (L  Estimated net worth: $35 million  Even if you don’t recognize Burruss, you know her work. The singer-songwriter is a member of the popular R&B group Xscape, and was one of the songwriters credited on TLC’s massive hit “No Scrubs.” The Grammy winner has had no problem finding success in her music career, but she’s also pulling in a reported $450,000 per season of RHOA, which she joined in the second season. The label triple threat doesn’t even do her justice.  The Real Housewives of Orange County: Shannon Beador  ""Mystic Mistake"" Episode 1215 — with Shannon Beador Nicole Weingart/Bravo.  Estimated net worth: $20 million  Beador may be the butt of some jokes on RHOC thanks to her New Agey personality and intense dedication to alternative medicine, but she has plenty of money to burn on her odd hobbies. Having joined the show during the ninth season, she’s had public ups and downs with her husband, David Beador, the owner of a successful construction company. They announced a separation at the end of 2017, but it’s unclear if they’ve finalized a divorced. Even if they do, it’s clear she’ll still make out okay, as Beador’s company reportedly pulls in more than $20 million in annual revenue.  The Real Housewives of Dallas: Stephanie Hollman  THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF DALLAS with Stephanie Hollman Peter Larsen/Bravo  Estimated net worth: $18 million  The other rookie in the Real Housewives lineup is RHOD, but its stars reported net worths can hold their own against the other entries. Born in a small town in Oklahoma, Hollman now reigns queen in Dallas, at least on this show. Her husband Travis owns and operates the Hollman locker company, which has been in his family since 1976 and counts among its clients the Chicago Cubs, the Los Angeles Lakers, the Dallas Mavericks, American Express, Facebook, and SoulCycle.  The Real Housewives of New Jersey: Teresa Giudice  . Bravo—NBCU  Estimated net worth: $11 million  Giudice has been present through all eight seasons of RHONJ, despite having a bumpy road. She spent nearly a year in prison for a fraud conviction and was released in 2015. But she had already proved her perseverance. During her run on the show, she’s become a New York Times bestselling author with cookbooks inspired by her Italian heritage, including Skinny Italian and Fabulicious!. Between her publishing career and being a media personality, along with other sources of income, she’s beat out her castmates to reach eight figures.  The Real Housewives of Potomac: Karen Huger  THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF POTOMAC with Karen Huger Larry French/Bravo—NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images  Estimated net worth: $10 million  One of the new entries in the ever-expanding Real Housewives universe, RHOP’s stars may not be as famous as their counterparts, but one at least has pulled in serious cash. Huger’s husband Raymond is a software executive, whom she’s referred to as “the black Bill Gates.” But it’s not all necessarily rosy for the couple, as Raymond and his company reportedly owe millions in back taxes.",real

486,"A shocking new report claims Kourtney Kardashian’s pregnant again — and they have a theory as to who the father may be! Is it her ex, Younes Bendjima?    Here’s another plot twist in Kourtney Kardashian’s love life. The KUWTK star is allegedly pregnant after publicly being seen with “what appeared to be a bump” in L.A. on July 30, a new report by OK! magazine claims! “It was strange to see because she’s usually so perfectly svelte,” a source told the outlet, and a friend to Kourt added, “Everyone is whispering that she’s pregnant with her fourth child.” If Kourtney is supposedly pregnant, then who on Earth is the father to baby number four? And by that, we mean, is it once again baby daddy Scott Disick, 35, or ex-boyfriend Younes Bendjima, 25? Naturally, one would assume it’s the younger model, who to the world was Kourtney’s boyfriend up until recently. But Kourtney’s anonymous friend makes a shocking claim — it’s more than likely Scott!  “They’ve been meeting up on the down-low for a while now,” the friend said, going so far as to add that Kourtney and Scott hooked up in Mexico. Keep in mind, Scott has been dating model Sofia Richie, 19, since 2017 – but reportedly, that was not on Scott’s mind when he allegedly hooked up with Kourtney in a “recent” trip to Mexico, the magazine claims! “They made it look like a family trip because their kids [Mason, 8, Penelope, 6, and Reign, 3] were there, but they hooked up,” the source said before adding, “Everyone is buzzing that she’s carrying Scott’s baby.” As far as we know, Kourtney and Scott, who broke up in 2015, haven’t publicly taken a family vacay with the kids in Mexico since 2016. But they did go to Punta Mita, Mexico just days apart with their respective lovers in January. Scott then returned to Mexico for a Cabo San Lucas getaway with the kids, but it was Sofia who played mommy. Is the magazine insinuating that Kourtney was a secret stow-away? The friend went on to say that Kourtney wouldn’t fret over Scott being her baby daddy again because “all of their kids came out beautifully.”  And apparently, Kourtney and Younes weren’t together for as long as most assumed. News just broke on Aug. 8 that Kourtney actually ended her relationship with the 25-year-old model on the second week of July because he cheated on her. Still, if Kourtney’s alleged baby bump wasn’t just a mistaken case of bloating, then Younes could very well be the father. It takes between 12 to 16 weeks for a bump to show. Sixteen weeks ago, Kourt and Younes were still very much on! Despite all the speculations, everyone’s stumped. Even Kourtney supposedly “isn’t sure how to handle this situation.” The friend added that Kourtney “isn’t saying if the daddy is Scott, Younes or another mystery man she’s been spending time with…it may end up taking some of Kris [Jenner’s] management skills to straighten out this mess!”  Maybe this report isn’t so wild, after a source close to Sofia EXCLUSIVELY shared with HollywoodLife.com on Aug. 7 that Sofia gave her boyfriend an ultimatum – it’s her or Kourtney! Is Sofia feeling threatened, which would only make the hookup rumors between Scott and Kourtney appear to be more than gossip? “[Sofia] wants to live a life with Scott, have a future with Scott and have kids with Scott,” our source told us. “So if he is thinking of getting back with Kourtney she wants none of it.”  HollywoodLife.com has reached out to Younes Bendjima’s and Scott Disick’s reps for a comment.",fake

So it’s no shock that Queen Elizabeth has had her fair share of tiffs with other members of the royal family during her tenure wearing the crown. Still, a feud with daughter-in-law Kate Middleton? That one seems a little difficult to believe. Nevertheless, as most in-law situations go, the two haven’t always been on perfect terms. Here is the crazy reason the queen and the Duchess of Cambridge haven’t always gotten along.  But for starters, keep this in mind …  Is there really drama behind the smiles? | Chris Jackson/Getty Images Is there really drama behind the smiles? | Chris Jackson/Getty Images  The tabloids go into a frenzy over any rumor that the royals are fighting with each other. Heck, they’re already trying to claim that Meghan Markle and Camilla Parker-Bowles are at odds — and Meghan hasn’t even married into the family yet! So, like with all reports of bickering, a feud between Her Majesty and Duchess Catherine could be a lot of hot air.  Next: All that being said …  The Duchess has had her fair share of feuds  Kate and Beatrice don’t get along. | Chris Jackson/Getty Images Kate and Beatrice don’t get along. | Chris Jackson/Getty Images  It has been documented, however, that Duchess Catherine hasn’t always gotten along with her in-laws in the past. Plenty of reports have surfaced claiming that Kate and Camilla were at odds because Camilla tried to keep her from marrying Prince William. And it has never been a secret that Kate doesn’t get along with her cousin-in-law, Princess Beatrice.  Next: And what about HRH?  The queen’s most notorious feuds?  Princess Margaret and Queen Elizabeth haven’t always gotten along. | Fox Photos/Getty Images Princess Margaret and Queen Elizabeth haven’t always gotten along. | Fox Photos/Getty Images  Rumors of royal feuds with Queen Elizabeth go back for years. There was bickering with her sister, Princess Margaret when the queen refused her sister’s proposal to marry a divorced man. Then there was the years-long feud she had with Princess Diana. She even reportedly fought with Prince Charles when he needed support after Princess Diana’s death and was met with a cold shoulder.  Next: When did the alleged beef with Kate start?  The first of the rumors  Was the queen feuding with Kate before her wedding? | Dave Thompson/AFP/Getty Images Was the queen feuding with Kate before her wedding? | Dave Thompson/AFP/Getty Images  Again, much of this is hearsay. But rumors of a royal feud between Queen Elizabeth and her granddaughter-in-law started around the time of the royal wedding in 2011. There were claims that the queen didn’t like all the attention that Kate was getting, or how much money she spent on fancy clothes. Over the years, the two women have spent more time together because the duchess has taken on more royal duties — especially since Prince Phillip retired. It’s more likely that the two are just spending a lot of time together, and not necessarily arguing all the time.  Next: What the rags are saying now.  Latest feud news?  William and Kate are expecting their third child. | William and Kate are expecting their third child. | Kensington Palace via Instagram  The latest of the “feud news” came in October of 2017, shortly after it was revealed that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were expecting their third child. Kate had to take a step back from her public duties because of severe sickness from her pregnancy and reportedly wants to maintain a more private role after the child is born. This decision to step away from royal duties reportedly didn’t sit well with the queen.

As previously mentioned, Kate Middleton has taken on a lot of royal responsibilities since becoming a royal, and she accepted more duties over recent years. The decision to step back from her responsibilities could have potentially rubbed Her Majesty the wrong way.  Next: Something to consider if the feud is for real.  Would this affect the succession line?  Could this feud make Charles king? | Chris Jackson/Getty Images Could this feud make Charles king? | Chris Jackson/Getty Images  There is a lot of speculation as to whether Queen Elizabeth will abdicate the throne this year — and who will succeed in her place. Although rules stipulate that the crown would without a doubt be passed to Prince Charles, there is still speculation as to whether the family will make room for Prince William to be king. If this is the case, would that cause tension within the family if the king’s wife has taken on a lesser role? With most this feuding being rumored, it’s still difficult to say.

19038,"Getty  Kim Kardashian returned this week to Paris for the first time since her 2016 robbery at gunpoint.  The reality star talked openly about facing her trauma in a post to her app on Friday, one day after visiting the unofficial fashion capitol of the world.  Kim made the trip to Paris Thursday with Kanye West to support his best friend Virgil Abloh in his debut collection for Louis Vuitton at the label's spring/summer 2019 menswear show at Paris Fashion Week.  It has been nearly two years since Kim was last in the city. In October 2016, she was held at gunpoint and bound and gagged by five burglars. The thieves stole two cellphones and approximately $10 million worth of jewelry, including a $4 million dollar ring.  ""I went back to Paris to witness Kanye's BFF, Virgil Abloh, make history with his first collection and runway show for Louis Vuitton during Mens Fashion Week,"" she wrote on her website. ""It was such an emotional trip!""  ""For me, it was the perfect time to come back to a place where I fell in love, but also a place where I suffered great trauma,"" she continued. ""The trip was actually only 12 hours because right after the show, we had to fly home for Teyana Taylor's listening party the same night!""  ""Emotionally, I feel calm. I've truly put the experience behind me, and have learned and grown from it. Because of this, mentally coming back to Paris wasn't difficult for me. It feels refreshing to face my fears and overcome them. For me, there's no point in staying in a fucked-up state of mind. 'Feel it, go through it and move on' has always been how I try to live my life. I would never suggest to anyone how to grieve, I can simply say what has worked for me.""  ""I'm so happy I went back,"" Kim said. ""It was the perfect experience coming back to a city I love so much.""  At Abloh's runway show, Kim and Kanye were also joined by Kylie Jenner and Stormy's dad Travis Scott. Kanye and Abloh have been close friends for a long time, which was shown when the rapper broke down in proud tears, as he hugged Abloh after his show.  Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.  Abloh, who was appointed as artistic director of Louis Vuitton's menswear collections last March, is also the founder and CEO of Milan-based luxury brand Off-White. In other words, Abloh has many celebrity friends and fans, such as Bella Hadid, Rihanna, and Naomi Campbell, who were all also in attendance at the runway show.",real
15200,"Watch Now: CBS Sports HQ ( 24:00:00 )  Serena Williams is officially back. She revealed on Instagram on Wednesday that she will return to professional tennis on Thursday, at Indian Wells, which coincides with International Women's Day.  It would be a bit of an understatement to call Serena excited.  A lot has changed for the tennis superstar in the past year. She gave birth to her daughter and endured scary ordeal in the hospital after having an emergency C-section that left her bed-ridden for six weeks. Her return coincides with a new Nike ad campaign, unveiled during Sunday night's Oscars broadcast, with Williams spreading the message that ""there's no wrong way to be a woman.""  On Thursday, Williams will get back to what thrust her into the public eye by returning to the tennis court against Zarina Diyas at Indian Wells in California, one of the larger non-Grand Slam tournaments. Williams hasn't played in a singles match since Jan. 28, 2017, when she won the Australian Open while approximately two months pregnant. After that, Williams took her leave. She gave birth to her daughter, Alexis Ohanian Jr., on Sep. 1 before suffering a serious scare post-pregnancy, in which Williams said she could have died without the quality health-care she had. After six weeks of bed rest, Williams started practicing again in December. She was hoping to be back in time for the 2018 Australian Open, but she ended up withdrawing.  Williams has played professional matches, just not singles. Her official return was on Feb. 11 in a doubles match with Venus Williams in the Fed Cup. She was visibly rusty, and the sisters were swept 6-2, 6-3 against the Netherlands.  According to Venus, however, Serena is just fine.  ""She's got power, depth. She knows how to play,"" Venus said at the Tie Break Tens Tournament in Madison Square Garden, via ABC. ""Yeah, awesome game.""  Williams returns to the singles pro circuit with a clean slate. She isn't ranked officially, but she's one Grand Slam title behind Margaret Court. Court finished her career with 24 Grand Slams, whereas Williams has 23.  Williams could face Venus as early as the third round in Indian Wells, if the sisters both advance. Serena's first opponent will be Diyas, while a potential second-round match would be against Kiki Bertens.  There's a lot on the line at Indian Wells. It will be a good first look at Williams to see where she stands, and although it's probably unrealistic to expect her to win, gauging progress will be key. Williams' goals, however, are as lofty as ever.  ""Serena's target will be to win Grand Slams,"" said Williams' coach, Patrick Mouratoglou in an interview with WTATennis.com. ""She knows that coming back might take some time, but her level of expectation is high as always. There are three Grand Slams (French Open, Wimbledon, US Open) left this season. They will be her three main goals for 2018.""  Williams is a three-time French Open winner, a seven-time Wimbledon champion and a six-time US Open winner. Williams is already 36, while Court retired when she was 35. Longevity is hardly a question for her. Williams is the oldest woman to hold a WTA No. 1 ranking at 35 years, 224 days, holding the spot until May 8, 2017. To leave, miss a year, have a child, and return at age 36? That sounds like Williams' kind of challenge.",real
17024,"""Found out last night that laughing, crying, tequila & wine DO mix - let's just be a trio,"" Carly Pearce joked  Better hide the wine! Maren Morris, Kelsea Ballerini and Carly Pearce each topped the country charts this year — and celebrated with an epic girls’ night.  The three stars got together at Ballerini’s home on Monday evening and each posted an adorable picture from the gathering — which, according to their captions, involved a lot of vino and tequila.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Shared some laughs + some horror stories + a LOT of tequila and wine,” Morris, 28, wrote on Instagram before comparing the trio to their predecessors, Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt. “Merry christmas from dolly, emmylou and linda,” she added alongside the Christmas tree and wine emojis.  Pearce, 28, captioned her own photo: “Found out last night that laughing, crying, tequila & wine DO mix – let’s just be a trio … Merry Christmas y’all #stillhungover.” Ballerini, 25, also shared the photo with some queen and red heart emojis.  With the dearth of women played on country radio an ongoing issue, the women are supportive of each other’s success. When Ballerini recently posted an emotional video of her mom finding out she’d been nominated for a second Grammy, Morris and Pearce were quick to chime in.  “Ok, was not emotionally prepared for this,” Morris commented. “So happy for you, Kels. Let’s do it again.”  “Wow,” Pearce added next to the sobbing emoji.  Image zoom Kelsea Ballerini Instagram  And when Morris, who racked up five Grammy nominations last week, recently tweeted some quotes from critics — “plenty said ‘you’re too country.’ plenty said ‘you ain’t country enough.’ guess what? both were wrong,” she wrote — Ballerini was quick to amplify the sentiment.  Image zoom Kelsea Ballerini tweets support of Maren Morris Maren Morris/Twitter  “Amen,” she tweeted, to which Morris responded with, “Let’s do it our way.”  This isn’t exactly a new friendship, either. Over this past summer, country’s top trio got their sweat on together with the help of trainer Erin Oprea.  Image zoom Maren Morris, Carly Pearce and Kelsea Ballerini Kelsea Ballerini/Instagram  Image zoom Maren Morris, Carly Pearce and Kelsea Ballerini Kelsea Ballerini/Instagram  Ballerini and Pearce both Instagrammed photos from the day. In one shot, they’re posing selfie style, and Ballerini captioned it, “3 country singers walk into an @erinoprea workout…” In the other, they’re showing off their muscles and dumbbells — or, as Pearce described it, “Lots of country booty kickin’.”  “They told me you have to set boundaries of the time you spend apart,” the “Closer to You” singer, who has been dating fellow singer Michael Ray since earlier this year, previously told PEOPLE. To Pearce and Ray, that has meant adding even more travel to their schedules.  “We are always apart, but it’s oddly the number one priority for both of us to be together,” she says. “He’s very good about showing up at shows for me or I fly to him. I used to be such a homebody, and I missed my home on the road a lot. But now home is where he is.”  RELATED VIDEO: Carly Pearce on Her First Time Walking the Red Carpet with Anyone Else",real
2110,"Khloe Kardashian did not give birth over Easter weekend, despite inaccurate speculation. Gossip Cop can debunk this claim. We’re told the reality star hasn’t had her baby just yet.  An article posted on OK!’s website on Thursday theorizes that Kardashian has given birth because she hasn’t posted a selfie in nearly a week. The reality star actually did post a photo of herself Sunday on Easter, but the site baselessly speculates it’s an old picture.  The unreliable tabloid goes on to say it’s “suspicious” that Kardashian wasn’t at her family’s Easter party over the weekend. “It’s definitely strange for her to miss the big event,” adds the publication. Actually, it’s not. Kardashian is currently in Cleveland, where her boyfriend Tristan Thompson lives and where she plans to give birth. The Kardashian-Jenner clan threw their Easter bash in Los Angeles.  Additionally, Kardashian tweeted on Wednesday night that she was still “nesting” by relaxing and watching “The Real Housewives of New York City.” Meanwhile, Us Weekly reported that Kris Jenner plans to be by her daughter’s side when she gives birth, but the momager hasn’t arrived in Cleveland as of yet. E! also confirmed on Monday that Kardashian “is still resting and relaxing at home.”  And finally, Kardashian revealed on her website on Wednesday that she’s still in “the final stretch of pregnancy” and can’t wait for her baby to arrive, even noting she’s staring to get “impatient.” Regardless of the overwhelming amount of proof that the reality star didn’t give birth over Easter, Gossip Cop still checked in with a source close to the situation, who confirms she hasn’t delivered yet.  It should be noted, the birth of Kardashian’s baby is imminent. It’s likely the reality star will welcome her child any day now, but it simply didn’t happen last weekend. Unfortunately, we’re not surprised OK! got the story wrong. This isn’t the first time we’ve had to call out the magazine for publishing a bogus report surrounding the reality star’s pregnancy.  Last month, Gossip Cop busted the unreliable outlet for falsely claiming that Kardashian had been rushed to the hospital with pregnancy complications. That never happened, and this latest article speculating the reality star already gave birth is equally inaccurate.",fake
290,"Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin recently got engaged after a month of dating (Summer 2018 strikes again!), and now the internet is speculating about WHY they're rushing into marriage.  The obvious answer is that Justin and Hailey are in love and want to spend forever together, but there's also a rumor lurking in some corners of the internet (read: Twitter) claiming that Hailey's pregnant. Which, to be clear, is definitely not anyone's business, and is also pretty sexist!  That aside, a pap caught up with Justin while he was buying coffee, and made the mistake of asking him about the rumors, saying ""Is Hailey pregnant right now? You stated that you guys are family, so everybody was thinking she might be pregnant.""  This content is imported from YouTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  Justin's response?

I just don’t understand why you gotta try to get a rise, you know what I’m saying?"" He also said ""No, you know what you’re doing"" when the pap tried to defend himself, and eventually asked for the camera to be turned off.

1164,"The pair first made headlines when they hit the dance floor together at the Apollo in the Hamptons event in East Hampton, New York, in 2013  Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Split: A Look Back at Their Private Romance  Under-the-radar couple Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes have called it quits after six years of dating.  An entertainment source confirmed to PEOPLE “Jamie and Katie split.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The pair, who have been linked since 2013, parted ways in May — the same month that they posed together for the first time at the 2019 Met Gala. They were also seen laughing and holding hands in videos posted to designer Zac Posen’s Instagram Stories.  In April, a source told PEOPLE that Foxx, 51, and Holmes, 40, were trying to make time for each other as much as possible.  “When they can spend time together, they do. When they’re busy and they can’t, they don’t. They are two adults who enjoy each other’s company and have for a long time,” the insider said.  The former couple remained tight-lipped about their romance, but managed to make several other rare appearances together throughout their relationship.  In January 2018, Foxx and Holmes looked every bit the happy couple at Clive Davis‘ annual Pre-Grammy Awards Gala. Though the two arrived separately, they sat together at the same table once inside the star-studded event.  But it appeared the actress tried to avoid drawing attention to herself by leaving the room and moving to a different seat just moments before Davis announced the singer’s presence.  However, Davis called out the move, saying, “This lady left the room right when I was going to introduce her, she was sitting at that table right with Jamie Foxx and everyone else.”  Davis added, “If you’re going to sit together what better night than tonight?”  Image zoom Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx at the 2019 Met Gala Kevin Tachman/MG19/Getty  The pair even wrapped up the year with a December yacht outing in Miami, followed by a jet ski trip the next day.  And that wasn’t the first time Foxx and Holmes were caught on a romantic outing.  in May 2017, Foxx and Holmes were spotted spending time together in Paris.  Holmes met up at a hotel with Foxx, who had been in the City of Lights to shoot his film Robin Hood, sources confirmed at the time. (Meanwhile, Cruise was working on the sixth installment of his Mission: Impossible franchise a few blocks away.)    While the actress kept a low profile during her Paris stay, she did stop by Luc Besson’s studio Cité du Cinemas where Foxx was filming. Later, the duo were photographed boarding a private jet together out of the city.  In September 2017, the stars were spotted walking hand in hand along the sand barefoot in Malibu, relaunching years-long buzz about a romance. A few months later in December, the two celebrated Foxx’s 50th birthday with a night out in Los Angeles. They were seen leaving the Highlight Room together.  A new round of rumors surfaced in 2016 after the actress stepped out in New York City wearing a diamond ring (which she’d been sporting for months) while Foxx was spotted wearing a gold band.  Foxx’s rep told PEOPLE at the time that the movie stars were neither engaged nor married.  Image zoom Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx at the Clive Davis Pre-Grammy Gala in 2018 Kevin Mazur/Getty Images  In 2015, a source told PEOPLE they weren’t getting serious. “This is not some intense romance,” the source said. “Jamie and Katie are friends and have been for a long time. They are two adults who are attractive and single, and so apparently conclusions will be drawn. But contrary to those conclusions, they’re not about to run off and make some serious commitment.”  Added a Foxx source at the time: “[They] see each other and go out together, but Jamie would tell you he is not involved with anyone seriously. [He]’s a workaholic and couldn’t be happier in his life as it is.”  In a November 2014 cover story, Holmes told PEOPLE that she “absolutely” still believes in love.  “I’m a very loving person,” she said. “Of course I’m open to finding love again.”  The pair first made headlines when they hit the dance floor together at the Apollo in the Hamptons event in East Hampton, New York, in 2013, a little over a year after Holmes and Tom Cruise split in 2012 after six years of marriage. They jammed out to Robin Thicke’s summer anthem, “Blurred Lines” and Foxx’s 2009 hit “Blame It (On the Alcohol)” at the benefit concert.  RELATED ViDEO: Are Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Dating?  The actor and musician denied that he and Holmes were an item following the encounter.  “[The rumors] are one hundred percent not true. In fact, it’s quite hilarious because we simply danced at a charity event along with a lot of other people,” he told Entertainment Tonight at the time.  Reps for both actors had no immediate comment in response to news of their split.

Educated at Hurtwood House in Dorking, Blunt made her acting debut in a 2001 stage production of The Royal Family. She went on to appear in the television film Boudica (2003) and portrayed Queen Catherine Howard in the miniseries Henry VIII (2003). She made her feature film debut in the drama My Summer of Love (2004). Blunt's breakthrough came in 2006 with her starring roles in the television film Gideon's Daughter and the highly successful comedy-drama film The Devil Wears Prada. The former won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and the latter earned her a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.  Blunt's profile continued to grow with starring roles in the period film The Young Victoria (2009), the romantic comedy Salmon Fishing in the Yemen (2011), the science fiction films The Adjustment Bureau (2011), Looper (2012), and Edge of Tomorrow (2014), and the musical films Into the Woods (2014) and Mary Poppins Returns (2018). She garnered acclaim for her performances as a principled FBI agent in the crime film Sicario (2015), an alcoholic in the thriller The Girl on the Train (2016), for which she received a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, and a survivalist mother in the horror film A Quiet Place (2018). For the latter, which was directed by her husband John Krasinski, she won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Supporting Actress.  Early life [ edit ]  Blunt was born in Wandsworth, London.[4][5] She is the second of four children[6] born to Joanna, a former actress and teacher,[7][8] and barrister Oliver Simon Peter Blunt, QC.[9][10][11] Her siblings are Felicity, Sebastian, and Susannah.[9][12] Her grandfather was Major General Peter Blunt, and one of her paternal uncles is Crispin Blunt,[13] Conservative Member of Parliament for Reigate.  From the age of seven to 14, Blunt struggled with stuttering.[14] She credits a school teacher for helping her overcome the stutter through acting.[15] She went on to sit on the board of directors for the American Institute for Stuttering.[16] Blunt attended Ibstock Place School in Roehampton, southwest London and, at the age of 16, went to Hurtwood House near Dorking, Surrey, a private sixth form college known for its performing arts programme. There, she was discovered and signed by an agent.[17]  Career [ edit ]  2001–2004: Career beginnings [ edit ]  In November 2001, Blunt made her professional debut in Peter Hall's production of the play The Royal Family, in which she played the role of the granddaughter Gwen to Dench's Fanny Cavendish. Critic Tom Keatinge hailed the production, writing that ""Peter Hall's direction and Anthony Ward's tremendous set combine with all this to make The Royal Family a terrific night's entertainment"", and that ""it provides a vehicle for acting of the finest quality, with strong performances from the whole ensemble"".[18] For her performance, Blunt was named ""Best Newcomer"" by the Evening Standard. She went on to perform as Eugenie in Nicholas Wright's Vincent in Brixton at the National Theatre, and as Juliet in Indhu Rubasingham's production of Romeo and Juliet at Chichester Festival Theatre, both in 2002.[19] In 2003, Blunt made her screen debut in the British television drama Boudica, about the life of the ancient Celtic warrior-queen who fought the Romans. That same year, she was praised for her performance as the 16th-century Queen Catherine Howard in the two-part British television drama Henry VIII.[19]  In 2004, Blunt received considerable attention for her performance as Tamsin in the independent British drama My Summer of Love, a love story revolving around two young women from different socioeconomic backgrounds in the English countryside.[19] Director Paweł Pawlikowski gave high praise to Blunt and co-star Natalie Press, stating in an interview that ""Both Natalie and Emily were extremely different and very original, which is a rare thing nowadays. They avoid the obvious, and are capable of playing complex and conflicting attitudes. Above all, they had energy, which is key for a movie."" James Berardinelli of ReelViews praised the film, calling it a ""gem"" lost in the ""hype"" of Hollywood blockbusters, and noted that ""Both Natalie Press and Emily Blunt [...] are superlative. They nail their cinematic alter-egos effortlessly, using verbal and non-verbal cues to tap into their emotions. They understand their characters and use their talents to bring them to life.""[20] She shared the Evening Standard British Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer with Press.[21]  2005–2010: The Devil Wears Prada and breakthrough [ edit ]  Blunt starred in the British television drama Gideon's Daughter,[19] based on an original screenplay written and directed by Stephen Poliakoff, where she played the troubled only child of New Labour spin doctor Gideon Warner. The film premiered at the Hamptons International Film Festival in 2005, and debuted on British television in February 2006. The drama was praised for its overall ""sterling performances,""[22] and Blunt won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film.[23]  She then featured in the comedy-drama The Devil Wears Prada, set in the fashion world in New York City. Blunt played Emily, the senior assistant of Runway magazine editor-in-chief Miranda Priestly. The film was a commercial and critical success, grossing $326,551,094.[24] Though co-star Meryl Streep garnered most of the attention for her role, Blunt's performance was equally praised, with Clifford Pugh of the Houston Chronicle asserting that ""[Blunt] has many of the movie's best lines and steals nearly every scene she's in.""[25] Blunt was nominated the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture for her performance. She attended the 79th Academy Awards where she co-presented the award for best costume design with Hathaway, with both acting as their characters from the film.[26] Blunt then appeared in the independent mystery drama Irresistible.  Blunt's profile continued to rise, and in 2007, she appeared in four films: the horror film Wind Chill, the romantic drama The Jane Austen Book Club, the comedy-drama Dan in Real Life, and the biographical comedy-drama Charlie Wilson's War.[19] In 2008, Blunt appeared in two films, Sunshine Cleaning in the role of Norah Lorkowski, an underachiever who starts a crime-scene clean-up business with her sister Rose, played by Amy Adams. The film premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, where it received positive reviews, particularly for Adams' and Blunt's performances. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine commented ""This funny and touching movie depends on two can-do actresses to scrub past the biohazard of noxious clichés that threaten to intrude. Adams and Blunt get the job done.""[27] A. O. Scott of The New York Times agreed, stating ""Amy Adams and Emily Blunt [...] attack their roles with vivacity and dedication...""[28] She then starred in The Great Buck Howard as Valerie Brennan, which premiered at the same festival.[19]  In 2009, Blunt portrayed Queen Victoria in the independent period drama The Young Victoria, directed by Jean-Marc Vallée and written by Julian Fellowes, which focused primarily on her early life and reign, as well as her marriage to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.[29] Blunt admitted to having little prior knowledge of the Queen, but after consulting her mother, found her to be ""remarkable"" and ""a very 21st century sort of woman.""[30] Blunt's performance earned critical accolades, and she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama[31] and Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress,[32] among others. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly concluded that ""Director Jean-Marc Vallée's images have a creamy stateliness, but this is no gilded princess fantasy – it's the story of a budding ruler who learns to control her surroundings, and Blunt makes that journey at once authentic and relevant.""[33] That same year, Blunt received the BAFTA Britannia Award for British Artist of the Year.[34]  She starred in the Toby Spanton-directed short film Curiosity, and was director Jon Favreau's first choice to play Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow in Iron Man 2, but due to scheduling conflicts with her role in the comedy Gulliver's Travels, she was forced to yield the role to Scarlett Johansson.[35] She also voiced Matilda Mouseling, the mother of the titular character, in the television series Angelina Ballerina: The Next Steps. In 2010, Blunt co-starred in the horror film The Wolfman, a re-adaptation of the classic 1941 film of the same name. The film received mainly negative reviews, and according to the Los Angeles Times, was one of the largest box-office failures of all time.[36][37] Her performance in the thriller The Adjustment Bureau (2011) fared better: in the film, Blunt played a dancer who is ""being mysteriously kept apart"" from a politician. The film earned generally positive reviews, with critics praising Blunt and co-star Matt Damon's chemistry.[38] Blunt was offered the role of Agent Peggy Carter in Captain America: The First Avenger, but like the offer for Iron Man 2, she turned it down.[39]  2011–2014: Science fiction and comedies [ edit ]  In 2011, Blunt starred in the British romantic comedy-drama Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, directed by Lasse Hallström and co-starring Ewan McGregor. She played a financial adviser who recruits a fisheries expert, played by McGregor, to help realise a sheikh's vision of bringing the sport of fly fishing to the Yemen desert, resulting in a spiritual journey for both in the process.[40] The film premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival,[41] receiving positive reviews, as did Blunt's and McGregor's performances. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times noted ""Blunt and McGregor are two of the most gifted and attractive actors working today, able to play off each other with great style...""[42] Blunt was nominated the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for her performance. Also that year, she made a cameo appearance in Disney's The Muppets, as Miss Piggy's receptionist, and starred in the independent comedy-drama Your Sister's Sister.[43] In November 2011, Blunt was named the ambassador of the new Yves Saint Laurent fragrance Opium.[44]  In 2012, Blunt starred in the romantic comedy The Five-Year Engagement, directed by Nicholas Stoller and co-starring Jason Segel, in which she and Segel played a couple whose relationship becomes strained when their engagement is continually extended. The film earned positive reviews, with Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News remarking that ""Blunt has never been more relaxed, and she and Segel have a believably warm chemistry.""[45] She then starred in Looper, a science fiction action film directed by Rian Johnson. Blunt played Sara, a tough farm woman and single mother, who aids and falls in love with a time-traveller. The film premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival, where it served as the opening film, and earned highly positive feedback. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter credited Blunt for ""effectively [revealing] Sara's tough and vulnerable sides.""[46] Also that year, she starred in the comedy-drama Arthur Newman as the troubled Charlotte, who is trying to run away from her past.[47] The film received generally mixed to negative reviews.[48][49]  In 2014, Blunt starred in Edge of Tomorrow, a film adaptation of the Japanese novel All You Need Is Kill, written by Hiroshi Sakurazaka.[50] Blunt played Sergeant Rita Vrataski, a Special Forces warrior tasked with training a public relations officer to defeat invading extraterrestrials. Blunt trained three months for her role, ""focusing on everything from weights to sprints to yoga, aerial wire work and gymnastics"", and studying Krav Maga.[51] The film was commercially successful, grossing $370,541,256,[52] and earned positive reviews. Many critics took note of the atypically dominating role portrayed by Blunt, and Justin Chang of Variety noted that ""Blunt is alert, energized and emotionally present in a none-too-taxing role.""[53] For her performance, Blunt won the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie.[54] A sequel is currently in development, with Blunt expected to reprise her role.[55]  Blunt then played the role of the Baker's Wife in The Walt Disney Company's film adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's musical Into the Woods, directed by Rob Marshall and featuring an ensemble cast.[56][57] Ironically, Blunt was pregnant throughout filming, while playing a character who is barren throughout the film's first act.[58][59] The film was a commercial success and earned generally positive reviews, with Blunt earning praise for her acting and singing. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post felt it was one of the best female performances of the year,[60] while Richard Corliss of Time remarked that ""When Blunt is onscreen, these woods are alive with the magic of a fractured fairy tale...""[61] She was nominated for her second Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for her performance.[62]  2015–present: Dramatic expansion and recognition [ edit ]  In 2015, Blunt starred in the crime thriller Sicario, directed by Denis Villeneuve. Blunt played Kate Macer, a principled FBI agent assigned to take down the leader of a powerful Mexican drug cartel. The film was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, where it received critical acclaim. Blunt received considerable praise for her performance, with Dan Jolin of Empire magazine calling it ""nuanced"", and stating that ""Her straight-arrow-sharp determination becomes painfully dulled,""[63] and while Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian found her character implausible, he praised Blunt for ""[brazening] out any possible absurdity with great acting focus and front.""[64] Blunt was nominated for her second consecutive Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie.[65]  In 2016, Blunt co-starred in The Huntsman: Winter's War, which serves as both a prequel and sequel to Snow White and the Huntsman (2012). The film, directed by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan, was a box-office bomb and was mostly dismissed by critics.[66][67] Blunt then headlined the mystery thriller The Girl on the Train, directed by Tate Taylor. Based on the best-selling novel of the same name, written by Paula Hawkins, Blunt plays Rachel Watson, an alcoholic who becomes involved in a missing persons investigation. Though the film earned mixed reviews from critics, who felt that it failed to live up to the novel, Blunt received unanimous praise for her performance. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone remarked that ""the movie gives away the game faster than the novel, but Emily Blunt digs so deep into the role of a blackout drunk and maybe murderer that she raises Girl to the level of spellbinder.""[68] For her work in The Girl on the Train, she received nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress and Screen Actors Guild Award (SAG) for Outstanding Female Actor.[69][70]  Blunt in 2018  After providing her voice for the 2017 animated films My Little Pony: The Movie and Animal Crackers, Blunt made her return to the screen, in husband John Krasinski's 2018 horror film A Quiet Place, which centers on a family being tormented by monstrous creatures that hunt by sound.[71] Neither Krasinski nor Blunt had any initial plans for Blunt to co-star in the film with him; upon reading the script, Blunt persuaded Krasinski to cast her.[72] A Quiet Place served as the opening night film at the South by Southwest Film Festival, where it generated critical acclaim.[73][74] Eric Kohn of IndieWire applauded the cast for contributing ""credible intensity to their scenes with a degree of sophistication rare for this type of material,"" while Laura Prudom of IGN noted that, ""Blunt, in particular, is put through the wringer in ways that would seem almost farcical, if she didn't play them with such compelling conviction"".[75][76]  That same year, Blunt played the title character in Rob Marshall's musical fantasy film Mary Poppins Returns, which served as a sequel to the 1964 film, in which Poppins was played by Julie Andrews.[77] Writing for Variety, Owen Gleiberman found Blunt to be ""practically perfect in every way"" and added that she ""inhabits Mary Poppins' snappishly entrancing spirit, and in the musical numbers she generates her own spit-spot radiance"".[78] She received SAG nominations for both A Quiet Place and Mary Poppins Returns, winning for the former, and was nominated for a Golden Globe for the sixth time, for the latter.[79][80]  In 2020, Blunt guest starred in her husband's web series Some Good News, which began streaming on YouTube during the COVID-19 pandemic.[81] She will reprise her role in the horror sequel A Quiet Place Part II. She will also co-star in Jungle Cruise, a film adaptation of the eponymous attraction in Adventureland[82][83] and star in the romantic drama Wild Mountain Thyme, based on John Patrick Shanley's play Outside Mullingar, and in the BBC television series The English, a western from Hugo Blick.[84][85]  Personal life [ edit ]  Blunt had a three-year relationship with Canadian singer Michael Bublé. They met in 2005, while backstage at the Australian television Logie Awards in Melbourne. They later shared a home in Vancouver, British Columbia, before breaking up in 2008.[86]  In November 2008, Blunt began dating American actor John Krasinski. They became engaged in August 2009,[87] and married on 10 July 2010 in Como, Italy.[88] They reside in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of New York City, and have two daughters, one born in 2014 and the other in 2016.[89][90]  In August 2015, Blunt became a naturalised citizen of the United States.[91] She took dual citizenship in the United States, suggesting the status helped her tax situation. She said she felt conflicted over abandoning her sole allegiance to the United Kingdom.[92]  In 2015, Blunt was listed 98th in FHM's Sexiest Women of 2015.[93]  Acting credits and awards [ edit ]  According to the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes and the box-office site Box Office Mojo, Blunt's most critically acclaimed and commercially successful films include the comedy-drama The Devil Wears Prada (2006), the science fiction films Looper (2012) and Edge of Tomorrow (2014), the musical fantasy Into the Woods (2014), the crime thriller Sicario (2015), the mystery thriller The Girl on the Train (2016), the horror film A Quiet Place (2018), and the musical fantasy Mary Poppins Returns (2018).[94][95]",fake
18958,"Julianna Margulies, who plays Kitty Montgomery on AMC’s Dietland, talks about Kitty’s world and what Plum Kettle represents to women everywhere.  Q: Kitty is such a unique personality. How did you create such a big persona right out of the box?  A: Kitty’s not as prominent in the book as she is on the TV show. When I met Sarai Walker, I asked her about Kitty. It seemed like [Writer/Executive Producer] Marti [Noxon] was very specific in how she wanted to cast Kitty, and she was very specific in how she was writing Kitty, but it didn’t seem to be as big an issue in the book. I asked Sarai what her idea was when she was writing Kitty. She told me she’s actually based on a real-life person and that the first character she wrote in the book was Kitty because it had the most profound effect on her in her life. What I wanted to do, most of all, was not make her an Anna Wintour or Glenda Bailey or Grace Coddington. Even though I read everything I could on them, I wanted to fit her into this world that Plum is living in and weigh the balance of what Plum is going through with the balance of what Kitty is going through. Her world is so completely superficial. She’s always posing. She has to be picture perfect as if she were in a photoshoot. You’ll see over the course of the ten episodes that when she forgets herself and gets emotionally involved, it goes away. It’s very uncomfortable, let me tell you. [Laughs]  Q: Had you read the book before signing on for the project?  A: The first time I heard about it was from Marti herself. I read the book right after I read the first five scripts. I was really impressed with how true to the book it was. I think the real weight falls on Marti and on Joy [Nash] because the writing of the book and the main character are so rich. If we didn’t replicate the rich life that the book has for Plum Kettle and the world you enter in the book, it really wouldn’t do the book justice. Sometimes the stars just align with the right casting. Marti and Joy really nailed it. I cannot imagine another person in Plum Kettle’s shoes than Joy Nash, honestly.  Q: Although she’s so self-involved, she does keep referring to “her girls.” What do they represent to her?  A: She’s very proud of her girls. She calls them her girls because she feels that she’s created them and given them a platform. It’s quite hypocritical, really, because what she’s done – in her Kitty way – is create this false narrative within the magazine industry. Everyone in her magazine looks perfect, but she’s opened up a venue for these girls to write letters and ask advice to become these perfect people. In Kitty’s world, Kitty is perfect – except for the fact that she’s aging, which kills her. She had the smarts to hire someone like Plum Kettle, who can answer these letters much better than she can. She actually found an overweight girl who can see the world the same way her girls see the world.  Q: Kitty has risen to the top with Daisy Chain at Austin Media. How would you describe what she’s up against and how that might shape her character?  A: Smiling and being polite and saying “yes sir” or “no sir,” knowing that she was ten times better than any of the men at her job – I think that’s what a lot of women face at any job. I equate it to Ginger Rogers in that she had to do exactly what Fred Astaire was doing but backward and in high heels. That’s what women do in the workplace. We’re constantly tap dancing backward in high heels to prove ourselves.  Q: In Episode 2, Kitty denies Plum the chance to attend the plus-size fashion show. What’s the underlying dynamic at play between these two?  A: I think Kitty is truly aghast at what Plum looks like. They’re selling makeup and diets and how to be a perfect woman, which means you’re a size two, and you have flawless skin. When you first meet Kitty, and she sees Plum and says, “I always forget how beautiful your eyes are,” what she wants to say is, “I always forget how fat you are.” Kitty realizes she can cash in on the plus-size revolution, but god forbid Plum represents the magazine. That would never happen. Plum Kettle is the antithesis of Daisy Chain.  Q: What was it like filming in that huge beauty closet? Any behind-the-scenes details of how it all came together?  A: That beauty closet is like me in a candy store. [Laughs] I was testing everything I could. My hands were so soft while we were filming! I’d actually never seen one, and I didn’t realize they actually exist. I was stunned. You feel like if you stayed there, you would always come out dewy and soft. It’s remarkable, but it also makes you realize what a crock of sh-t it all is.  Q: What do you hope people connect to the most? What do you hope the show changes about any current narratives?  A: I think the character of Plum Kettle is going to change women’s lives. You start with a character who is waiting for her life to start once she becomes a certain size and what Plum develops into is a person who realizes life can start right now. To give that kind of confidence to young women in a world that is so judgmental and so critical of every single thing on a woman’s body, of the way they talk, of the way they think, of the way they’re supposed to act – I think that this show is actually really enlightening for so many women across the board. And I don’t just think it’s overweight women. I think it’s all of us. We all have our hang-ups. Everyone thinks someone else’s life is better. Your life started the day you were born. Isn’t that good enough?  I feel like this show is going to fire some people up. Even though this book came out in 2015, it could not be more timely. It’s bizarre for me, having come from a show wherein we kept wondering if year after year it was going to stay relevant and year after year, yet another politician was caught with his pants down. It’s the same thing now. Every month, it’s another high-profile person who has abused their use of power. I feel incredibly fortunate that I keep getting led to these on-topic moments that sustain themselves through time because until we talk about it, it’s just not going to change.

19750,"EXCLUSIVE  7/21 7:30 AM PT -- Bail was just set at $17k.  7/21 6:47 AM PT -- Police say Offset had 3 handguns in the vehicle and $107,000.  3:46 PM PT -- Offset was hit with 4 charges ... possession of a firearm by a felon, possession of a weapon during a crime -- both felonies -- and possession of marijuana (one ounce or less), and an improper lane change ... both misdemeanors.  The rapper was apparently pulled over for the lane change, not for tinted windows.  Offset is behind bars in Georgia after cops pulled him over and allegedly discovered at least one weapon.  Sources tell us the Migos rapper was traveling just outside Atlanta Friday when the vehicle he was in was pulled over for tinted windows. A witness tells us officers then discovered at least one gun in the car ... a big no-no for Offset, who is a convicted felon.  Offset and Cardi B welcomed their daughter, Kulture, into the world earlier this month ... we're told neither Cardi nor the baby were in the vehicle at the time of Offset's arrest.

""You know, I was with the same person for 10 years and that was quite a turmoil, very intense. That's all I can say about it. I'd like to say a lot more, but we're on this show—let's keep it P.C.

""I am being very honest about drinking to numb my pain, but that is just a way a lot of people mask what is really going on.""

Wait — strike that:  Gigi Hadid hit social media Monday to teach body-shamers a lesson they obviously deserve because the world should always be kind, gentle and supportive. And criticism-free.  Whew, that feels so much better.  The 20-year-old fashion model, who clocks in at 5-foot-10 and has already taken a daring stand about wanting to weigh more than ""2 pounds soaking wet,"" explained that despite being essentially superhuman, she's also just human.  ""Yes, judgment on social media comes from people who, 99% of the time, have no idea what they're talking about, but I'm human, and I'm not going to lie, I did let the negativity get to me a little,"" she wrote. ""I came to a realization that when one gets to this point, it's important to rethink why you're doing what you do. What your message is. What you have to say.""

Also, she doesn't think she's the best model in every show but does think she needs to improve her runway walk.  A photo posted by Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid) on Sep 28, 2015 at 4:25am PDT  That said, any and all critics should get over themselves. ""If you don't like it, don't follow me, don't watch me, cause I'm not going anywhere,"" she said. ""If I didn't have the body I do, I wouldn't have the career I do. I love that I can be sexy. I'm proud of it.""  Hadid, who's BFFs with people like Taylor Swift, dates people like Joe Jonas and along with Kendall Jenner is kind of the model of the moment, has previously defended her looks.  ""I just want to be a healthy role model and I haven't swayed from that at all,"" she told the Daily Mail Australia in an August interview that also saw her describing the ""huge thighs"" she had as a Junior Olympian and explaining that she eats burgers regularly but then uses the Master Cleanse lemon-cayenne-and-maple-syrup liquid diet to snap back into shape for runway shows.  Tyra Banks, modeling's house mother, was supportive of Hadid's message on Monday.  ""I haven't met you yet @gighadid but I FEEL you so much,"" the ""America's Next Top Model"" star wrote when she regrammed the post. ""Your words are powerful. Your words are necessary. Your words are vulnerable. Your words are real. Sending you love and hugs. From one model that had curves and a unique walk to another, Tyra.""  Kris Jenner also had Gigi's back on Instagram, reposting the missive and adding, ""This is from one of the sweetest, smartest, and most beautiful girl inside and out, in the world. Why do people with no life, no purpose, who are angry and bitter and ignorant, or just plain nasty and mean, choose to bring everyone else down instead of finding the best in others? I will never understand the BULLYS that lurk on Instagram just to try and ruin someone else's spirit. If all of their horrible negative energy was focused on being positive and seeing good, imagine what a better more peaceful place this world would be.""

1117,"Mel Gibson says that the sexual abuse scandal in Hollywood is going to get worse, claiming that tinsel town pedophiles have “nowhere left to hide.”  Speaking at the Dublin premiere of his new film Daddy’s Home 2, the star was asked by Newstalk Breakfast’s Henry McKean about the current atmosphere in Hollywood.  Newstalk.com reports: Gibson said that he hopes there will be a positive outcome for victims of sexual harassment or assault who are now coming forward.  He said: “I think a lot of light’s being shined into a lot of dark places right now – and rightfully so.  “It’s tragic in a sense, because a lot of the poor victims have to relive it. [It’s] torturous for them – but they’ll get free by re-examining it.”  Comeback  Gibson’s career stalled in 2006 when he was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, and was recorded making anti-Semitic remarks following the arrest.  After a half-decade off screens, Gibson has made a gradual comeback in recent years – culminating in several Oscar nominations, including Best Film and Best Director, for his most recent directorial effort Hacksaw Ridge.  Talking about his own comeback, he simply said: “You just don’t stop breathing.”  You can listen back to Henry’s full report from the Daddy’s Home 2 premiere below:",fake
13697,"For Margot Robbie, it’s not all glitz and glamor. The actress, who played Harley Quinn in the film ‘Suicide Squad,’ just shared what her one regret is for taking on the role of the supervillain character.  In her recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Robbie opened up about having stalkers and receiving death threats after starring in the film. Her popularity comes with a price, and it definitely isn’t cheap.  “There’s just all this stuff you learn along the way, like, when you get those death threats, it’s [smart] to have a security team do a background check on whoever sent them to see if there is any past history of violence because you’ll need to know whether you need security to go to certain events,” she told The Hollywood Reporter. “And every time you do a background check, it’s going to cost $2,000, so take that into consideration when you’re getting yourself into this.”  Having said that, Robbie actually regrets not having someone who explained these kinds of things to her before she joined the DC universe.  “I wouldn’t have resented the position I found myself in because I would’ve known what I was getting myself into,” the actress shared.  Despite her one regret, Margot Robbie is still on to polishing her celebrity status, as she recently took on the role of an abused and a disgraced figure skater in the movie ‘I, Tonya.’  What do you think of Margot Robbie’s latest confession?

14246,"American former physician and convicted sex offender  Lawrence Gerard Nassar (born August 16, 1963) is a former USA Gymnastics national team doctor and osteopathic physician at Michigan State University, and convicted sex offender. Nassar's cumulative sexual assault crimes were the basis of the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal that began in 2015, in which he was accused of assaulting at least 250 young women and girls dating back to 1992.[2] His victims included numerous Olympic and United States women's national gymnastics team gymnasts,[3] and he has admitted to 10 of those accusations.  Nassar was sentenced to 60 years in federal prison in July 2017 after pleading guilty to child pornography charges. On January 24, 2018, Nassar was sentenced to 175 years in a Michigan state prison after pleading guilty to seven counts of sexual assault of minors.[4][5] On February 5, 2018, he was sentenced to an additional 40 to 125 years in prison after pleading guilty to an additional three counts of sexual assault.[6] His state prison sentences are to run consecutively with his federal sentence, all but assuring that he will die in prison.[7][5]  Personal life  Nassar was born on August 16, 1963 in Farmington Hills, Michigan, to Fred Nassar (1925–2000) and Mary Nassar (1924–2019),[8] who are both of Lebanese descent.[9] He began working as a student athletic trainer for the women's gymnastics team at North Farmington High School at age 15 in 1978, on the recommendation of his older brother Mike who was an athletic trainer at the school. Nassar graduated from North Farmington High School in 1981.[10][11] He studied kinesiology at the University of Michigan, where he earned his undergraduate degree in 1985.[11] During this time he worked for the university's football and track & field teams.[12]  He married Stephanie Lynn Anderson on October 19, 1996, at St. John's Catholic Church in East Lansing, and they have two daughters and a son.[10] The couple separated after he was arrested on suspicion of sex crimes, with Stephanie Nassar being granted a divorce in July 2017 and gaining full custody of their three children.[13][14]  Nassar lived in Holt, Michigan at the time of his arrest in December 2016.[10] Despite having been publicly charged with sex crimes, Nassar ran for the Holt School Board in 2016, and received 21% of the vote.[12]  Medical career  Nassar began working as an athletic trainer for the USA Gymnastics national team in 1986, .[12] In 1993 he graduated from the Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine as a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine. He completed his residency training in family practice at St. Lawrence Hospital before completing a fellowship in sports medicine in 1997.[12]  He began working as an assistant professor at MSU's Department of Family and Community Medicine in the College of Human Medicine in 1997, where he earned $100,000 a year.[10] Nassar is listed as a co-author on at least six research papers on the treatment of gymnastics injuries.[15] He began working as a team doctor at Holt High School in 1996.[12]  Gymnastics career  In 1988, Nassar began working with John Geddert at Twistars, a gymnastics training club.[12] He served as the national medical coordinator for USA Gymnastics from 1996 until 2014.[12]  Sexual assault accusations and convictions  Accusations  While some gymnasts have said they complained in the 1990s about Nassar's behavior, it was not until 2015 that USA Gymnastics took action against him. The organization cut ties with Nassar ""after learning of athlete concerns.""[16] In September 2016, The Indianapolis Star reported that Rachael Denhollander and another former gymnast had accused Nassar of sexual abuse.[17] He was fired by Michigan State on September 20, after having been reassigned from clinical and teaching duties a month earlier.[16]  In February 2017 three former gymnasts: Jeanette Antolin, Jessica Howard and Jamie Dantzscher, gave an interview for 60 Minutes in which they said that Nassar had sexually abused them. They also alleged that the ""emotionally abusive environment"" at the national team training camps run by Béla and Márta Károlyi, at the Karolyi Ranch near Huntsville, Texas, gave Nassar an opportunity to take advantage of the gymnasts and made them afraid to speak up about the abuse.[18] Rachael Denhollander, one of the first women to publicly accuse Nassar,[19] said in court in May 2017 that Nassar had sexually abused her on five doctor's visits in 2000 when she was 15 years old.[20]  Olympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney, using the #MeToo hashtag on Twitter, said that Nassar had repeatedly molested her from 2008, when she was 13 years old, until she retired from the sport eight years later in 2016.[21] Maroney subsequently filed a lawsuit against Nassar, Michigan State University, the United States Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics.[22] The lawsuit accused USA Gymnastics of covering up the sexual abuse by requiring her to sign a non-disclosure agreement in her $1.25 million settlement. Maroney's attorney John Manly called Nassar a ""pedophile doctor"".[23]  During a 60 Minutes interview, Olympic gold medalist Aly Raisman said that Nassar had also sexually abused her.[24] Raisman said that Nassar molested her when she was 15 years old.[25] Gabby Douglas sent a tweet saying that ""dressing in a provocative/sexual way incites the wrong crowd.""[26] She was criticized for it by fellow Olympic teammate Simone Biles and others, who interpreted the tweet as criticism of Raisman and ""victim-shaming"".[25] Douglas later apologized for the tweet,[27] and said she was also a victim of Nassar's abuse.[28]  Former national team member Maggie Nichols said that Nassar abused her, and that he ""groomed"" her by connecting with her on Facebook and complimenting her appearance on numerous occasions.[3] According to court filings and interviews, Nichols and her coach Sarah Jantzi reported Nassar to USA Gymnastics officials on June 17, 2015 after the coach overheard Nichols and another gymnast talking about Nassar's behavior.[29] Biles came forward shortly after with accounts that she too had been sexually abused by Nassar.[30] Jordyn Wieber made an impact statement at Nassar's court sentencing in which she also accused Nassar of sexually abusing her during her time at USA Gymnastics and talked of its effects.[31][32]  Convictions  Nassar was indicted in November 2016, on several state charges of ""sexual assault of a child"" from 1998 to 2005. The crimes allegedly began when the victim was six years old.[33] He was charged with 22 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with minors: fifteen in Ingham County and seven in neighboring Eaton County. The allegations asserted that Nassar had molested seven girls under the guise that he was providing legitimate medical treatment, both at his home and at a clinic on the MSU campus.[34]  Nassar was arrested in December 2016 after the FBI found more than 37,000 images of child pornography and a video of Nassar molesting underage girls.[35] On April 6, 2017, his medical license was revoked for three years.[36] Nassar pleaded guilty on July 11 to receiving child pornography in 2004, possession of pornographic images of children dating from 2004 to 2016, and tampering with evidence by destroying and concealing the images. Judge Janet T. Neff sentenced Nassar to 60 years in federal prison on December 7, 2017.[7] If he survives the sentence, he will be on supervised release for the rest of his life.[7]  Nassar pleaded guilty in Ingham County Circuit Court, on November 22, 2017, to seven counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with minors under the age of sixteen. He admitted to molesting seven girls, three of whom were under the age of thirteen. He pleaded guilty to an additional three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct in Eaton County on November 29.[37] As of January 18, 2018, 135 women had accused Nassar of sexual assault while he worked for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University.[38] During the following week, the number rose to 150.[39] In a lawsuit that was filed in April 2017, a woman claimed that Nassar had sexually assaulted her while he was still in medical school in 1992.[2]  On January 24, 2018, Judge Rosemarie Aquilina sentenced Nassar to 40 to 175 years in prison for the sexual assault of minors.[4] Aquillina allowed Nassar's accusers to present extended victim impact statements and dismissed objections raised to this ruling by Nassar.[38] During the sentencing, the judge informed Nassar that he had missed numerous chances to receive treatment for his sexual urges, as Nassar had been aware of these urges himself from a young age. She also said that there were likely dozens of additional victims who had not come forward, and made it clear that Nassar will never be free again.[5]  Nassar was practicing without a Texas medical license while he worked at the Karolyi Ranch in Huntsville. According to McKayla Maroney, this was where Nassar molested young women for more than 15 years. Practicing medicine without a license in Texas is a third-degree felony, although it is rarely prosecuted.[40] On January 31, 2018, a Michigan judge said that there were ""over 265 identified victims and an infinite number of victims"" of sexual misconduct.[41]  On February 5, 2018, Judge Janice Cunningham of Eaton County sentenced Nassar to 40 to 125 years in prison for the three counts of criminal sexual assault to which he had pleaded in November.[42] Nassar apologized for his years of abuse, saying that the strong effects that his victims' statements had on him ""pales in comparison"" to the suffering he inflicted on them. Despite this, Cunningham stated that Nassar was still in ""denial"" about the ""devastating impact"" of his crimes.[6] The Eaton County sentence will run concurrently with the Ingham County sentence. Nassar's state sentences will begin upon completion of his federal child pornography sentence. Neff ordered any sentences imposed at the state level to run consecutively with the federal sentence.[7][5][42] As a result, Nassar will serve a minimum of 100 years in prison, as each individual sentence will be enough by itself to ensure that he will die in prison.[6]  Nassar was transferred to the United States Penitentiary (USP) in Tucson, Arizona in February 2018.[43] He had been transferred prior to this from Eaton county jail to the federal detention center at FCI Milan near Milan, Michigan. In August 2018, The Detroit News reported that Nassar was transferred to the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. According to his lawyers, Nassar was assaulted almost as soon as he was placed in the general population at USP Tucson, and an investigation subsequently determined that Nassar could not be safely held at Tucson.[44] As a result, he was moved to the United States Penitentiary, Coleman in Florida.[45] His earliest possible release date from federal custody is March 23, 2069. If he is still alive at this point, he will be 105 years old and will be immediately transferred to a Michigan state prison to serve out his state sentences.  Aftermath  More than 150 federal and state lawsuits have since been filed against Nassar, Michigan State University, the US Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics, and the Twistars Gymnastics Club.[46] The entire 18-member board of USA Gymnastics, including Steve Penny, tendered their resignations. MSU President Lou Anna Simon and MSU Director of Athletics Mark Hollis have both resigned, and other MSU officials are also under scrutiny.[47]  Nassar's crimes committed at MSU and USA Gymnastics have drawn comparisons to coach Jerry Sandusky's sexual abuse crimes at Penn State University.[48] In both of these cases, mistakes were made when institutional authorities ""turned the other way"" or tried to hide the activities of a child molester instead of immediately contacting law enforcement.[49][50]  Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette promised a full investigation into how Nassar was able to abuse young women for decades while working at the state's university.[51] MSU agreed to pay $500 million to 332 alleged victims of Nassar, settling lawsuits filed by the victims. This was the largest amount of money in history settled by a university for a sexual abuse case.[52] On Christmas Eve 2019, Schuette's successor - Dana Nessel - announced that she was suspending the investigation.[53]  More than 140 survivors of Nassar's abuse appeared on stage together at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, California, on July 18, 2018, to receive the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage at the 2018 ESPY Awards ceremony. Gymnasts Sara Klein and Aly Raisman and softball player Tiffany Thomas Lopez accepted on the survivors’ behalf and served as spokeswomen. Klein identified herself as Nassar's first victim 30 years before.[54][55] They credited lead detective Andrea Munford of the Michigan State Police, former assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis, and Judge Rosemarie Aquilina of the 30th circuit court in Ingham County, Michigan, for their work. Aquilina also attended the ceremony, and singer MILCK performed her song ""Quiet”,[56] written from her own experience of sexual abuse.[57]  In late July 2018 it was reported that Nassar was seeking a new sentencing hearing due to concerns of perceived bias by Judge Aquilina,[58] but his request was later denied by Eaton County Judge Janice Cunningham.[59]",real

7854,"Television series season  The eighth and final season of the fantasy drama television series Game of Thrones, produced by HBO, premiered on April 14, 2019, and concluded on May 19, 2019. Unlike the first six seasons, which consisted of ten episodes each, and the seventh season, which consisted of seven episodes, the eighth season consists of only six episodes.  The final season depicts the culmination of the series' two primary conflicts: the Great War against the Army of the Dead, and the Last War for control of the Iron Throne. In the first half of the season, Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen and many of the main characters converge at Winterfell to face the Dead. During the long, bloody battle, which includes aerial combat by dragons, Bran lures the Night King into the open, where Arya destroys him; the army of White Walkers and wights crumble. Meanwhile, Cersei Lannister remains in King's Landing and strengthens her forces to set traps for a weakened Daenerys. The second half of the season resumes the war for the throne as Daenerys suffers losses until she finally assaults King's Landing on Drogon, her last dragon. She defeats Cersei's forces, burns the city and kills Cersei and her brother Jaime. Daenerys vows to ""liberate"" the whole world as she has liberated the capital of Westeros. Unable to sway her from her destructive path, an agonized Jon kills her. Drogon flies away with her body. The leaders of Westeros choose Bran Stark as King, who grants the North independence and appoints Tyrion his Hand. Sansa Stark is crowned Queen in the North. Arya sails west, and Jon leads the Wildlings north of the Wall.  The season was filmed from October 2017 to July 2018 and largely consists of original content not found in George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, while also incorporating material that Martin has revealed to showrunners about the upcoming novels in the series, The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring. The season was adapted for television by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss.  The season was met with mixed reviews from critics, in contrast to the widespread acclaim of previous seasons, and is the lowest-rated of the series on the website Rotten Tomatoes. While the performances, production values, cinematography, and music score were praised, criticism was mainly directed at the writing and shorter runtime of the season, as well as numerous creative decisions made by the showrunners.  The season received 32 nominations at the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards, the most for a single season of television in history.[1] It won twelve, including Outstanding Drama Series and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for Peter Dinklage.

Her purpose served, Melisandre allows herself to die of old age. 71 4 ""The Last of the Starks"" David Nutter David Benioff & D. B. Weiss May 5, 2019 ( ) 11.80[6] The survivors mourn and burn the dead, then celebrate their victory. During the feast, Daenerys uplifts the mood by legitimizing Gendry as a Baratheon, naming him Lord of Storm's End. Arya gently declines Gendry's subsequent marriage proposal while Jaime and Brienne become lovers. To protect her claim to the throne, Daenerys asks Jon to conceal his true parentage. Bronn arrives and threatens Jaime and Tyrion, but spares them in exchange for being promised Highgarden castle. Jon reveals his true parentage to Sansa and Arya, swearing them to secrecy. Wanting Jon as king, Sansa tells Tyrion, who informs Varys. Arya and the Hound head for King's Landing, bent on revenge. Tormund returns north with the Wildlings, taking Ghost at Jon's request. Daenerys and her fleet set sail for King's Landing, while Jon leads the Northern army. At Dragonstone, Euron's navy ambushes Daenerys' fleet, killing Rhaegal with ship-mounted ballistas. Missandei is taken hostage. Daenerys considers seizing King's Landing using dragonfire. Varys and Tyrion debate whether Jon would be a better ruler than Daenerys. Jaime leaves to return to Cersei, despite Brienne's pleas to stay. Cersei refuses Daenerys' demand to surrender, and has Missandei beheaded before an enraged Daenerys and Grey Worm. 72 5 ""The Bells"" Miguel Sapochnik David Benioff & D. B. Weiss May 12, 2019 ( ) 12.48[7] Varys urges Jon to advance his claim, but Jon refuses to betray Daenerys. After Tyrion reveals Varys' plot, Daenerys executes Varys by dragonfire. Jaime is captured, but Tyrion releases him so Jaime can persuade Cersei to surrender the city and then escape Westeros together. Jaime, Arya, and the Hound each infiltrate King's Landing. Riding Drogon, Daenerys destroys the Iron Fleet and most of the city's defenses, allowing her army to enter. Cersei's forces are quickly overwhelmed and the city signals its surrender, but an enraged Daenerys begins leveling the city, burning soldiers and civilians. The allied army follows her lead, slaughtering anyone in their path, horrifying Tyrion and Jon. Jaime kills Euron but is himself mortally wounded. The Hound convinces Arya to abandon her longtime vendetta against Cersei and save herself; then he confronts the Mountain. The brothers ultimately perish after falling from a tower into flames.

Daenerys rallies the Unsullied and Dothraki, proclaiming she will lead them to ""liberate"" the entire world. Tyrion resigns as Hand and is imprisoned for treason.

Cast [ edit ]  Main cast [ edit ]  Recurring cast [ edit ]  The recurring actors listed here are those who appeared in season 8. They are listed by the region in which they first appear.  Production [ edit ]  Development [ edit ]  HBO announced the eighth and final season of the fantasy drama television series Game of Thrones in July 2016.[35][36] Like the previous season, it largely consists of original content not found in George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series.[37] As Benioff had verified in March 2015, the creators have talked with Martin about the end of the series, and they ""know where things are heading."" He explained that the ends of both the television and the book series would unavoidably be thematically similar, although Martin could still make some changes to surprise the readers.[38] When asked about why the television series is coming to an end, he said, ""this is where the story ends.""[39]  Crew [ edit ]  Series creators and executive producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss serve as showrunners for the eighth season. The directors for the eighth season were announced in September 2017. Miguel Sapochnik, who previously directed ""The Gift"" and ""Hardhome"" in the fifth season, as well as ""Battle of the Bastards"" and ""The Winds of Winter"" in the sixth season, returned to direct two episodes. David Nutter, who had directed two episodes each in the second, third, and fifth seasons, including ""The Rains of Castamere"" and ""Mother's Mercy"", directed three episodes for the eighth season. The final episode of the series was directed by Benioff and Weiss, who have previously co-directed two episodes, taking credit for one episode each.[40]  At the series' South by Southwest panel on March 12, 2017, Benioff and Weiss announced the writers for the series to be Dave Hill (episode 1) and Bryan Cogman (episode 2). The showrunners divided up the screenplay for the remaining four episodes amongst themselves.[41]  Writing [ edit ]  Writing for the eighth season started with a 140-page outline. Benioff said that the divvying up process and who should write what section became more difficult because ""this would be the last time that [they] would be doing this.""[42]  Filming [ edit ]  In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, HBO programming president Casey Bloys said that instead of the series finale's being a feature film, the final season would be ""six one-hour movies"" on television. He continued, ""The show has proven that TV is every bit as impressive and in many cases more so, than film. What they're doing is monumental.""[43] Filming officially began on October 23, 2017[44] and concluded in July 2018.[45] Many exterior scenes were filmed in Northern Ireland and a few in Dubrovnik, Croatia; Paint Hall Studios in Belfast were used for interior filming.[46] The direwolf scenes were filmed in Alberta, Canada.[47]  Casting [ edit ]  The eighth season saw the return of Tobias Menzies as Edmure Tully and Lino Facioli as Robin Arryn in the final episode, neither of whom appeared in the seventh season.[34] Marc Rissmann was cast as Harry Strickland, the commander of the Golden Company.[33]  Content [ edit ]  Co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss have said that the seventh and eighth seasons would likely comprise fewer episodes, saying that after the sixth season, they were ""down to our final 13 episodes after this season. We're heading into the final lap"".[48][49] Benioff and Weiss said that they were unable to produce 10 episodes in the series' usual 12 to 14-month timeframe, as Weiss explained, ""It's crossing out of a television schedule into more of a mid-range movie schedule.""[48] HBO confirmed in July 2016 that the seventh season would consist of seven episodes and would premiere later than usual in mid-2017 because of the later filming schedule.[50] Benioff and Weiss later confirmed that the eighth season would consist of six episodes and would premiere later than usual for the same reason.[51]  Benioff and Weiss said about the end of the series: ""From the beginning, we've wanted to tell a 70-hour movie. It will turn out to be a 73-hour movie, but it's stayed relatively the same of having the beginning, middle[,] and now we're coming to the end. It would have been really tough if we lost any core cast members along the way[;] I'm very happy we've kept everyone and we get to finish it the way we want to.""[51] The first two episodes are, respectively, 54 and 58 minutes long, while the final four episodes of the series are all more than an hour in length—episode three is 82 minutes (making it the longest episode of the series), episodes four and five are each 78 minutes,[52] and the final episode is 80 minutes.[53]  A two-hour documentary, Game of Thrones: The Last Watch, which documents the making of the eighth season, aired on May 26, the week after the series finale.[54]  Music [ edit ]  Ramin Djawadi returned as the series' composer for the eighth season.[55] The soundtrack album for the season was released digitally on May 19, 2019 and was released on CD on July 19, 2019.[56]  Release [ edit ]  Broadcast [ edit ]  The season premiered on April 14, 2019 in the United States on HBO.[57]  Marketing [ edit ]  On December 6, 2018, HBO released the first official teaser trailer for the eighth season.[58] A second teaser trailer was released on January 13, 2019, which announced the premiere date as April 14, 2019. The trailer was directed by David Nutter.[59] HBO released a promotional advertisement with Bud Light on February 3, 2019 during Super Bowl LIII.[60] Later, first-look photos of several main characters were released on February 6, 2019.[61] On February 28, posters of many of the main characters sitting upon the Iron Throne were released.[29] The official full trailer was released on March 5, 2019.[30]  Illegal distribution [ edit ]  The season premiere was reportedly pirated by nearly 55 million people within the first 24 hours of release. Of these numbers, 9.5 million downloads came from India, 5.2 million came from China, and 4 million came from the U.S.[62] On April 21, 2019, it was reported that the second episode of the season was illegally leaked online hours before it aired due to being streamed early on Amazon Prime Germany.[63] On May 5, 2019, it was reported that the fourth episode of the season was leaked online, with footage from the episode circulating on social media.[64]  Home media [ edit ]  The season was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on December 3, 2019.[65]  Reception [ edit ]  Critical response [ edit ]  The season received mixed reviews from critics.[66] On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an approval rating of 58% based on 18 reviews with an average rating of 6.5/10, the lowest rating for a season of Game of Thrones.[a] The website's critical consensus reads: ""Game of Thrones' final season shortchanges the women of Westeros, sacrificing satisfying character arcs for spectacular set-pieces in its mad dash to the finish line"".[68]  The first two episodes were met with mostly positive feedback. On Metacritic, the premiere garnered a score of 75 out of 100 based on 12 reviews, indicating ""generally favorable reviews.""[69] ""The Long Night"" was praised for the cinematography and grand scale of the battle between the living and the dead,[70] but was criticized for its lack of catharsis, disorienting lighting, and the anticlimactic ending of the White Walker storyline that had been built up for seven seasons.[71][72][73] ""The Last of the Starks"" and ""The Bells"" were criticized for their rushed pacing, writing, and deviation from character development, with ""The Last of the Starks"" being labeled as ""anticlimactic"" and ""a huge letdown.""[74][75][76][77][78] ""The Iron Throne"" was described as ""divisive"", and according to Rotten Tomatoes, the series finale represents ""a modest rebound"" but it ""went out with a whimper.""[79][80] ""The Bells"" and ""The Iron Throne"" are the worst-reviewed episodes of the entire series on the website, with an approval of 49% and 48% respectively, while the last four episodes of the season ""plunged to record low scores.""[74][81][82][83]      Game of Thrones (season 8): Critical reception by episode Season 8 (2019) : Percentage of positive reviews tracked by the website Rotten Tomatoes[68]  David Sims of The Atlantic wrote that the final season ""has been the same story over and over again: a lot of tin-eared writing trying to justify some of the most drastic story developments imaginable, as quickly as possible. As usual, the actors did their best with what was on the page.""[79] Lucy Mangan of The Guardian wrote that the final season ""has been a rushed business. It has wasted opportunities, squandered goodwill[,] and failed to do justice to its characters or its actors.""[84] Zack Beauchamp of Vox wrote that the final season ""dispensed almost entirely with trying to make sense of its characters' internal motivations — let alone the complex political reality that its psychological realism initially helped create.""[85]  Kelly Lawler of USA Today wrote that the series ultimately betrayed its ""identity"" of ""tragedy and injustice"" with a ""pandering"" ending.[86] Judy Berman of Time wrote that the series failed to complete the answer to ""conflicting ideas about freedom, justice and leadership""; these were themes that previously brought depth to the series.[87] Ellen Gray of the Philadelphia Inquirer and Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly agreed that the final season was not as complex as previous seasons.[88][89] Franich gave the final season, featuring ""big-huge set pieces,"" a 'C' rating. The final season's ""broseph mentality shined through,"" shunting the interaction between female characters. Additionally, Franich criticized Cersei doing nothing this season, as well as the ultimate focus ""on Jon Snow, the least complicated main character.""[89]  Huw Fullerton of Radio Times wrote that the eighth season was not ""Thrones at its best"" but still had ""some sort of ending for the characters."" For Fullerton, the season was ""like the finale — some bits I liked, one or two I loved, an awful lot that leaves me scratching my head.""[90]  Ratings [ edit ]  Audience response [ edit ]  A petition to HBO for ""competent writers"" to remake the eighth season of Game of Thrones in a manner ""that makes sense"" was started on Change.org after ""The Last of the Starks"" aired, but went viral after ""The Bells"" aired.[97][98] The petition described showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss as ""woefully incompetent writers"".[99][100][101][102] As of September 6, 2019, it has amassed over 1.73 million signatures.[97][101][103][104][105][106][107] Digital Spy reported that fans of the series criticized the season for the way it handled several character arcs and the ""rushed"" pacing.[97][108] The petition's creator stated that he never expected HBO to remake the season, but saw the petition as a message ""of frustration and disappointment at its core"".[97]  The petition was labelled as ""disrespectful to the crew and the filmmakers"" by actress Sophie Turner (who plays Sansa Stark),[109][110] ""ridiculous"", ""weird, juvenile"" by actor Isaac Hempstead Wright (who plays Bran Stark),[110][111] and ""rude"" by actor Jacob Anderson (who plays Grey Worm).[112] Emilia Clarke (who plays Daenerys Targaryen) indicated she was previously unaware of the petition, but gave a warmer response when she was asked what she would want to see happen if the eighth season were redone: ""I can only speak to my own character, and the people that I interact with on the show. But I would've loved some more scenes with me and Missandei. I would've loved some more scenes with me and Cersei"".[113]  Richard Roeper, writing for the Chicago Sun Times, wrote: ""Over the last 25+ years, I've reviewed thousands of movies and dozens of TV shows, and I don't think I've ever seen the level of fan (and to a lesser degree, critical) vitriol leveled at [this show] in recent weeks"". However, Roeper noted that social media was not yet widely used during much of this time period.[106]  Lenika Cruz, writing for The Atlantic, wrote that with the end of the series, ""there are folks who don't feel as though the hours and hours they've devoted to this show have been wasted"", but ""there are many others"" who felt the opposite.[79] Kelly Lawler of USA Today wrote that the ultimate ending of the series was not what fans ""signed up for"".[86]  CBS News has described several plot points that fans are dissatisfied with: the character arcs of Daenerys and Jaime; the fates of Jaime, Missandei, Rhaegal, and the Night King; the Battle of Winterfell being visually too dark; the ""basic existence of Euron Greyjoy""; and ""Jon's treatment of Ghost"".[101]  Cast response [ edit ]  In an interview published just as the final season premiered, Kit Harington said, ""whatever critic spends half an hour writing about this season and makes their [negative] judgement on it, in my head they can go fuck themselves. [...] I know how much work was put into this [...] Now if people feel let down by [this final season], I don't give a fuck—because everyone [working on the series] tried their hardest. That's how I feel. In the end, no one's bigger fans of the show than we are, and we're kind of doing it for ourselves.""[114]  In an interview with The New Yorker, Emilia Clarke said she had to hold back her innermost anxiety from Beyoncé: ""I was just, like, Oh, my God, my absolute idol in life is saying that she likes me, and I know for a fact that by the end of this season she's going to hate me. [...] All I wanted to scream was 'Please, please still like me even though my character turns into a mass-killing dictator! Please still think that I'm representing women in a really fabulous way.'""[113]  Nathalie Emmanuel, who played Missandei, was heartbroken when she read her character's sudden demise: ""...I think the fact that she died in chains when she was a slave her whole life, that for me was a pungent cut for that character, that felt so painful"". Emmanuel, who was the only woman of color who was a regular on the series for the last several seasons, said, ""It's safe to say that Game of Thrones has been under criticism for their lack of representation, and the truth of it is that Missandei and Grey Worm have represented so many people because there's only two of them.""[115]  Conleth Hill, who played Varys, told Entertainment Weekly that the seventh and eighth seasons were ""kind of frustrating"" and not his ""favorite"", noting that Varys ""kind of dropped off the edge"". Hill reacted with ""dismay"" to Varys apparently ""losing his knowledge"": ""If he was such an intelligent man and he had such resources, how come he didn't know about things?"" After being ""very bummed to not have a final scene with [Littlefinger]"", Hill was ""bummed not to have any reaction to [Littlefinger] dying, if he was [Varys'] nemesis"". Also, once the series ran out of book material as a source, Hill noted that ""special niche interest in weirdos wasn't as effective as it had been"". However, Hill was ""not dissatisfied on the whole"" regarding the series.[116]  Lena Headey had a ""mixed"" initial reaction to the manner of death of Cersei Lannister, the character she played. Headey would rather have Cersei die by ""some big piece or fight with somebody"". Eventually, fellow actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau persuaded Headey on how to appreciate the scene, and she said her eventual belief that ""it seemed like the perfect end for"" Cersei because Cersei and Jaime ""came into the world together and now they leave together"".[117]  Accolades [ edit ]  With 32 nominations, Game of Thrones broke the record of the most nominations received by a regular TV show in a single year.

4179,"For some reason, that picture sticks in my head. The one of Britney Spears attacking a car with an umbrella.  Go ahead and laugh if you want. I won’t blame you.  Still, the picture — it was all over the news — stops me. There she is, this pop princess, newly bald, dressed unglamorously in shorts and sweatshirt, rearing back with an umbrella, ready to give that car what it has coming. Supposedly, the vehicle belongs to a photographer who had been tailing her.  In that photo, there is something of the spoiled child lashing out. Something of the little girl, broken. Something of the baby crying for help.  As I said, I can’t blame you if you laugh. Blaming you would be hypocritical.  Britney Spears doesn’t get a lot of air time in my internal monologue. I don’t listen to her music or watch her videos. She’s a presence at the edge of consciousness, more famous for being pretty and showing skin and sowing scandal than for any intrinsic quality of her singing. Suffice it to say, Gladys Knight’s legacy is safe from her encroachment. Barbra Streisand does not suffer in the comparison.  To the degree I think about her at all, it’s usually as a laugh line. People ask if I miss being a pop music critic, having spent the first 18 years of my professional life in that capacity. I tell them I give thanks every morning that I don’t have to pretend to take Britney Spears seriously. It’s always good for a chuckle.  That’s what Spears was to me: a punchline.  Am I the only one? Or isn’t it true that between her two-day first marriage, her Madonna kiss on national television, her panties-optional dress code, she long ago became, even for her fans, a person whose attraction lay less in her modest talents than in the sense you never knew what she might do next? She was a little crazy. A little out of control. A little clueless in ways that made you feel better about the garbage of your own life.  As in, maybe I ain’t no Nobel Prize winner, but at least I have sense enough to wear underwear when I go out.  And you could say this, talk about her like she wasn’t in the room, because she was not, in some sense, real. Spears was an abstract, an idea. Not a troubled young woman who has been in and out of rehab in recent days, a woman for whom fame and fortune have apparently proven inadequate to fill the emptiness inside.  The abstraction is not surprising: whatever media touch, they objectify. Some years ago, I got an e-mail from an outraged reader who, as the saying goes, called me everything but a child of God. I e-mailed him back and we ended up having a perfectly civil exchange. I remember he seemed embarrassed, as if he had not quite realized that the byline represented an actual human being who might actually read his invective. He had hurled it at an idea of me.  But I am not an idea.  If that can be forgotten about someone whose claim to fame is just that he scribbles in newspapers, how much more easily is it forgotten about those who live in the klieg lights of real fame? What must it be like to have your marriage and divorce, your relationship with your parents and kids, your sagging backside and ballooning thighs, dissected by millions of strangers who think they know you? Does money make that OK? Do luxury and fame?  I wouldn’t think so. Life is not a show. But if we ever knew that, we forgot it in our rush to a day of ""reality"" television, tabloid journalism and famous for nothing celebrities. There is no reverence, no privacy, nothing held back as sacred. We ooh and ahh and laugh and point at the garbage of other lives, and forget that even the most famous person is still a person, not an idea.  Britney Jean Spears is not an idea.

Exposure to the sun's harmful UV rays boosts your risk of skin cancer, and studies suggest that people who use tanning beds triple their risk of melanoma .  That said, we get it: sometimes you still want that bronzed, just-back-from-the-beach glow (minus the skin cancer risk, of course). That's why there are hundreds of skin-safe self-tanners out there that can take you from pale and pasty to sunny and summery in minutes. But as anyone who's ever wound up with streaky, orange skin can attest, not all of these products are created equal.",real
2810,"Lindsay Lohan says she was “racially profiled” at London’s Heathrow Airport after flying in from Turkey because she was wearing a headscarf.  The Mean Girls actress, 30, said she was stopped by a woman who asked her to take her headscarf off. “She opened my passport and saw Lindsay Lohan and started immediately apologizing, but then said ‘But please take off your headscarf,'” Lohan told U.K. television show Good Morning Britain. She added: “And I did, it’s okay. But what scared me was in that moment — how would another woman who doesn’t feel comfortable taking off her headscarf feel?”  Lohan, who has been photographed carrying a Koran and says she finds “solace” studying the Muslim holy book, said she didn’t know why she was asked to take her headscarf off but found the experience “really jarring.” She told hosts Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid: “I’m from New York — I’m born and raised there, but I was a little intimidated.”  When Reid asked the Parent Trap star why she was wearing the headscarf, she said it was “out of respect” for the Turkish women she had met with on her trip. “I was… leaving Turkey and… when I see certain people I feel more comfortable acting the same way as the other women — that’s just a personal respect issue for me that I have,” she said.  When Morgan asked Lohan about her views on President Donald Trump, Lohan said she thought he should be given a fair chance. “I don’t agree with his policies and the things he is doing,” she said. “But at the end of the day he is the president right now. So what’s the point of picking on someone instead of seeing what they’re capable — or not capable — of.” However, she added that she did think his Twitter account should be taken away “or deleted.” Watch the clip below:  Get The Brief.

2111,"No need to rush. Jennifer Lopez is not in a hurry to walk down the aisle with Alex Rodriguez, but she does want to spend the rest of her life with someone.  “I do believe in marriage,” the Shades of Blue actress, 48, told Harper’s Bazaar in a story published on Thursday, March 15. “And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I’m not forcing anything right now.”  As far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: “It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other’s lives in a way that most other people couldn’t.”  She added: “We both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.”  The pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single “Us” written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. “We’ve been together for one year today. I don’t want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song’s for you. I love you,” she told the athlete while on stage.  When talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: “They played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, ‘Oh, this is relevant!’ Alex and I were just getting to know each other. And I was like, ‘Oh, my God, could this be? Could this be us?’”  Lopez was previously married to chef Ojani Noa for nearly a year in 1997, and dancer Cris Judd from 2001 to 2002. She later married singer Marc Anthony in 2004 and they called it quits in 2011. The pair share 10-year-old twins Max and Emme. The former Yankees shortstop shares daughters Ella, 9, and Natasha, 13, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis. They split in 2008 after six years of marriage.  A lot has changed in the “Dance Again” songstress’ life since her last relationship, and she said a lot of it has to do with really knowing herself. “When I was younger I spent a lot of time being half happy and half not happy,” she told the publication. “I know who I am and what I want. I also know my strengths and weaknesses. It took me a long time to get to a point where I could say something nice about myself. I’m glad I can do that now.”  Lopez remains optimistic as she continues with her career, raise her two children and make her relationship with Rodriguez work for the long run. “Baseball is just like life,” she said. “All you want to do is hit a home run.”",fake

If you spent last weekend binge-watching Stranger Things 2 instead of going to Halloween parties, you’re not alone. Buzz around the second installment of Netflix’s nostalgic sci-fi hit has been building steadily since last summer, leading some to question whether season 2 could possibly live up to the hype. But judging by the new episodes’ critical acclaim and record-breaking social media impact, it seems the Duffer brothers have done it again — and that includes the costumes.  “We definitely felt the pressure to make sure whatever we did was up to par,” says costume designer Kim Wilcox, who was tasked with taking over the sartorial world built by Kimberly Adams-Galligan and Malgosia Turzanska in season 1. Her first order of business? Brightening up the show’s wardrobe a bit.  “I wanted to infuse more of the colors of the early ’80s,” she says, “so while we kept a lot of that earthy palette — the tans and browns and blues — we also added in some pastels and slightly poppier colors. The tones are a little happier-looking.”  Even though the events of Stranger Things 2 are, for the most part, anything but happy. Below, Wilcox discusses Eleven’s Madonna-inspired punk makeover, Max’s California skater-girl style, the joys of dressing Bob, and much more.  What was your biggest costume challenge heading into Stranger Things 2?  Figuring out what Eleven would wear after the pink dress was something that the Duffers and I spent a lot of time thinking about. It’s such an iconic look that Kimberly created, and you see it in flashbacks throughout season 2.  When we first find her in Hopper’s (David Harbour) cabin, she’s watching television — [both] to learn the language and to learn about culture outside of the lab. She hasn’t been a normal child at all; her exposure to the world is through commercials and soaps. So at first, we were like, “Is she into the classic ’80s girly-girl looks? Would she wear something that felt really feminine?” But when we tried it on, it just felt forced.  [So I started thinking,] how would she have gotten her clothes? In my head, Hopper had been giving her clothes he already had in boxes in his cabin, and then maybe making a run to the next county to go to a thrift store and buy stuff for a boy, as a disguise. When we put all that together, it just made more sense to us. So that’s why Eleven looks the way she does for much of the season; nothing really fits well.  In episode 7, “The Lost Sister,” she gets a major makeover, though. How did you settle on the look for “punk Eleven?”  Well, she’s found this new group of people, and for the first time she can be open about her powers. We wanted her to become part of the gang, to absorb part of that look, to be this rougher person. So half of her costume is still made up of things she would’ve brought with her — her famous Converse, her socks, her jeans — but we felt that the top half would’ve been borrowed from the others, and that it’d be fun to combine a torn T-shirt with a tweedier element.  I was looking back to pictures of punks in the late ’70s and early ’80s, of photos of Siouxsie Sioux and Madonna in blazers with rolled-up sleeves. Madonna actually stole a lot of her looks from punk and made them her own; I remember going to thrift stores and buying 1960s blazers, rolling the sleeves and popping the collars. You’d put a bandana in your hair, and all of a sudden, you were Madonna!  I was thinking that the jacket might’ve been something they’d found in a warehouse, or stolen from somebody, and then gave to Eleven. The shoulders on the jacket give Millie a much bigger silhouette, too, and for this moment where she’s becoming a more powerful person, it felt appropriate that you’d see that in her silhouette. And wearing a bandana tied around your arm or your ankle as a badge was very popular at that time.  Is that blazer a vintage piece?  We knew we might need multiples, so we couldn’t use vintage. That’s the thing about working with vintage: You can find the perfect piece, but on a series like this where there’s a lot of action — and people are growing! — it gets really tricky. It’s very, very hard to find multiples of vintage clothing.  Nancy Wheeler’s amazing sweaters have to be vintage though, right? If not, I must know where to get them!  Unfortunately, those are mostly vintage one-offs that we were lucky enough to either rent or buy. But we actually created the green turtleneck she wears for a large portion of season 2 based off of a vintage piece. We were very lucky to find a similar fabric, because we needed about six multiples of that sweater. We made a lot of her clothes for this season.  It was nice to take Nancy from skirts to jeans. In season 1, she was very prim and proper; now, she’s trying to keep up this façade, and it’s just not working for her! The Duffers and I said that she’d probably try to keep up her old look until the party scene — that’s when she kind of loses it, when her relationship with Steve starts to unravel.  Speaking of the Halloween party episode, what was it like designing costumes for all those guests?  There were about 100 people at that high school party, so it was a feat! Plus we had to do costumes for all the younger trick-or-treaters, too. But it was so much fun to look back at the movies and music from that time and say, okay, we need to make a Madonna, we need to make a Terminator... I think there’s a Michael Jackson somewhere in that crowd, too! My crew was really delighted to be able to get crafty and have a little fun.  Let’s switch gears and talk about Billy (Dacre Montgomery), because his look is incredible. What — or, rather, who — inspired it?  With Billy, I wanted to hark back to classic Americana. He’s into hot rods, he drives a Camaro, he’s dangerous — so how do you show that [through clothing]? I was thinking about Rebel Without a Cause, Johnny Depp in the ’80s, and Rob Lowe, who was a huge heartthrob at the time.  That denim-on-denim look can be so sexy; these days, if you don’t do it right, it looks a little silly, but if it’s weathered and fits you perfectly, it can be wonderfully masculine. And the earring is something that Dacre was really adamant about; the idea for that came from this old photo of Rob Lowe that our hair designer had found and was using as inspiration for his mullet. I just love the moment when the Camaro first pulls out, his boot comes out of the car and hits the ground, and all the girls are staring. It’s so ’80s!  His jeans must’ve been tailored to within an inch of their life...  Actually, they weren’t tailored at all! They’re vintage Levi’s from 1979, very difficult to find. We actually only had one pair for most of the season, and we were terrified they were going to rip. Because, you know, Billy gets into some stuff! But towards the end of the season, I got so lucky: I was looking on eBay and Etsy — we get a lot of our clothes online — and I found one more pair! They came, and they fit like a glove. I couldn’t believe it.  How about Billy’s skateboarding stepsister, Max (Sadie Sink)? I loved her colorful track jackets.  With Max, I was thinking about what it was like to shop for clothes as a young woman in the early ’80s. Colors weren’t really divided by gender as much [back then]; it wasn’t this world of pink we’re living in now. I wanted Max to be someone who is an outsider, who’s her own person, who chooses her own clothes and goes for what she likes. She doesn’t fit into a nice little box.  I actually grew up in a beach town myself, and the surfers and skateboarders I knew were really into Hang Ten and Ocean Pacific (Op). So we were riffing off of those brands; the windsurfer sweatshirt we created for her is actually inspired by an Op one we found on Etsy. It’s nice to have someone who can give the boys a run for their money. She’s so much cooler than they are!  Who was your absolute favorite character to dress this season?  I have to say, working with Sean Astin was just a dream. And Bob is our Barb this season! He works at RadioShack and is just this simple, very smart guy, and a wonderful partner for our hero, Joyce.  I pulled up all these old photos of actual RadioShack employees [as inspiration]. They didn’t really wear uniforms, usually just a suit or a sport coat and slacks. And a lot of polyester! So that boring brown-on-tan [look] — we were just like, “this is it.” His jeans are so ’70s, too. Bob definitely hasn’t changed his style in a very long time. [Laughs]  Bob went all out with his Halloween costume, too; you get the feeling that he probably did that kind of thing every year. And [Sean] loved his vampire makeup and teeth. It was really fun to play with the campiness of that, not to mention working with someone who was in The Goonies. I mean, it’s the dream!  Stranger Things is a huge hit in the fashion world: Topshop has a collection dedicated to the show, Louis Vuitton made a Stranger Things T-shirt, and Millie Bobby Brown is a muse for Calvin Klein. What’s it like seeing that sort of response?  It’s wild! And sort of funny, too, because the clothes are very true to what people actually wore at the time. It’s stuff that fashion wouldn’t have considered fashion back then!  The fan base is just so vast; people have really latched on to these characters and their wonderfully human, emotional relationships. Because they’re real! You can remember yourself having friends like this and having those moments where you just needed someone to sit down and talk you through a problem, like Mike (Finn Wolfhard) does with Will.  I also think that something about the ’80s is especially appealing right now, because life is really difficult for a lot of people. Our country is at odds. But in the world of Stranger Things, things seem a little bit simpler. There’s hope, even though the characters are going through a dark time. That’s the thing about Stranger Things: It reminds you of how fun ’80s movies were, but it’s also there to hold your hand.  All episodes of Stranger Things 2 are now streaming on Netflix.",real

2131,"The eight-hour diet is the latest health craze to hit Hollywood and fitness gurus are raving about its benefits.  The programme is based on only eating within a window of eight hours per day, and fasting for the other 16 to kick the body into fat burning mode.  Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are said to be fans of the diet, eating breakfast at 10am and having their last meal of the day before 6pm.  Australian nutritionist, Lee Holmes, spoke to FEMAIL about the benefits of the eight-hour diet and discusses whether or not it really works.  Advertisement  ""The idea of intermittent fasting may seem foreign, impossible and even scary to some but, I've got a secret for you! It's something you do every. Single. Day,"" Lee said.  Over the past few months, fitness gurus and nutrition professionals have been raving about the benefits of the eight hour diet. Photo / Getty Images  ""As soon as you drift off to sleep at night until the moment you open your eyes in the morning, you've been doing intermittent fasting. They don't call it break-fast for nothing because essentially you're breaking the fast when you eat your first meal in the morning.""  Lee said the easiest way to begin fasting is to increase the time after your last meal in the evening and your breakfast in the morning.  ""By practicing fasting, you allow your body and gut time to digest, rest and heal. Fasting lightens the load on the gut, allowing it to work at its optimum. It also improves the cleansing process,"" Lee said.  ""New research is beginning to demonstrate that intermittent fasting can increase the speed of cell recycling and regeneration, which reduces inflammation in the body. This means we can get sick less, experience less pain and become less susceptible to diseases.""  Fasting can also help kick-start weight loss and repair the body, while reducing blood pressure and increasing energy.  ""But don't be fooled! Just because you're fasting, it doesn't mean you'll go hungry! If you eat satiating, delicious whole foods, you won't be hungry throughout the day - think good fats and protein sources instead of low-calorie junk food,"" Lee said.  Acknowledging that the diet may not be for everyone, as it can be tough to stick too, she also added that those who have suffered from an eating disorder in the past should not try it.",fake

In May 2014, McPhee filed for divorce from Cokas after six years of marriage. The 34-year-old “American Idol” alum confirmed her engagement to Foster, 68, on Tuesday.  “He did it at the top of this mountain in Anacapri [Italy]. Totally dark only stars,” she revealed in a text exchange (via Instagram) with Just Jared’s Jared Eng, before joking: “Thankfully he didn’t push me off the cliff. He said it was one or the other. And in the end he spared me.”  Following news of the engagement, Foster’s daughters took to social media, where Erin, 35, jokingly called her future stepmom “Mommyyyy.” Sara, 37, also wrote, “Out of the country. What did I miss?”  This isn’t the first time Erin and Sara have played around with Foster and McPhee’s relationship status. In September, Sara posted, “Excited about my new step mom” on her Instagram story.  The siblings also believed Foster would find wife No. 5 long before he popped the question to McPhee.  “We love when he is married, in a relationship. He is at his happiest when he is in a relationship,” Erin said in 2016. “He will definitely get married again. He loves being married. Lucky No. 5!”  Foster split from first wife B.J. Cook in 1981 after nine years. He wed Rebecca Dyer the following year, later calling it quits with her in 1986. Following his 14-year union to Linda Thompson, which ended in 2005, Foster married Yolanda Hadid in 2011. Their divorce was finalised in 2017.  McPhee just confirmed her relationship with Foster at the Met Gala in May. They’ve been romantically linked for a little over a year.

Hours after Aniston and Theroux announced their decision to part ways, Twitter was flooded with speculation about her next romantic move. Fans were quick to point out that the 49-year-old actress and Pitt are both single for the first time in years. Many shared hopes that the ex’s would find their way back to one another.  ‘Somewhere, Jennifer Aniston is crafting her “Hey, let’s grab coffee and catch up” text to Brad Pitt,’ tweeter Madeline Hill wrote.  While a number of fans were excited at the prospect of Aniston and Pitt reigniting their old flame, some fans were grieving the end of her seemingly-perfect marriage to Theroux, 46. Others felt it was simply time to let any lingering Aniston-Pitt nostalgia go.  ‘Please do not subject us to stories that Jennifer Aniston is getting back together with Brad Pitt. Everyone deserves a break while dealing with the end of a marriage,’ Twitter user Kristyn Burtt wrote.  Rumors are swirling about Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt potentially rekindling their romance  Some Twitter users were flat out opposed to the thought of a reunion, noting that Aniston has done well for herself since leaving Pitt in the past. The Allied actor, however, has been battling some demons.  ‘Y’all really think Jennifer Aniston about to go sniffing around Brad Pitt when he got 10 kids and an alcohol addiction? Meanwhile she has a yoga body and a Smart Water deal w/ 0 kids in sight. She good,’ a Twitter user under the pseudonym C.Rush shared.  So is Jennifer Aniston getting back together with Brad Pitt?  Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux split  Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their divorce on Thursday. In a statement released to the Associated Press, they revealed that they had ‘lovingly’ made the decision at the end of 2017 after nearly three years of marriage and roughly seven years as a couple. Although Aniston and Theroux are no longer together, the pair said in their joint statement that they intend to continue to foster their ‘cherished friendship’.  ‘In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation,’ the statement read. ‘This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.’  Me: *reading about Jennifer Aniston & Justin Theroux split* awww that sucks  Also me: planning Jennifer Aniston & Brad Pitt's second wedding — Ally Reid (@ashallann) February 16, 2018  The notoriously private pair went on to say that they only decided to go public about their split to stop any speculation before it could start. Aniston and Theroux added that they wanted to be sure fans got ‘the truth directly’, rather than reading and believing gossip.  ��...❤️✌️ A post shared by @ justintheroux on Aug 5, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT  ‘Normally we would do this privately, but given the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we want to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.’  Although they parted ways at the end of 2017, Aniston and Theroux jetted together to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico with Jason Bateman, his family and other close friends.

They tied the knot nearly four years later in a surprise ceremony at their home in August 2015. Guests believed they were there to attend a birthday celebration for Theroux.  History of Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt’s relationship  Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt reportedly began dating after meeting on a blind date their respective agents set up in 1998. They quickly became the ‘it’ couple of the early 2000s, with their every move making headlines. Two years after they met, Aniston and Pitt, 54, married.

The couple announced that they had ‘formally’ separated. After their divorce announcement, fans couldn’t help but wonder what went wrong.  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie got together shortly after his divorce from Jennifer Aniston, which raised eyebrows among fans of the actress known first and foremost for her role as Rachel Green in Friends. It wasn’t until years into their relationship that Jolie, 42, admitted that she and Pitt had fallen in love on the set of Mr & Mrs Smith, which they began filming in 2003.  ‘Because of the film, we ended up being brought together to do all these crazy things, and I think we found this strange friendship and partnership that kind of just suddenly happened. I think a few months in I realized, “God, I can’t wait to get to work.”…Anything we had to do with each other, we just found a lot of joy in it together and a lot of real teamwork. We just became kind of a pair,’ she revealed in an issue of Vogue.  In case you all forgot: Brad Pitt fell in love with another woman and begun a relationship with her while he was still married to Jennifer Aniston. He left her to be with someone else. Why would anyone want her to get back together with him? — Alina (@__LinaGarcia) February 16, 2018  Not many believed them, but the pair always insisted they waited to get romantic, with Jolie telling the fashion magazine they were merely ‘very, very good friends’ until after Pitt and Aniston ended their marriage.  ‘It took until, really, the end of the shoot for us, I think to realize that it might mean something more than we’d earlier allowed ourselves to believe. And both knowing that the reality of that was a big thing, something that was going to take a lot of serious consideration,’ she said.  In 2005, Pitt joined Jolie on a trip to Ethiopia to adopt her second child. He formally adopted the little girl, Zahara, and her older brother Maddox, in 2006. That same year he and Jolie welcomed their first biological child together, a daughter named Shiloh.  Jolie adopted son Pax in 2007, with Pitt adopting the child as his own in 2008. That year the couple welcomed two more biological children, twins Knox and Vivienne. They married at the urging of their children in 2014.

At the time, Jolie and Pitt had been engaged for close to two years.  The pair previously said that they would not marry until it was legal for all people to be married.  ‘We both have been married before, so it’s not marriage that’s necessarily kept some people together,’ Jolie told Vogue. ‘We are legally bound to our children, not to each other, and I think that’s the most important thing.’  After 11 years together, Jolie and Pitt shocked fans by announcing their divorce. Jolie’s attorney, Robert Offer, told AP that her decision to end the marriage was ‘for the health of the family’.  Pitt fired back in a statement of his own, which he released to People magazine, in which he claimed he was ‘saddened’ by the whole ordeal. He went on to say that his focus, at the time, was on his children.  Not long after they went public about their divorce, reports surfaced suggesting that Pitt was being investigated for child abuse linked to an incident on a private plane. People reported that the Los Angeles Police Department and the L.A. County Department of Children and Family Services was looking into an anonymous report that Pitt had been ‘verbally abusive’ and gotten ‘physical’ with one of his children, which later was revealed to be Maddox.  The incident in question reportedly occurred on September 14. Pitt is said to have been drinking at the time. His entire family was present during the alleged altercation.

People later amended their report to say that DCFS was the only agency investigating Pitt. TMZ later released an article stating that the FBI was also investigating the incident.  The FBI responded to a request for comment from Us Weekly, stating that they were still determining what action, if any, should be taken.  ‘In response to your inquiry regarding allegations within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States; specifically, an aircraft carrying Mr Brad Pitt and his children, the FBI is continuing to gather facts and will evaluate whether an investigation at the federal level will be pursued,’ the statement read.  In the end, Pitt was not prosecuted in the incident. He and Jolie reached a custody agreement, and he was eventually able to have his first visit with his children.  No word from Pitt nor Aniston about whether reconciliation is on the horizon, though it has not stopped rampant speculation, with one report even saying they were planning on making their debut as a couple at this year's Oscars.",fake

1551,"Getty  It couldn’t come at a worse time for Jennifer, who is determined to re-establish her position in the industry after a series of flops.  She’s just started filming the new Netflix movie Murder Mystery set in Montreal, alongside Adam Sandler, and until now hoped the prestigious comedy whoddunit would propel her back into the Hollywood A-list.  But in an unfortunate twist of fate, her new boss Ted Sarandos is also a very close friend of Angelina’s.  The United Nations ambassador made her relationships with both Ted and Adam clear back in January when the trio were photographed at the Critics’ Choice Awards looking very happy and close.  ‘Jennifer’s heard they’re all still really chummy and it’s making her paranoid,’ adds the source.  Compared to her sitcom heyday, Jennifer’s career has been shaky over the past few years. Her last big release Mother’s Day – in 2016 – was a critical flop, while The Yellow Birds, made by her production company Echo Films, received a lukewarm reception on its release last year.  Although much was made of Jennifer buying the film rights to hit Aussie author Liane Moriarty’s What Alice Forgot in 2015, the project hasn’t got much further in development, while Dumplin’, a musical comedy also made by Echo, was filmed last year but still doesn’t have a specific release date or any overseas distribution deals.  Related: Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston's second wedding joy  Related: Brad Pitt tells: ‘Jen’s a great mum to my kids’  Meanwhile, reports say Jen and Reese Witherspoon’s much hyped Apple TV series about morning television – in which they both star and co-produce – is already in trouble.  ‘Jennifer is worried that her days are numbered and that her career is really drying up – she turns 50 next birthday and she’s had box-office flop after box-office flop. She is doing everything she can to make a Friends reunion happen because she knows that will skyrocket her back on speed dial with all the Hollywood bosses and revive her career – but it just doesn’t look like that’s happening any time soon,’ explains the insider.  Whether or not Jennifer’s chance of making a go of things at Netflix is under threat, the embattled star is feeling the heat.  ‘Jen is worried she’s running out of options.

4376,"If you were anywhere near an Internet-enabled device yesterday, then you no doubt heard the news:  After nine years behind bars on armed robbery charges, former NFL star O.J. Simpson has been paroled.  Yes, it looks like the football great and likely double-murderer might be a free man as early as October 1.  The 70-year-old Simpson, of course, is one of the most notorious public figures in America.  As a result, it stands to reason that the question of what he'll do after his release is looming large today.  Will he write another ill-advised memoir, or did he learn his lesson the first time?  Will he attempt to re-enter public life, or simply lay low?  And, of course, will the Juice make an appearance on Maury to settle the most famous paternity mystery since Jon Snow?  As you may have heard, a rumor that O.J. is Khloe Kardashian's father has been circulating on the Internet for years and years.  Proponents cite several pieces of ""evidence,"" including the fact that Kris Jenner and Simpson ran in the same social circles.  (The physical dissimilarities between Khloe and her sisters is perhaps the biggest driver of this long-running theory.)  One thing that is fact, father than fiction, is that at the time of his arrest for double murder, Simpson was tight with the family.  O.J. was so close with the Kardashians that they were prominently featured in the FX miniseries about the Simpson trial.  So some considered it strange that the 33-year-old Khloe didn't comment on the news of Simpson's impending release.  And the Internet being the Internet, a handful of folks flocked to Khloe's Instagram page to try and coax a comment out of her.  Khloe posted the above pic to her Instagram page yesterday, and not surprisingly, many of the comments had little to do with the photo.  O.J. was the news of the day, and the reactions to Khloe's photo reflected that ... sometimes amusingly, other times inappropriately.  “Dad’s on his way home from that vacation your mom told you about when you were a kid,"" joked one fan.  “The face you make when you find out Daddy’s home #oj,"" commented another.  “Your dad is out of prison girl, u must be thrilled,"" wrote a third.  Eventually, Khloe broke Internet Rule Number One and fed the trolls, but she did so without debasing herself by engaging in one-on-one arguments.  “People are a--oles but I don’t care lol. I focus on the good,” Khloe wrote. “They are all f-cked lol such a--holes.""  ""Hehe oh well… I’m happy and they hatin’.""  Jokes are one thing, but mean-spirited comments made directly to Khloe without an iota of wit are uncalled for.  And, as many fans pointed out, in some cases, they're disrespectful to the late Robert Kardashian Sr. (with O.J., above).  The elder Robert Kardashian died in 2003 at the age of 59; Kris Jenner and Kardashian married in 1978 but later divorced.  Fortunately, Khloe's been in the spotlight for the better part of two decades, so she knows exactly how to handle this sort of thing by now.",fake
1157,"On March 17, first lady Melania Trump, clad in a belted custom Alice Roi coatdress, Gianvito Rossi stilettos and Gucci sunglasses, strode across the White House lawn with her husband, Donald. With the press corps photographers snapping away, the 46-year-old Slovenia-born stunner smiled for the cameras as the billionaire, 70, awkwardly reached for her hand and clutched the tips of her fingers.  Once the obligatory photo op was complete, she, Donald and their 11-year-old son, Barron, boarded Marine One, POTUS’ helicopter, which whisked them away to their Palm Beach, Florida, estate, Mar-a-Lago. Aboard the chopper — and away from the public eye — Melania dropped the act. And Donald’s hand. “Melania,” a family source alleges in the new issue of Us Weekly, “does not keep hidden from everyone around her how miserable she is.”  That includes the presi­dent himself. Multiple sources claim that the former fashion model — who’s currently living 200 miles away from Washington, D.C., in NYC’s Trump Tower while Barron finishes the school year — refuses to share a bed with Donald even on the rare occasions when they sleep in the same city. “They have separate bedrooms,” says another Trump insider. “They never spend the night together — ever.” (A third source says the couple do sleep in the same room but keep separate beds: “It’s very ‘royal’ of them!”)  Upset with the former reality star for trapping her in a life she despises, “Melania wants as little to do with Donald as possible,” explains the family source. “She is not interested in Donald, the presidency or anything involving him.” A rep for Melania denies the claims, telling Us, “It’s unfortunate that you are going to feature unnamed ‘sources’ that have provided fictional accounts.”  Since assuming the role of first lady January 20, Melania has kept an extremely limited official schedule. After the inauguration, she mostly stayed in her gilded Fifth Avenue triplex penthouse and didn’t set foot in the nation’s capital again for 21 days. And the few official appearances she has made were done so begrudgingly.  Melania escorted Akie Abe, the Japanese prime minister’s wife, around Palm Beach in February, but “only because she was going to be at Mar-a-Lago already,” according to the family source. “She refused to do it in Washington.”  For much more on the Trumps, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!",fake

On Monday, Kelly Ripa and ABC has finally decided to make Ryan her permanent co-host and it seems like the ripple effect of this decision has reached the backyard of the Kardashians clan whose life is being featured on E! thanks to the former American Idol host.  In fact, a source revealed to Radar Online that the Keeping Up With the Kardashians momager Kris Jenner is “terrified” for their future as KUWTK producer Ryan Seacrest makes the big move.  “Of course Kris is scared,” the insider who was reportedly close to the family declared.  According to the outlet, Seacrest was the one who was “almost single-handedly responsible for giving Jenner a spot on E! for KUWTK” which is why his decision to leave Los Angeles for New York seems to be something that may also affect the reality TV show.  The outlet further explained Kris’ fears, saying that the timing of Ryan’s move could “not be worse for the money-hungry momager” as less people tune in to watch the Kardashians go about their personal lives while on camera in Keeping Up With the Kardashians. In fact, KUWTK producer Ryan Seacrest leaving L.A. might also be a sign that the reality show will soon be facing the end, according to Radar‘s source.  “More and more viewers are tuning out every week and at this point it looks like the end is inevitable.”  Still, there seems to be no confirmation yet as to whether or not Seacrest will no longer be producing E!’s Keeping Up With the Kardashians. Although he may be moving to the Big Apple, the 42-year-old TV host revealed that he will still spend a lot of time in L.A. in an interview with Variety after he was named as the co-host for Live!  “I have never lived here before but I have spent a lot of time here,” he told the outlet when asked whether or not he ever tried living in New York.  “I expect to still spend a lot of time in Los Angeles, but I’m excited to take up residence in the Big Apple.”  According to the New York Times, KUWTK producer Ryan Seacrest was granted a position in “a high-profile platform” by making him Kelly Ripa’s co-host for ABC’s morning show in preparation for a new competition.  “It’s making sure the show is in the right hands — one day, eventually, I’m sure of it, I will retire,” Ripa told the outlet, adding a forecast about her new permanent co-host’s future.  “And Ryan Seacrest, who is a seamless broadcaster and a kind human being, is the one who can take this show into the future.”  Of course, it is still too early to know for sure whether or not KUWTK producer Ryan Seacrest will be letting go of his project with Kris Jenner and E! especially since he was recently named as one of the co-producers for a Keeping Up With the Kardashians spinoff covering Kylie Jenner’s private life.  According to another report from Variety, the host’s entertainment production company Ryan Seacrest Productions is teaming up with Bunim/Murray Productions to make Life of Kylie happen.

When news broke that Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew were being let go from Grey’s Anatomy, fans were rightly upset. Luckily for those diehard Arizona Robbins fans, ShondaLand has revealed that the character will be getting her very own spinoff!  Like Private Practice, the new series (which is still untitled) will follow Arizona as she sets off on a new adventure. This time, Arizona will be moving to New York to be closer to her daughter who had moved there with Callie.  As seen on Grey’s Anatomy, Sofia was having a hard time returning to Seattle to visit Arizona. It clearly made things harder for both mother and daughter. This will lead to Arizona deciding to move to New York.  It’s not yet clear if this means that Arizona will also try to rekindle things with her ex-wife, given that Sara Ramirez has seemingly moved on from her character of Callie. But fans can always hope!  Either way, we’re excited to hear that Jessica Capshaw won’t be leaving the Grey’s Anatomy universe after all!  Meanwhile, Scandal may air its final episode on April 19, but the Gladiators aren’t going anywhere!  Expected to release in the fall of 2018, the Scandal spinoff, Gladiator Wanted will return as a web-only series. Airing new episodes each Thursday (is there really any other day), the series will pick up the pieces following the series finale.  Back in 2016, the series produced a limited digital-only spinoff starring some of the original cast. With the focus on elections, Olivia Pope’s family, and other more pressing matters in the West Wing, it’s easy for Scandal to forget about the little guys. Namely those who make the series what it is – the Gladiators.  While casting is under wraps (can’t spoil who will or will not survive the current season), we expect that some familiar voices and faces may appear in front of and behind the camera. Could Darby Stanchfield, who directed all six episodes of Gladiator Wanted return? Recently she made her Scandal directorial debut with season 7’s “The Noise.”  Who else will stop by for another bite of Scandal? Should they survive, our money is on Huck (Guillermo Diaz), Charlie (George Newbern), and Quinn (Katie Lowes). Seeing as they were involved in the first spinoff, and are the heart of the current QPA operation, it makes sense that they would swing by for a guest spot or two!  The only original cast member we’re speculating will not return is Marcus, played by Cornelius Smith Jr. He made a nice pitch for his character to eventually head over to HTGAWM during the crossover event.  Are you excited the Gladiators are not hanging up their white hats just yet?  April Fools!",real

10553,"Kate Middleton, 36, has given birth to three children since marrying Prince William, 36, and becoming a member of the Royal Family. Being a normal girl from Berkshire, the former fashion and marketing professional had to adapt to royal life. When she did fall pregnant, Kate was not allowed to have one baby tradition other mothers in the UK will experience, a baby shower. Another royal baby is now on the way, with Meghan Markle having her first child with husband Prince Harry. With Meghan now pregnant, and hailing from the US where baby showers are the norm, will Meghan be allowed what Kate wasn’t?  Kate Middleton: The pregnancy tradition Kate was not allowed to have - will Meghan be?  Baby showers are a way for the expectant mother and those close to her to celebrate the pregnancy and upcoming birth. This happens by showering the mother-to-be with gifts, a pregnancy tradition. However, baby showers are reported to be frowned on in the Royal Family and not celebrated, as they appear to be tasteless. Speaking to People magazine, royal expert Victoria Arbiter revealed that a royal baby shower could come with “added pressure that they are clearly very wealthy.” She stated: “A lavish baby shower would be seen as highly inappropriate... there's nothing they can't go out and buy themselves"". It is believed that Kate hasn’t had a baby shower for any of her three children.  Kate has been pregnant three times, and is believed to have never had a baby shower  Back in 2013 when she was pregnant with Prince George, rumours circulated that her sister Pippa had thrown her a shower. However, these rumours were shot down by many royal experts, as the point of a shower is to receive gifts and that is something the Royal Family wouldn’t do. According to Victoria, royal protocol exists around gift giving and any gifts given to expectant royal parents must be “respectfully returned”. This means it is highly unlikely that Meghan will be having a baby shower to celebrate the upcoming birth of her first child, despite it being a US tradition. While on their royal tour of Australia, Tonga and Fiji, Meghan and Harry did receive some gifts, including a stuffed toy kangaroo and a pair of tiny Ugg boots.  Pippa was rumoured to have thrown pregnant Kate a shower, but the rumours were shot down  Meghan is now expecting her first child, and baby showers are a US tradition  It is not known as to whether or not the Sussexes had to return the kangaroo and other gifts, but they were delighted at the gifts when presented with them in Sydney. While Kate wasn’t allowed a baby shower due to her royal title, her sister Pippa might well have had one. Pippa gave birth to a baby boy last week, and following the birth a statement was released by Kensington Palace on behalf of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The statement read: “The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are thrilled for Pippa and James.” It was believed that Kate didn’t visit Pippa in the hospital, as it would've caused too much of a media circus.",real

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Will and Tyrese for comment.  In his initial comment, The Fast And The Furious star said: ' When we show UP for each-other there’s nothing that can’t be done I️ repeat nothing.  'My wife kept the news away from me cause I’ve been on with lawyers all day but our family and our sister Jada-Pinkett Smith and my brother Will Smith just sent us 5 million dollars to help keep us afloat.'

13052,"While there's no ""right"" way to get sweaty, there's no question that fitness trends can influence how people work out. And with the American College of Sports Medicine's annual survey, we're getting a look at what's going to be big this year. They've pinpointed the top fitness trends of 2018 to watch for, and chances are, if you haven't gotten in on any of them yet, you just might soon.  Published in the ACSM’s Health & Fitness Journal, more than 4,000 fitness professionals (including trainers, exercise physiologists, and fitness directors) gave their thoughts on the trends they think will be big in 2018. The survey respondents represented organizations including the American College of Sports Medicine, American Council on Exercise, National Council on Strength and Fitness, and The Cooper Institute. The responses were international, too, coming from 41 countries across the world and nearly every continent.  In the survey, the ACSM made an important distinction between a trend and a fad to the participants. While a trend was defined as “a general development or change in a situation or in the way that people are behaving,"" a fad was ""a fashion that is taken up with great enthusiasm for a brief period."" (Shout-out to '80s Jazzercise and '90s Tae Bo.) For the purposes of this survey, the ACSM was interested in trends, which have more staying power. Survey respondents were asked to rank 40 potential fitness trends on a 10-point scale, where 1 was least likely to be a trend in 2018, and 10 was most likely to be a trend in 2018.  Here are the top 10 fitness trends of 2018, according to the pros—and what you need to know about each one.  1. High-Intensity Interval Training  High-intensity interval training (or HIIT) took the top spot in this year's survey (it was also number one in 2014). A HIIT training session involves bursts of maximum-effort, very hard work (typically about 20 to 90 seconds), followed by a period of low-intensity recovery. The goal is to recover enough that you can go hard again during your next work interval. If you're a beginner, you might have longer rest intervals, or work intervals that are challenging but not at maximum effort.  The ACSM says HIIT workouts are typically 30 minutes or less, although they can be longer. But while they may be short, they definitely aren't sweet. As the name suggests, HIIT workouts are designed to be high intensity, and a major part of the appeal is that they're an incredibly efficient and effective way to get your cardio in and burn lots of calories (if that's something that matters to you) without requiring a ton of time.  That said, because they're so intense, you shouldn't be doing HIIT workouts every day. This can lead to overtraining and an increased risk of injury (which survey respondents expressed concerns about, according to the ACSM). Read more about how to correctly do HIIT workouts here.  2. Group Training  Group training (or group fitness classes) didn't make the top 20 trends until 2017, but their popularity is rapidly rising. The ACSM defines group training as a workout for five or more people led by an instructor, designed to be motivational and effective for people of different fitness levels. This could be anything from trendy HIIT classes like OrangeTheory Fitness, to dance cardio classes, to old-school step classes at the YMCA.  No matter here are plenty of benefits of group fitness classes. They can be a great way to try a new workout or mix up your routine (many boutique fitness studios offer free or discounted first classes, as a bonus). There's also a social aspect—classes can be a fun way to sweat it out with friends or meet new people. Plus, when you sign up for a class, you're committing to your workout, which can help you stay on track with your routine.  3. Wearable Technology  Activity trackers, smart watches, and heart rate monitors are as popular as ever—if you're into seeing your workouts by the numbers, wearable technology can give you interesting feedback about how you move. Many estimate your steps, sleep, standing time, calories burned, and time spent working out.",real

Their source claims that Tess called off the relationship because she “realized she still had feelings for her ex after splitting from him to date Harry and has apologized to him for her romance with the singer.” Just one month into her romance with the One Direction front-man, she allegedly ran back into her exes arms. “It will take a while for Tess to build back his trust but they have been getting on as normal. She was in London this week and met her ex straight away — they’ve been inseparable since.” Poor Harry! See pics of the blonde food blogger, here.  Though Harry is also currently in England, the source insisted that “Harry and Tess haven’t seen each other for a number of weeks. They’re both constantly travelling the world.” That’s certainly enough to put a nail in the coffin of a relationship. There were warning signs of a rift. In May, Tess admitted in an interview that she was struggling with all of the hate she was getting from 1D fans. “I want a break! I just want a break. It’s been so weird, the hate messages.

The actress, 28, earned her first Oscar nomination in 2017 for her performance as Tonya Harding in I, Tonya. She’s back in contention this year for embodying Queen Elizabeth I opposite Saoirse Ronan as Mary Stuart in the drama, from House of Cards writer Beau Willimon.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  In a scene from director Josie Rourke’s film, exclusive to PEOPLE, Robbie stars as a young Elizabeth, urging her suitor for many years, Robert Dudley (Joe Alwyn), to pursue Mary, who has returned to Scotland to claim her throne.  “Do not ask this of me,” Dudley pleads with Elizabeth.  “If you wed her, she is ours,” Elizabeth says. “Marry the beautiful queen of Scots and we can control her. With Mary, you too can become prince.”  Image zoom Margot Robbie in Mary Queen of Scots Focus Features  Robbie shared recently with Harper’s Bazaar that her costars were often intimidated when she was in costume as Elizabeth I —especially when she played the Queen in the years after she was affected by a horrible and scarring bout of small pox.  “I’d say, ‘Hey, how’s your weekend?’ But they wouldn’t even get close to me,” Robbie, 28, recalls of trying to chat with people while covered with scars and thick white makeup. “It was very alienating. And I felt very lonely. It was an interesting social experiment.”  Robbie says had to wear layers of prosthetics and makeup to transform into Elizabeth, who often sported the heavy white makeup to cover the scars on her face for the small pox.

The film deals entirely with their fraught communications.  “Everyone manipulated their relationship,” Robbie told EW of Mary and Elizabeth. “It’s complicated, it’s tragic, and it’s bizarre. The only other person in the world who could understand the position they were in was each other.”",real
14902,"The pop star appeared at an event to toast her new campaign for the fashion brand on Wednesday night, as Kate Upton was posting about Marciano on Instagram.  Jennifer Lopez walked into the Guess headquarters in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday night looking radiant in a blue dress as she officially launched her new worldwide ad campaign with the iconic brand.  The timing for the artist, who was joined at the event by her boyfriend Alex Rodriguez, couldn't have been more awkward.  In an Instagram post just hours before, model Kate Upton had accused Guess creative director Paul Marciano of sexual and emotional harassment. During Wednesday's launch event, several representatives for the clothing brand were asked if there was an official statement regarding Upton's allegations on behalf of anyone for Guess or Marciano himself, but none was provided.  The party was attended by a starry crowd, from Paris Hilton to real estate developer Mohamed Hadid, whose daughter Gigi Hadid has been participating in Guess campaigns for years.  Asked about the #MeToo movement, Lopez said that she supports all women coming forward to tell their stories and called the moment ""a beautiful time for women."" ""We are really finding our voices,"" Lopez said. ""We are really coming out of the shadows and saying how we feel. [It's about] knowing our worth and our value and making the opposite sex aware of our worth and our value.""  She added that this is also the time for women all over to continue speaking up and being supported as a way to also empower young women. ""It's a groundbreaking thing that's going on in the world right now, so I'm super excited to be a part of this time. Of course, I always support women speaking up. I'm super excited about the time we are living in right now -- especially for my daughter.""  On Thursday, Lopez released this statement addressing the Marciano accusations: “My position on these issues is well known, as I have been very vocal about them. I do not condone any acts of sexual harassment, violation, or misconduct. Any accusations should be fully and thoroughly investigated. I will continue to support our rights as women.”  At the event, Marciano addressed his guests and spoke at length about asking Lopez to sign on to the campaign that will be seen around the world. It took him several months to finally reach Lopez in an attempt to ask her to consider becoming the face of Guess. ""[The campaign] will be seen in at least 45 countries,"" Marciano said, as his guests cheered him on. ""Jennifer trusted me. She trusted me with the pictures ... that I could do great pictures. The trust was there. It was destiny. It was not an accident. I want to make pictures that every single day you will go back to these pictures one day and show your children.""  According to Lopez's manager Benny Medina, who was also present at the Guess event, the star's next album is likely to be released in September.  A version of this story first appeared in Billboard.",real

2191,"Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux reportedly made a last-ditch effort to save their marriage during a vacation in Mexico with friends Jason Bateman and his wife.  The Hollywood stars announced on Thursday they were separating after two and a half years of marriage.  In a statement released by their publicists they said the decision to split 'was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year'.  Mexican get-away: Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are shown on January 1 during a vacation in Mexico that reportedly was a last-ditch effort to save their marriage  They were last photographed together on January 1 during a vacation in Cabo San Lucas with Jason, 49, and his 49-year-old wife Amanda Anka.  'Jason Bateman’s wife convinced Justin to go to Cabo. She has been the mediator in recent months, trying to get Jen and Justin to work through their problems and save their marriage,' a source told Us Weekly in an article on Thursday.  'The Cabo trip was a make or break vacation for Jen and Justin. They went away with their friends hoping to have fun and work on it,' the insider said of the post-Christmas vacation.  The salvage attempt, however, didn't pan out.

'Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly,' said the statement released by Jennifer's publicist Stephen Huvane.  'Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else's fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another,' the statement added.  Hollywood star: Jennifer is shown in a still from the 2011 comedy Horrible Bosses co-starring Jason  Deep respect: Justin and Jennifer, shown in January 2016 in Santa Monica, California, released a statement on Thursday about their split 'to reduce any further speculation'  Jennifer and Justin starred together in the 2012 comedy Wanderlust and got engaged in August 2012.

Jennifer was previously married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005.  She rose to fame on the TV sitcom Friends and her film credits include Office Christmas Party, Cake and Marley & Me.

According to a source Hudson, 35 – who got canned years ago as an American Idol hopeful — is making rehearsals a living hell for Clarkson, whose career was launched when she won the first season of Idol!  “Jennifer has had it out for her since Idol days and Kelly knows this,” the on-set snitch said.  “She is telling everyone who will listen that she may have lost Idol but she is not going to lose The Voice.”  As Radar previously reported, Hudson created a ton of drama when she was a coach on The Voice two seasons ago and was ripped apart by fans for her crazy on-camera antics, which included throwing shoes at contestants!  On the other hand, Clarkson gained a tremendous new fan base when she coached last season — and the execs love her too.  “Blake and Adam are already on Team Kelly and Jennifer knows this,” the source told Radar.  “Jennifer hasn’t changed at all and everyone knows that the only reason she was brought back is to bring the drama.

3874,"Dating women who resemble his ex, Kylie Jenner, is just a way for Tyga to pass the time. Here’s EXCLUSIVE scoop on why he won’t settle down with the look-alikes.  Since his split from Kylie Jenner in March 2017, Tyga has been spotted out and about with various different women who look like the reality star, but they’ll never hold a candle to the reality star in his mind. “Kylie fits the profile of Tyga’s ideal woman, physically — he loves brunettes with big lips, big brown eyes and a big butt,” an insider tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. “The thing with Kylie, though, is that it was about so much more than just what she looked like. Obviously, she was sexy and all, but Tyga had a really strong connection with her that went far deeper than the physical side of things.”  Tyga and Kylie broke up and got back together several times throughout their three-year relationship, but he probably didn’t realize that the 2017 split would mean it was really over for good. Just one month later, Kylie started dating Travis Scott, and on Feb. 1, she gave birth to his child. However, Tyga is convinced that there’s still hope for a reconciliation between himself and Kylie. “Tyga truly believes deep down in his heart that they’re not over,” our source adds. “He has faith that there’s no way it will last with Travis and that one day Kylie will come running back to him again. He’s just playing a waiting game for now.”  That’s not to say that he’s sitting around by himself during this waiting period, though. In fact, on the same day Kylie gave birth, Tyga was spotted leaving a nightclub with a brunette woman who definitely resembled his 20-year-old ex. He has to pass the time somehow…  HollywoodLifers, do you think Kylie would ever take Tyga back?",fake

18450,"For Gay Pride Month, Billboard asked numerous pop culture luminaries to write ""love letters"" to the LGBTQ community. Below, global superstar and outstanding LGBTQ ally Ariana Grande shares hers. Read more Pride Month love letters here.  There is nothing more infectious than the joy and love that the LGBTQ community exudes. I grew up with a gay brother whose every move I would emulate. I idolized him. Everything Frankie did, I would do. I can’t remember a difference between Frankie before he came out and Frankie after he came out. He’s always just been Frankie. Sexuality and gender were never topics my family and I were afraid to discuss. When Frankie came out my surprisingly unfazed (for his age) grandfather said “Congrats! Can we go to dinner now? I’m fuckin' hungry.”  I was taught to do my makeup by queens in gay bars in New York City. I made my Broadway debut at 14 years old and did 8 shows a week but there was never a night I was too tired to run to a gay bar and do a quick Whitney cover before bed.  My music being embraced and celebrated by the LGBTQ community is all I ever truly cared about when I thought about my career goals early on. There’s no award I could win or accolade I could receive that would fulfill me more than seeing a 6-foot queen with a 4-foot ponytail walk into my meet n greet and say “hey girl” or meeting a young queer person at Starbucks and them letting me know that my music has helped them become who they are. Literally nothing.  Love is like music. It knows no boundaries and isn’t exclusive to any one gender, sexuality, race, religion, age or creed. It’s a freedom and a delicious luxury that all people should be able to sink into and enjoy every moment of.  I am eternally indebted to and inspired by the LGBTQ community. I hope to create anthems for you that wrap you up with comfort and make you get your best life for as long as I live. Thank you for celebrating me the way I celebrate you.  I love you forever.",real

In the adorable photo, the family of four sits around a kitchen table dying eggs in all sorts of pastel colors for Easter. “Easter with #demkids,” she shared with her followers. “#moments #rocandroe #easter #family @nickcannon.”  Looks like the pop-megastar is trying to change the nickname of her growing twins to #demkids, who have been referred to by fans as #dembabies since their birth in 2012. The duo were married in April of 2008 but the “Honey” singer filed for divorce December of 2014.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BS-SZfWl8gS/  Carey and Cannon’s Easter celebration just a week after the “Glitter” actress announced she had split from backup dancer, Bryan Tanka after a year of dating. According to TMZ, Tanaka felt “disrespected” when Carey and Cannon, 36, attended the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards with their children on March 11. Tanaka would reportedly “lash back” at Carey and her friendship with Cannon by flirting with other women. Per TMZ, the pair have not seen or spoken to each other since they traveled to Cabo together at the end of March.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BS-SjBrF1Et/  The “Butterfly” singer also suffered heartbreak in October of 2016 after confirming her breakup with Australian billionaire, James Packer.

3487,"President Trump’s speech at the 2017 Boy Scout Jamboree has drawn criticism from former Boy Scouts and current Scout leaders alike, with some comparing the speech to a “political rally.”  During Monday night’s speech, Trump referred to “this horrible thing known as Obamacare,” called for “more loyalty” and recounted the night of his election as “that famous night on television.” Trump also repeated his claims against “fake media” and “fake news,” despite commencing the speech by saying “we’re going to put that aside.”  While the speech was interspersed with applause and chants of “USA! USA! USA!” from the audience, Trump’s comments about Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton also elicited boos from the crowd, which was highlighted by users on social media.  Former Chief Official White House Photographer Pete Souza made his own comparison between Obama and Trump via Instagram.  Current Scout leaders and former Scouts, as well as parents, also used Twitter to voice their criticism of the nature of Trump’s speech.  In a statement, the Boy Scouts of America said that it is “wholly non-partisan and does not promote any one position, product, service, political candidate or philosophy. The invitation for the sitting U.S. President to visit the National Jamboree is a long-standing tradition and is in no way an endorsement of any political party or specific policies.”  Get our Politics Newsletter.

8,"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Photo: Getty Images  Two years ago, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie dropped a bombshell: the Hollywood power couple was splitting up after two years of marriage but roughly 12 years together. What followed were months of back and forth between the (former) couple in the press. There were leaks about custody battles and Pitt’s reported drinking and weed smoking; meanwhile, Pitt gave a candid interview with GQ about the split and his new passion for sculpture and R&B music.  Last summer, there were a slew of new stories, court filings, and suspicious tabloid take-downs in this seemingly never-ending saga. But on Friday, a judge reportedly declared both Pitt and Jolie to be legally single – though their divorce settlement has not yet been finalized.  Here, a look at all that has happened with Brangelina’s divorce.  First, can we look back at their … uh … happier … days?  Sure. The coupling of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie is already Hollywood legend. The pair met while filming Mr. and Mrs. Smith in 2004 — back when Pitt was still married to Jennifer Aniston. Rumors about what may or may not have gone down between Pitt and Jolie on set ran rampant. Eventually, he and Aniston split up, and his relationship with Jolie (officially) came to light. But despite their, erm, salacious start, Pitt and Jolie proved to be the real deal. They were involved for 12 years, and had six kids and a French vineyard together.  So what went wrong?  Back in September 2016, we learned that an “incident” reportedly went down on a private plane, and that the Los Angeles Department of Child and Family Services and FBI got involved. That “incident,” which reportedly involved Pitt and son Maddox Jolie-Pitt, is said to be what prompted Jolie to file for divorce. But in an interview with Vanity Fair in 2017, Jolie made it pretty clear she didn’t want to talk on the record about what happened.  Ah, okay. But what’s happened since then?  Well, a lot. Just on the personal front, Pitt is said to have allegedly sobered up in rehab following the divorce announcement. He also was either involved or just friends with MIT professor Neri Oxman for a while (their exact relationship has always been unclear, despite making countless headlines). Jolie, meanwhile, has kept up with her humanitarian work for the United Nations. But divorce-wise, the Pitt and Jolie hadn’t been able to agree on custody or child-support arrangements — which means they’re still technically married.  Awkward. So, what went down last summer?  As I said, Jolie and Pitt just couldn’t seem to come to an understanding over custody or seemingly anything else tied to their split. The kids had been living in London as Jolie filmed in the U.K., though Pitt is still based in Los Angeles. Back in June, a judge established a schedule for Pitt to spend time with the kids (other than Maddox, who at 16 the court determined was old enough to decide if he wanted to see his dad or not). As a result, Jolie and the kids returned to Los Angeles.  Then, over the summer of 2018, there were a ton of new stories about the couple. It was nearly impossible to keep all these threads straight, so we organized them for you in handy lists:  Jolie’s lawyer drama:  • In early August 2018, TMZ cited a “source connected to Brad” in reporting that Jolie has been so “hostile” in the divorce proceedings that her allegedly fed-up attorney — celebrity divorce lawyer Laura Wasser — is quitting.  • Then, Jolie’s spokesperson denied TMZ’s report to People, saying Wasser is not quitting “now or in the future. But an “insider” did say the divorce was “entering a new phase.”  • By late August, Jolie confirmed that she was parting ways with Wasser. A spokesperson for Jolie, Mindy Nyby, told People in a statement: “Angelina has decided to change counsel to Samantha Bley Dejean, as Samantha’s expertise is the protection and best interest of children.” Then, a “source” told People that Jolie picked the new attorney as the lead counsel in the case “a month ago.”  The back-and-forth about Pitt’s child support payments:  • In legal documents filed on August 7, Jolie’s attorney claimed “Pitt has paid no meaningful child support since separation.” Jolie also asked the court to order Pitt to pay her the money she is owed, CNN reports.  • But that same day, a “source” told People that Pitt has actually paid “easily millions” toward child support since the 2016 split.  • Around that same time, documents obtained by the Daily Mail, Pitt said that he has paid more than $1.3 in “bills” for the children and loaned Jolie $8 million — and he wants to collect interest on the loan.  • Jolie countered that a loan “is not child support.”  And of course, the petty tabloid stories:  A constant in the battle between Jolie and Pitt were the seemingly never-ending tabloid stories attacking one party at a time. Here are a select few:  • “Page Six” reported on August 7 that a “source” close to Pitt slammed Jolie’s child support filing as a “publicity stunt.”  • On August 15, Us Weekly had an “exclusive” on how Jolie is attacking Pitt because she knows joint custody is a “done deal.” The story paints Pitt as the victim.  • “Page Six” had a bizarre story on August 20 about how Jolie is jealous of Amal Clooney. It also says that the Clooneys have taken Pitt’s side in the divorce battle. Hmmm …  • A “source” told Entertainment Tonight on August 23 that Pitt is “sickened” that Jolie is letting their custody battle be aired in public.  • Again, “Page Six” went for Jolie on August 25 — with a story about how she is not the “saint” she appears to be. Lainey Gossip points out that by now, it’s clear how these stories about Jolie keep getting out.  Luckily, they eventually reportedly reached a “truce,” which sounds nice.  Entertainment Tonight reported in September that Jolie and Pitt had a reached a “truce.” A “source” told ET: “Brad and Angelina actually set up a secret meeting at her house. It’s the first time they have truly gotten together to make things work since their group therapy with the children. Brad and Angie’s meeting was a success. They are going to stay with the plan set forth through the courts.” This reportedly means that they are going to “create a calmer situation for the kids.” Good.  Then, they headed to court in early December.  According to TMZ, a custody hearing date has finally been set for Pitt and Jolie in early December in California. The former pair have reportedly filed docs asking a judge to give them until June to sort out the final details of their divorce (with the use of a private judge, who will also help them figure out the division of property), but on December 4, their custody trial is set to start. TMZ notes that Jolie still wants sole custody, while Pitt wants joint custody of their children. The trial will reportedly take two to three weeks.  And now, they’re both legally single (though not yet technically divorced).  E! News reports that as of Friday, a judge has declared both Pitt and Jolie to be legally single. The judge issued a bifurcated judgment, according to The Blast, which means that their marriage is essentially over, even though they are still finalizing their divorce settlement and custody agreement.

2986,"Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced back in February that they were divorcing after two-and-a-half years of marriage, and since the split, they both have leaned on friends for love and support. Specifically, Theroux has turned to pal Emma Stone quite a bit recently. Cameras have spotted the two grabbing a bite to eat in New York and vacationing together late last month in France.  Now, according to Life & Style, the 46-year-old actor is planning to move in with Stone – who lives in Bel Air, not far from Aniston – even though New York is his home.  “Jen’s worst nightmare is about to come true,” says an insider. “He’s told friends he’s moving to LA for a while, and it looks like he’ll be staying at Emma’s house. It’s the ultimate girl-code betrayal. Poor Jen just can’t seem to catch a break.”  The source goes on to reveal that things are heating up between Theroux and Stone, and they could “become Hollywood’s next power couple.” And for Aniston, this could end up being similar to an experience she after her last divorce – avoiding her ex and his new woman on the red carpet and at Hollywood events, like she did with her first husband Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  MANIAC 2018? #thatsawrap #bts A post shared by @ justintheroux on Dec 11, 2017 at 10:45am PST  Meanwhile, People Magazine is reporting that Aniston is moving on with her life and not dwelling on the past. Their source says that the former Friends star is happy being single and hanging out with friends like Jason Bateman and Ellen DeGeneres.  Right after her split from Theroux, Aniston laid low for a couple of months. But lately, she has been stepping out more in public, and cameras recently caught her having dinner with Courtney Cox at the National Resources Defense Council benefit.  Aniston has also been working, and recently went to Montreal, Canada to film her new Netflix movie with Adam Sandler. Aniston and Sandler were co-stars of the 2011 romantic comedy Just Go With It, and in their latest project they play a couple suspected of murder after the death of a billionaire.  Justin Theroux, our cover guy for the July/August issue, has it all figured out. We talked to him about his bikes, his tats, and how he's managed to look like he hasn't aged in 46 years. Read the full story here: https://t.co/KY53Ecc8z0 pic.twitter.com/tV6V97Xfqj — Men's Health Mag (@MensHealthMag) June 20, 2018  The 46-year-old also reportedly has another project in the works – a Netflix show with Tig Notaro who plays the first female President of the United States who is also openly gay. Will Ferrell, Adam McKay and Stephanie Allyne will produce the show along with Aniston.  This will be Aniston’s first television project since Friends ended in 2004. After that iconic show ended she shifted her focus to film and starred in projects like He’s Just Not That Into You and Horrible Bosses.  In addition to her acting career, Aniston has started some business ventures, like her own perfume line that she launched in 2010. She also is involved in multiple philanthropic efforts, including supporting AmeriCares and donating to last year’s hurricane victims.

3947,"Wait, did Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani tie the knot when no one was looking? The two are reportedly already husband and wife, having gotten married in a secret ceremony on his ranch!  Surprise! In a year that has seen so many surprise engagements, it seems Blake Shelton, 42, and Gwen Stefani, 49, one-upped everyone by having a surprise wedding! The two got married in March, insiders tell Star magazine, and for the past six months, the two have kept their marriage a secret! The alleged wedding took place at Blake’s Tishomingo, Oklahoma ranch, at a “small gazebo by the lake,” where 45 friends and family members watched. “It was super intimate. Not even locals in Tish knew it was happening,” an insider tells Star.  “It was the most perfect day,” the source says. “Simple and full of love. You could tell these two are soulmates. Blake shed a few tears during the ceremony – he’s a big softy at heart.” Gwent’s dress was “a gorgeous fitted pure white” number “It was nothing over the top, just like the ceremony itself.” Among the witnessed seeing these two reportedly get wed were Gwen’s parents – Dennis and Patti – and her three kids, Kingston, 12, Zuma, 9, and Apollo, 4. Supposedly, Blake had Gwen’s family fly into Oklahoma’s Durant airport, before they were ferried to his 2,000-acre hunting ranch.  Guests for this secret ceremony, according to Star, enjoyed a few days of hunting, fishing, and dirt bike riding in the lead-up to the nuptials. “There were cookouts and campfires, and Blake showed off his own herds of deer, antelope and wildebeests,” the source says. “Aside from the custom-made gazebo and glamping facilities, everything else was done in house.” The wedding “wouldn’t have cost them much more than $20,000,” the source says, “which is surprising, but that’s the kind of low-key life they enjoy together.” What’s really a surprise is that Star reports Blake’s ex, Miranda Lambert, 34, “even sent a congratulatory text when she heard the rumors! There’s no hard feelings.”  While the idea that 45 people have been able to keep Gwen and Blake’s marriage a secret for half a year seems crazy, 2018 is the year where that kind of madness happens all the time. After all, Cardi B and Offset pulled of the same stunt. The couple was married in September 2017, one month before he “proposed” to her. The two were secretly married for nine months before Offset inadvertently let the cat out of the bad at the BET Awards by calling Cardi “my wife.” So, along with that and all the surprise engagements – Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin, Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas – could Blake and Gwen really be married?",fake

8768,"It was a whirlwind courtship and marriage for Luann de Lesseps and Tom D’Agostino, and now it’s a whirlwind divorce. Too bad the Real Housewives Of New York reunion filmed before Lu confirmed the split. Oh, the drama we could’ve had. Andy Cohen should request a do-over.  So many rumors, so few days of marriage! Although Luann only announced last week that her marriage was officially over, Luann and Tom seemed to be over since they began.  Following news of their divorce, rumors swirled that Luann caught Tom being unfaithful, and that she was even rekindling things with ex-boyfriend Jacques. Reportedly, Luann and Tom even had a very public fight where she slapped him. Luann has already denied that infidelity played a role in their split and explained that they simply grew apart. Which is kind of what cheating is, right?!  RELATED – RHONY Castmates React To Luann’s Divorce  Now a source claims that we’ve had it all wrong and that Luann never considered Tom anything more than a showmance. The source told The Daily Mail that Luann only married Tom because she was “becoming irrelevant on [RHONY] and needed a new story line,” which is why she was never bothered by his affairs and Housewives hookups.  And contrary to the Legend Of The Head Of Heels In Love Luann, the source insists it was actually TOM who was madly in love with her and is having a “difficult time” accepting that he was used for RHONY. Has he been talking to Jason Hoppy lately? Yes, apparently Tom was soooooooo in love he cheated, right?!  The allegations go even further, accusing Luann not just of being unfaithful, but also asserting that she “was prone to violent outbursts,” which left Tom bruised and bloodied. “It does not take much for her to punch, bite, slap or scratch him,” the insider revealed. Is that source Ramona?  Tom is now denouncing the lurid tale. In a statement issued through his rep, he defends Luann and maintains that the exes are on good terms despite the split. “There is no truth in this at all,” Tom’s rep told People. “Tom and Luann spoke this morning and they have been nothing but kind to each other.”  The countess also doesn’t believe Tom continued cheating. “We were having problems and we tried really hard to fix things,” Luann shared with Page Six, “and we finally came to the conclusion it was just not going to work.”  RELATED – Photos From Real Housewives of New York Reunion  Personally, I think Luann got caught up in the idea of finding love again, and when Tom cheated, she dug her heels in to prove their love was real and avoid embarrassment. Luann didn’t appear to be faking happiness. It’s sad they could not work it out, but it was probably for the best. Perhaps the third time’s a charm for the Countess no-more!  Luann changed her last name back to “de Lesseps” on Twitter and Instagram, so that means this divorce is like for-realz, y’all!  TELL US – DO YOU THINK LUANN ONLY MARRIED TOM FOR RHONY?!

The 57-year-old Chicago PD star married actress Angie Janu in 2000 and the pair share two children, 14-year-old Bix and 11-year-old Bo.  Beghe notes in his filing that he will pay spousal support to his estranged partner, but wishes to keep some assets he inherited out of the divorce proceedings.  Jason Beghe filed for divorce from his wife of 17 years on Thursday, citing 'irreconcilable differences,'  The Californication actor had recently been 'investigated' by NBC for his behavior on the set of Chicago PD 'that some [cast and crew] said constituted sexual harassment', according to Deadline.  According to The Blast, the Thelma And Louise actor 'will pay up spousal support, but does list a few inherited properties he wants to keep separate in the divorce.'  He is also applying for joint legal and physical custody of their children.  The veteran actor 'has apparently consistently used highly aggressive and sexually suggestive language' on the set of his NBC show, as well as 'intimidating' behavior, according to Deadline.  Happier times: Beghe and wife Angie Janu are pictured here in 1997  Beghe was investigated by NBC last year over claims he bullied his colleagues on the show's cast and crew.  'People felt disrespected, he yelled a tremendous amount, he had a quick fuse and when it was set off, it was unpleasant for everyone around him,' an insider told Variety.  Numerous people affiliated the with program complained about the behavior of Beghe, a New York native, citing a penchant for remarks that offended his peers, the outlet reported.  Mercurial: Chicago P.D. actor Jason Beghe, 57, was investigated by NBC human resources last year amid claims he was a bully toward colleagues on the TV program. Pictured May 2017  According to Deadline, an insider noted that some actors were physically injured amid stunts and conflicts with the actor.  Beghe's misbehavior also factored into actress Sophia Bush's decision to leave the show, a source told Variety.

It’s an ongoing process, and it has been a humbling one.  'It is a source of great pride for me to be part of Chicago P.D.’s incredible cast and crew. I have personally apologized to anyone who I have upset, and I am committed to doing what is necessary to make up any damage that I may have caused.'  NBC issued a statement with the companies that producing the show, Universal Television and Wolf Entertainment, indicating they 'promptly began an investigation' when they were apprised of the situation, have 'already taken action,' and 'continue to monitor very closely to ensure all of our employees feel safe and supported.'",real

Hollywood came dressed to kill Sunday night, filling the Emmys carpet with elegant mermaid silhouettes and dramatic beaded gowns and colorful suits. And while some looks weren't as killer as others, all in all, there were far more winners than losers on the Emmys red carpet, so consider this year's worst-dressed list graded on a curve.  Ariel Winter  The Modern Family actress looks her best when she channels old-Hollywood glam on the red carpet, and this Forever 21-looking Zuhair Murad creation is decidedly not that. The animal print-style pattern, paired with a bizarre double-slit, does nothing for Winter.  Sarah Hyland  This is a pumpkin spice latte in a dress. Hyland's Zac Posen leaf-pattern gown with matching eye shadow and earrings was a little too autumnal for our tastes.  Heidi Klum  With her oversize hoops, bangles piled up her arms and boho Peter Dundas gown, Klum looked like she got lost en route to a music festival and stumbled onto the Emmys carpet.  Chris Sullivan  Willy Wonka called — he wants his hat back. The This Is Us actor was certainly trying to turn heads with his dapper Emmys look. But did he really need to bring a cane?  Vanessa Bayer  There's a fine line between ""prim florals"" and ""grandma's drapes,"" and Bayer's Zac Posen gown falls on the wrong side.  Shannon Purser  We love nearly everything about Purser — her Emmy-nominated turn as Barb on Stranger Things, her effervescent personality, and her radically honest interviews. This dowdy emerald tent of a dress, not so much.  Carrie Coon  Coon is undeniably one of Hollywood's favorite critical darlings, but her pink Delpozo gown is twin parts girlish and unflattering.  Reese Witherspoon  In a less competitive year, Reese's Stella McCartney blazer dress wouldn't be offensive enough to land her on the worst-dressed list. But compared with all the other women who looked fantastic in menswear on the carpet Sunday night, Witherspoon just looks like she forgot her pants.  Kathryn Hahn  Hahn dared to wear vintage to the Emmys, choosing a 1969 Courreges Haute Couture strapless gown. Unfortunately, her look was a little too retro, looking less "" '60s chic"" and more ""missing Mad Men extra.""  Sofia Vergara’s bangs  Vergara was among the many stars who opted for a mermaid gown, looking vaguely bridal in white Mark Zunino. But her new center-parted bangs were her look's true offender.",real

4645,"Pippa Middleton knows what it’s like to have someone steal the spotlight at a wedding – in part, because she herself did exactly that at her own sister’s wedding. Lest some of you have forgotten, Pippa famously stole the thunder at Kate Middleton‘s wedding by wearing *that* dress, the one that all the tabloids and publications were talking about for weeks on end after the wedding was over. In fact, major publications spent more time covering Pippa’s dress than Kate’s actual wedding, a fact that did not go unnoticed by the royals or Kate.  Since then, Pippa’s been taking a much more low-key role in her relationship with the media and publicity, with exceptions every now and then. But because of her history at thunder-stealing, she understands how easy it is for attention at weddings to drift to someone other than the bride – and in this particular circumstance, it’s almost a given that it will happen to her.  According to recent reports, Pippa Middleton is worried that inviting Meghan Markle, Prince Harry’s beau, to her wedding will shift the attention away from her wedding and onto Meghan. As we saw a few days ago, Meghan Markle attended Prince Harry’s friend’s wedding in Jamaica, and all anyone in the media cared about the next few days was Meghan. And unfortunately, Pippa Middleton is clearly a lot more attention-hungry than Harry’s friends (who are reportedly generally down-to-earth), which means that she’s much less likely to want Meghan at her wedding.  Sources tell the Daily Mail that Pippa definitely noticed how events played out at the wedding in the Caribbean, explaining, “She saw how all eyes were on Meghan rather than Lara (the bride) last week. The situation was also stressful for Harry. Pippa and her mother Carole wonder whether Meghan’s presence could cause a great deal of unnecessary chaos.”  According to the same source, Pippa is now employing a “no ring, no guest” policy which will ensure that the only people who attend her wedding will be guests and their married spouses – which would essentially eliminate Meghan. However, being that it’s Prince Harry we’re talking about, you think he wouldn’t make his own rules on who he could bring? Can you imagine him NOT bringing Meghan Markle to his own sister-in-law’s wedding, given that he took her to a friend’s wedding?  What do you guys think?

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “This is one of my most exciting announcements, but also one of my most vulnerable. So here goes…. I am pregnant!!” Platten began in her caption. “I can’t believe I’m finally typing these words – I have wanted to share this news for months.”  “As I thought about how to share what I have been experiencing, I became paralyzed about doing it the exact, perfect way — how to express all of my total bliss and yet all this fear too?” she continued.  “I finally realized that I can’t worry about making being ME comfortable for everybody else, I have to share this journey MY WAY: with honesty, vulnerability, love and an open heart,” Platten wrote.

It’s a total miracle that I’m growing a human and my husband and I couldn’t be more thrilled,” she wrote. “But, I have also had an incredibly difficult spring and summer with serious nausea, exhaustion, constant sickness and all the awful symptoms no one wants to really talk about when sharing the ‘perfect blessed journey’ of pregnancy.”  “I was so afraid that if I shared that part (the difficulty of flying and performing while puking in green rooms and airplanes) that I’d seem ungrateful somehow when I’m actually crazy full of gratitude — I’m just HUMAN,” Platten explained. “Human emotions are complex. We can feel more than one thing at once you know? We can hold both love and wonder and aw and joy, but also frustration and sickness and fear and darker stuff too and it’s normal!”  She continued, “With all the mystery and wonder around this, one thing that has been abundantly clear to me: this little unbelievable soul that I haven’t even met yet is going to be my biggest teacher in the world and I cannot wait to learn.”  Image zoom Rachel Platten Neilson Barnard/Getty  RELATED VIDEO: Rachel Platten Opens Up About the Emotional Stories She Receives from Her Fans    The Wildfire singer — who released her sophomore album Waves last October — previously opened up to PEOPLE about how her husband helped inspire her song “Collide.”",real
16768,"The Roseanne reboot–which aired on ABC on March 27th to a whopping 18.2 million viewers–has been met with critical acclaim and a flurry of opinion pieces. The crux of the controversy lies in Roseanne Barr’s politics–both from her character and in real life.  The divided reception among LGBT viewers falls not just along lines of liberal/conservative viewpoints but also asks questions about the way queerness is represented on television. The Connors have added some contemporary updates to their family after 20 years: D.J. (Michael Fishman) is back from the military with a biracial daughter, and Darlene (Sara Gilbert) has a 9-year-old son, Mark (Ames McNamara), who is gender-nonconforming–a fact which becomes the brunt of many jokes between Roseanne and her husband Dan (John Goodman). Roseanne’s treatment of her gender-fluid grandchild makes for some of the more heartwarming moments in a show otherwise fraught with divisive politics. This is due in large part, I imagine, to the presence of GLAAD media consultants and the brilliant lesbian comedian Wanda Sykes in the writers’ room.  The reboot is undeniably well-written and entertaining, and the appearance of a character on TV who challenges gender stereotypes represents a step in the right direction. However, I would argue the family’s acceptance of Mark serves more as a distraction from the disturbing anti-LGBT policies of Trump–and by extension Roseanne–than as a sign of real social progress. LGBT viewers and our allies should not let Roseanne’s gentle tug at our heartstrings erase her history of spewing hateful rhetoric against the transgender, Muslim, and immigrant communities.  Roxane Gay, commenting on the difficulty in separating the art from the artist, writes in an op-ed for the New York Times: “There are times when we can consume problematic pop culture, but this is not one of those times.” I couldn’t agree more. Like Roxane Gay–who (full disclosure) happens to be one of my idols–I watched the first two episodes and enjoyed them, but I’m choosing not to continue further down the road with the Conner clan.  If you are a fan and want to keep watching, I don’t think you are a bad person or even any less committed to progressive ideals. I would challenge viewers, however, to remain vigilant about the ways in which the show uses LGBT representation as a clever ruse to normalize policies that are antithetical to both our civil rights and human dignity.  UPDATE: On May 29, 2018, ABC announced that it was canceling the show following a racist tweet from Roseanne Barr.  For reasons that remain unclear to me, ABC found nothing wrong with Roseanne’s past racist and transphobic remarks and gave her show a reboot anyway. The only thing surprising about this ordeal is that anyone is surprised at all. We knew all along what we were getting when tuning into Roseanne–bigotry masquerading as entertainment.",real

Cheryl Cole shut down a report that suggested her boyfriend, Liam Payne, was acting inappropriately with one his dancers.  “I usually don’t bother myself to respond to stupid articles. But in my silence they hold the pen,” the singer, 34, tweeted onFriday, March 30. “This is a stupid article, clutching at very small straws. But I can’t ignore this story involving an innocent dancer colleague of Liam’s who has a fiancé, and dragging them into this desperate attempt to try to cause problems between Liam and I. Nor do I understand the daily onslaught of stories.”  “The other ‘mystery woman’ in the story happens to be my long-term friend and manager (that’s embarrassing) I also happen to love Katy Perry,” she wrote, adding a shrugging emoji. Cole’s mention of the “Chained to the Rhythm” singer, 33, is likely in reference to the former One Direction guy, 24, being criticized after he shared an Instagram photo of himself hugging Perry on Tuesday, March 27.

The next week we’re splitting up,” Payne said in his cover story for London’s ES magazine, published on March 21. “And the thing for me is, I just like to think we’re somewhere in the middle. You know, we have our struggles — like, of course, I’m not gonna sit here and say that everything’s absolutely fine and dandy, because of course you go through different things, and that’s what a relationship is.”  He added: “But we go through them together as a family and that’s the most important thing for me.”  The duo, who has been dealing with speculation about their relationship since they first got together, shut down break up rumors by making a rare appearance as a couple on the red carpet at the 2018 Brit Awards in February. The pair first met in 2008 when the “Bedroom Floor” singer auditioned for The X Factor when the former Girls Aloud member was a judge on the U.K. singing competition show. They began dating in 2015 and are now parents to their 1-year-old son, Bear.",real

Expand Close Press Association Images / Facebook  Twitter  Email  Whatsapp  Beckham – who reportedly scuppered a full Spice Girls reunion last year – is shown making a love heart with her hands while Bunton sings along to the track.  Mel C, full name Melanie Chisholm, told the Press Association it was a “shame” her namesake could not make it a full line-up.  The 43-year-old said: “I don’t want it to look negative because it’s not, it’s not a big deal, I reached out to lots of other people and everyone’s busy.  “She didn’t get round to doing it and obviously it does concern me… I think people will pick up on that but I don’t want anything to be made of it.”  “Having four of the Spice Girls in it is really special,” she said, adding: “Geri’s in there briefly, Emma’s done a really lovely one and last but not least Victoria Beckham found time to do a little one for me.”  Natalie Imbruglia and KT Tunstall also appear in the video which Mel C said she was inspired to create after performing to an energetic crowd in Brazil.  The singer said there were no plans for a full Spice Girls reunion “in the pipeline” after she rejected the chance to join Horner, Bunton and Mel B in a 20th anniversary celebration of Wannabe last summer.  She said performing as a four-piece would not have done “the band or fans justice” after Beckham opted against joining the comeback.  But she added: “I just didn’t feel like it was right and so if everyone was feeling it at some point, I’m not against the idea.  “But I think it would have to be all five really.”  PA Media",real

Clooney and his wife, human-rights attorney Amal Clooney, announced a $500,000 donation Tuesday morning to help offset the costs of the march in Washington.  “Amal and I are so inspired by the courage and eloquence of these young men and women,” George Clooney said in a statement. “Our family will be there on March 24 to stand side by side with this incredible generation of young people from all over the country, and in the name of our children Ella and Alexander, we’re donating 500,000 dollars to help pay for this groundbreaking event.

416,"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Daily Money Sign up to receive the latest updates and the smartest advice. Sign Up Now  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” meaning that whatever she wears more or less sells out immediately across the globe. Some designer labels she has worn have had to double their staff just to keep up with demand after a photo of her in a particular outfit is published.

17150,"The series based on the IDW novel of the same name has landed a 10-episode order at the streaming giant.  Netflix and Ian Somerhalder are ready to fight the V-Wars.  The streaming giant has handed out a 10-episode, straight-to-series order for vampire drama V-Wars, based on the IDW novel of the same name, with the Vampire Diaries alum set to star. The order comes as another IDW property, the beloved Locke and Key, is awaiting word on a new home after Hulu's surprising pass on the pilot.  V-Wars revolves around Dr. Luther Swann (Somerhalder), who enters a world of horror when a mysterious disease transforms his best friend, Michael Fayne, into a murderous predator who feeds on other humans. As the disease spreads and more people are transformed, society fractures into opposing camps pitting normal people against the growing number of these vampires. Swann races against time to understand what’s happening, while Fayne rises to become the powerful underground leader of the vampires.  The series is based on IDW Publishing's V-Wars franchise, written by New York Times best-selling author Jonathan Maberry. High Park Entertainment produces alongside IDW Entertainment, which will distribute the series worldwide (excluding Canada). 1-800-Missing creators William Laurin and Glenn Davis will serve as showrunners. Brad Turner (Stargate, Stargate Atlantis) will direct and exec produce. High Park's Eric Birnberg and Thomas Walden will exec produce alongside IDW Entertainment president David Ozer, IDW CEO Ted Adams and Marada Pictures' James Gibb.  ""We could not have dreamed of a better choice than Ian Somerhalder to bring his keen understanding of this genre from his years of starring in The Vampire Diaries to lead the cast of V-Wars as Dr. Luther Swann and to be a creative force on this series, as well as to serve as a director this season. We are thrilled to partner with Netflix to bring the multifaceted world that Jonathan Maberry created to audiences worldwide.""  V-Wars was first announced in 2014 as part of a straight-to-series deal with Entertainment One. That company, as well as the drama's original writer and producers Circle of Confusion are no longer attached. The pickup comes as IDW's Locke and Key is being shopped to other streaming outlets, among others, as the company looks to find a new home for the Carlton Cuse drama based on Joe Hill's beloved comic series. Despite multiple attempts to bring the series to both the big and small screen, IDW remains committed to finding the project a creative home.  For Somerhalder, meanwhile, V-Wars arrives a year after he signed off of The CW's Vampire Diaries following its eight-season run. He currently has a pod deal with TVD producers Warner Bros. Television with actress Nikki Reed, his wife, via their Rare Bird Productions banner. He is repped by ICM Partners, Untitled Entertainment and Morris Yorn.  V-Wars arrives as Netflix continues to spend an estimated $8 billion annually on original programming. The genre drama joins a roster of Marvel fare including the recently renewed Jessica Jones and gives the streamer a series vampire drama as The CW is prepping the final season of Vampire Diaries spinoff The Originals, while working on yet another offshoot from the franchise. The genre remains popular with NBC's Midnight, Texas, and Syfy's Van Helsing, among others.",real

1808,"""007"" redirects here. For other uses, see 007 (disambiguation)  Media franchise about a British spy  The James Bond series focuses on a fictional British Secret Service agent created in 1953 by writer Ian Fleming, who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelisations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz. The latest novel is Forever and a Day by Anthony Horowitz, published in May 2018. Additionally Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny.  The character—also known by the code number 007—has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strip, video games and film. The films are the longest continually running film series of all time and have grossed over US$7.040 billion in total, making it the sixth-highest-grossing film series to date, which started in 1962 with Dr. No, starring Sean Connery as Bond. As of 2020, there have been twenty-four films in the Eon Productions series. The most recent Bond film, Spectre (2015), stars Daniel Craig in his fourth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series. There have also been two independent productions of Bond films: Casino Royale (a 1967 spoof) and Never Say Never Again (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, Thunderball). In 2015 the series was estimated to be worth $19.9 billion,[1] making James Bond one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.  The Bond films are renowned for a number of features, including the musical accompaniment, with the theme songs having received Academy Award nominations on several occasions, and two wins. Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond's cars, his guns, and the gadgets with which he is supplied by Q Branch. The films are also noted for Bond's relationships with various women, who are sometimes referred to as ""Bond girls"".  Publication history  Creation and inspiration  Ian Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond as the central figure for his works. Bond is an intelligence officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond is known by his code number, 007, and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander. Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division and 30 Assault Unit during the Second World War, admitting that Bond ""was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war"".[2] Among those types were his brother, Peter, who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war.[3] Aside from Fleming's brother, a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond's make up, including Conrad O'Brien-ffrench, Patrick Dalzel-Job and Bill ""Biffy"" Dunderdale.[2]  The name James Bond came from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies. Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that ""It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born"".[4] He further explained that:  When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument ... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [James Bond] is the dullest name I ever heard. Ian Fleming, The New Yorker, 21 April 1962[5]  On another occasion, Fleming said: ""I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers'. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure—an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department.""  Fleming decided that Bond should resemble both American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself and in Casino Royale, Vesper Lynd remarks, ""Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless."" Likewise, in Moonraker, Special Branch Officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is ""certainly good-looking ... Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes were cold.""  Fleming endowed Bond with many of his own traits, including sharing the same golf handicap, the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries. Bond's tastes are also often taken from Fleming's own as was his behaviour,[9] with Bond's love of golf and gambling mirroring Fleming's own. Fleming used his experiences of his espionage career and all other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing, including using names of school friends, acquaintances, relatives and lovers throughout his books.[2]  It was not until the penultimate novel, You Only Live Twice, that Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background. The book was the first to be written after the release of Dr. No in cinemas and Sean Connery's depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character, to give Bond both a sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories. In a fictional obituary, purportedly published in The Times, Bond's parents were given as Andrew Bond, from the village of Glencoe, Scotland, and Monique Delacroix, from the canton of Vaud, Switzerland. Fleming did not provide Bond's date of birth, but John Pearson's fictional biography of Bond, James Bond: The Authorized Biography of 007, gives Bond a birth date on 11 November 1920, while a study by John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921.  Novels and related works  Ian Fleming novels  Goldeneye , in Jamaica, where Fleming wrote all the Bond novels  Whilst serving in the Naval Intelligence Division, Fleming had planned to become an author[15] and had told a friend, ""I am going to write the spy story to end all spy stories.""[2] On 17 February 1952, he began writing his first James Bond novel, Casino Royale, at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, where he wrote all his Bond novels during the months of January and February each year. He started the story shortly before his wedding to his pregnant girlfriend, Ann Charteris, in order to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials.  After completing the manuscript for Casino Royale, Fleming showed it to his friend (and later editor) William Plomer to read. Plomer liked it and submitted it to the publishers, Jonathan Cape, who did not like it as much. Cape finally published it in 1953 on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother Peter, an established travel writer. Between 1953 and 1966, two years after his death, twelve novels and two short-story collections were published, with the last two books – The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights – published posthumously. All the books were published in the UK through Jonathan Cape.  Post-Fleming novels  After Fleming's death a continuation novel, Colonel Sun, was written by Kingsley Amis (as Robert Markham) and published in 1968.[34] Amis had already written a literary study of Fleming's Bond novels in his 1965 work The James Bond Dossier. Although novelisations of two of the Eon Productions Bond films appeared in print, James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me and James Bond and Moonraker, both written by screenwriter Christopher Wood,[36] the series of novels did not continue until the 1980s. In 1981 the thriller writer John Gardner picked up the series with Licence Renewed. Gardner went on to write sixteen Bond books in total; two of the books he wrote – Licence to Kill and GoldenEye – were novelisations of Eon Productions films of the same name. Gardner moved the Bond series into the 1980s, although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them. In 1996 Gardner retired from writing James Bond books due to ill health.[39]  In 1996 the American author Raymond Benson became the author of the Bond novels. Benson had previously been the author of The James Bond Bedside Companion, first published in 1984.[54] By the time he moved on to other, non-Bond related projects in 2002, Benson had written six Bond novels, three novelisations and three short stories.[55]  After a gap of six years, Sebastian Faulks was commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications to write a new Bond novel, which was released on 28 May 2008, the 100th anniversary of Fleming's birth.[65] The book—titled Devil May Care—was published in the UK by Penguin Books and by Doubleday in the US.[66] American writer Jeffery Deaver was then commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications to produce Carte Blanche, which was published on 26 May 2011.[67] The book updated Bond into a post-9/11 agent, independent of MI5 or MI6.[68] On 26 September 2013, Solo by William Boyd, set in 1969, was published.[69] In October 2014, it was announced that Anthony Horowitz was to write a Bond continuation novel.[70] Set in the 1950s two weeks after the events of Goldfinger, it contains material written, but previously unreleased, by Fleming. Trigger Mortis was released on 8 September 2015.[71][72][73] Horowitz's second Bond novel, Forever and a Day, tells the origin story of Bond as a 00 agent prior to the events of Casino Royale. The novel, also based on unpublished material from Fleming, was released on 31 May 2018.[74][75]  Young Bond  The Young Bond series of novels was started by Charlie Higson[76] and, between 2005 and 2009, five novels and one short story were published.[77] The first Young Bond novel, SilverFin was also adapted and released as a graphic novel on 2 October 2008 by Puffin Books.[78] In October 2013 Ian Fleming Publications announced that Stephen Cole would continue the series, with the first edition scheduled to be released in Autumn 2014.[79]  The Moneypenny Diaries  The Moneypenny Diaries are a trilogy of novels chronicling the life of Miss Moneypenny, M's personal secretary. The novels are penned by Samantha Weinberg under the pseudonym Kate Westbrook, who is depicted as the book's ""editor"".[87] The first instalment of the trilogy, subtitled Guardian Angel, was released on 10 October 2005 in the UK.[88] A second volume, subtitled Secret Servant was released on 2 November 2006 in the UK, published by John Murray.[89] A third volume, subtitled Final Fling was released on 1 May 2008.[90]  Adaptations  Television  In 1954 CBS paid Ian Fleming $1,000 ($9,520 in 2019 dollars[94]) to adapt his novel Casino Royale into a one-hour television adventure as part of its Climax! series. The episode aired live on 21 October 1954 and starred Barry Nelson as ""Card Sense"" James Bond and Peter Lorre as Le Chiffre. The novel was adapted for American audiences to show Bond as an American agent working for ""Combined Intelligence"", while the character Felix Leiter—American in the novel—became British onscreen and was renamed ""Clarence Leiter"".  In 1973 a BBC documentary Omnibus: The British Hero featured Christopher Cazenove playing a number of such title characters (e.g. Richard Hannay and Bulldog Drummond). The documentary included James Bond in dramatised scenes from Goldfinger—notably featuring 007 being threatened with the novel's circular saw, rather than the film's laser beam—and Diamonds Are Forever.[98] In 1991 a kids's spin-off TV cartoon series, James Bond Jr., was produced with Corey Burton in the role of Bond's nephew, also called James Bond.[99]  Radio  In 1958, the novel Moonraker was adapted for broadcast on South African radio, with Bob Holness providing the voice of Bond.[100][101] According to The Independent, ""listeners across the Union thrilled to Bob's cultured tones as he defeated evil master criminals in search of world domination"".[102]  The BBC have adapted five of the Fleming novels for broadcast: in 1990 You Only Live Twice was adapted into a 90-minute radio play for BBC Radio 4 with Michael Jayston playing James Bond. The production was repeated a number of times between 2008 and 2011.[103] On 24 May 2008 BBC Radio 4 broadcast an adaptation of Dr. No. The actor Toby Stephens, who played Bond villain Gustav Graves in the Eon Productions version of Die Another Day, played Bond, while Dr. No was played by David Suchet.[104] Following its success, a second story was adapted and on 3 April 2010 BBC Radio 4 broadcast Goldfinger with Stephens again playing Bond.[105] Sir Ian McKellen was Goldfinger and Stephens' Die Another Day co-star Rosamund Pike played Pussy Galore. The play was adapted from Fleming's novel by Archie Scottney and was directed by Martin Jarvis.[106] In 2012 the novel From Russia, with Love was dramatised for Radio 4; it featured a full cast again starring Stephens as Bond.[107] In May 2014 Stephens again played Bond, in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, with Alfred Molina as Blofeld, and Joanna Lumley as Irma Bunt.[108]  Comics  John McLusky's rendition of James Bond  In 1957 the Daily Express approached Ian Fleming to adapt his stories into comic strips, offering him £1,500 per novel and a share of takings from syndication. After initial reluctance, Fleming, who felt the strips would lack the quality of his writing, agreed. To aid the Daily Express in illustrating Bond, Fleming commissioned an artist to create a sketch of how he believed James Bond looked. The illustrator, John McLusky, however, felt that Fleming's 007 looked too ""outdated"" and ""pre-war"" and changed Bond to give him a more masculine look. The first strip, Casino Royale was published from 7 July 1958 to 13 December 1958 and was written by Anthony Hern and illustrated by John McLusky.  Most of the Bond novels and short stories have since been adapted for illustration, as well as Kingsley Amis's Colonel Sun; the works were written by Henry Gammidge or Jim Lawrence with Yaroslav Horak replacing McClusky as artist in 1966. After the Fleming and Amis material had been adapted, original stories were produced, continuing in the Daily Express and Sunday Express until May 1977.  Several comic book adaptations of the James Bond films have been published through the years: at the time of Dr. No's release in October 1962, a comic book adaptation of the screenplay, written by Norman J. Nodel, was published in Britain as part of the Classics Illustrated anthology series. It was later reprinted in the United States by DC Comics as part of its Showcase anthology series, in January 1963. This was the first American comic book appearance of James Bond and is noteworthy for being a relatively rare example of a British comic being reprinted in a fairly high-profile American comic. It was also one of the earliest comics to be censored on racial grounds (some skin tones and dialogue were changed for the American market).[115]  With the release of the 1981 film For Your Eyes Only, Marvel Comics published a two-issue comic book adaptation of the film. When Octopussy was released in the cinemas in 1983, Marvel published an accompanying comic; Eclipse also produced a one-off comic for Licence to Kill, although Timothy Dalton refused to allow his likeness to be used.[118] New Bond stories were also drawn up and published from 1989 onwards through Marvel, Eclipse Comics, Dark Horse Comics and Dynamite Entertainment.[119]  Films  Eon Productions films  Eon Productions, the company of Canadian Harry Saltzman and American Albert R. ""Cubby"" Broccoli, released the first cinema adaptation of an Ian Fleming novel, Dr. No (1962), based on the eponymous 1958 novel and featuring Sean Connery as 007.[120] Connery starred in a further four films before leaving the role after You Only Live Twice (1967),[121] which was taken up by George Lazenby for On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969).[122] Lazenby left the role after just one appearance and Connery was brought back for his last Eon-produced film Diamonds Are Forever.  Roger Moore was appointed to the role of 007 for Live and Let Die (1973). He played Bond a further six times over twelve years, before being replaced by Timothy Dalton for two films. After a six-year hiatus, during which a legal wrangle threatened Eon's productions of the Bond films, Irish actor Pierce Brosnan was cast as Bond in GoldenEye (1995); he remained in the role for a total of four films, before leaving in 2002. In 2006, Daniel Craig was given the role of Bond for Casino Royale (2006), which rebooted the series.[125] Craig has appeared for a total of four films, and his fifth is scheduled for release in 2020.[126] The series has grossed almost $7 billion to date, making it the third-highest-grossing film series (behind the Harry Potter and Marvel Cinematic Universe films),[127] and the single most successful adjusted for inflation.[128]  Non-Eon films  In 1967 Casino Royale was adapted into a parody Bond film starring David Niven as Sir James Bond and Ursula Andress as Vesper Lynd. Niven had been Fleming's preference for the role of Bond. The result of a court case in the High Court in London in 1963 allowed Kevin McClory to produce a remake of Thunderball titled Never Say Never Again in 1983.[131] The film, produced by Jack Schwartzman's Taliafilm production company and starring Sean Connery as Bond, was not part of the Eon series of Bond films. In 1997 the Sony Corporation acquired all or some of McClory's rights in an undisclosed deal,[131] which were then subsequently acquired by MGM, whilst on 4 December 1997, MGM announced that the company had purchased the rights to Never Say Never Again from Taliafilm.[132] As of 2015 , Eon holds the full adaptation rights to all of Fleming's Bond novels.[131][133]  Music  The ""James Bond Theme"" was written by Monty Norman and was first orchestrated by the John Barry Orchestra for 1962's Dr. No, although the actual authorship of the music has been a matter of controversy for many years. In 2001, Norman won £30,000 in libel damages from The Sunday Times newspaper, which suggested that Barry was entirely responsible for the composition.[136] The theme, as written by Norman and arranged by Barry, was described by another Bond film composer, David Arnold, as ""bebop-swing vibe coupled with that vicious, dark, distorted electric guitar, definitely an instrument of rock 'n' roll ... it represented everything about the character you would want: It was cocky, swaggering, confident, dark, dangerous, suggestive, sexy, unstoppable. And he did it in two minutes.""[134] Barry composed the scores for eleven Bond films and had an uncredited contribution to Dr. No with his arrangement of the Bond Theme.[134]  A Bond film staple are the theme songs heard during their title sequences sung by well-known popular singers. Several of the songs produced for the films have been nominated for Academy Awards for Original Song, including Paul McCartney's ""Live and Let Die"",[139] Carly Simon's ""Nobody Does It Better"",[140] Sheena Easton's ""For Your Eyes Only"",[141] Adele's ""Skyfall"",[142] and Sam Smith's ""Writing's on the Wall"".[143] Adele won the award at the 85th Academy Awards, and Smith won at the 88th Academy Awards.[144] For the non-Eon produced Casino Royale, Burt Bacharach's score included ""The Look of Love"", which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Song.[145]  Video games  In 1983 the first Bond video game, developed and published by Parker Brothers, was released for the Atari 2600, the Atari 5200, the Atari 800, the Commodore 64 and the ColecoVision.[146] Since then, there have been numerous video games either based on the films or using original storylines. In 1997 the first-person shooter video game GoldenEye 007 was developed by Rare for the Nintendo 64, based on the 1995 Pierce Brosnan film GoldenEye.[147] The game received very positive reviews,[148] won the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Award for UK Developer of the Year in 1998[149] and sold over eight million copies worldwide,[150][151] grossing $250 million.[152]  In 1999 Electronic Arts acquired the licence and released Tomorrow Never Dies on 16 December 1999.[153] In October 2000, they released The World Is Not Enough for the Nintendo 64[155] followed by 007 Racing for the PlayStation on 21 November 2000.[156] In 2003, the company released James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing,[157] which included the likenesses and voices of Pierce Brosnan, Willem Dafoe, Heidi Klum, Judi Dench and John Cleese, amongst others.[158] In November 2005, Electronic Arts released a video game adaptation of 007: From Russia with Love,[159] which involved Sean Connery's image and voice-over for Bond.[159] In 2006 Electronic Arts announced a game based on then-upcoming film Casino Royale: the game was cancelled because it would not be ready by the film's release in November of that year. With MGM losing revenue from lost licensing fees, the franchise was removed from EA to Activision.[160] Activision subsequently released the 007: Quantum of Solace game on 31 October 2008, based on the film of the same name.[161]  A new version of GoldenEye 007 featuring Daniel Craig was released for the Wii and a handheld version for the Nintendo DS in November 2010.[162] A year later a new version was released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 under the title GoldenEye 007: Reloaded.[163][164] In October 2012 007 Legends was released, which featured one mission from each of the Bond actors of the Eon Productions' series.[165]  Guns, vehicles and gadgets  Guns  For the first five novels, Fleming armed Bond with a Beretta 418 until he received a letter from a thirty-one-year-old Bond enthusiast and gun expert, Geoffrey Boothroyd, criticising Fleming's choice of firearm for Bond, calling it ""a lady's gun – and not a very nice lady at that!""[168] Boothroyd suggested that Bond should swap his Beretta for a 7.65mm Walther PPK and this exchange of arms made it to Dr. No. Boothroyd also gave Fleming advice on the Berns-Martin triple draw shoulder holster and a number of the weapons used by SMERSH and other villains. In thanks, Fleming gave the MI6 Armourer in his novels the name Major Boothroyd and, in Dr. No, M introduces him to Bond as ""the greatest small-arms expert in the world"". Bond also used a variety of rifles, including the Savage Model 99 in ""For Your Eyes Only"" and a Winchester .308 target rifle in ""The Living Daylights"". Other handguns used by Bond in the Fleming books included the Colt Detective Special and a long-barrelled Colt .45 Army Special.  The first Bond film, Dr. No, saw M ordering Bond to leave his Beretta behind and take up the Walther PPK, which the film Bond used in eighteen films. In Tomorrow Never Dies and the two subsequent films, Bond's main weapon was the Walther P99 semi-automatic pistol.  Vehicles  In the early Bond stories Fleming gave Bond a battleship-grey Bentley ​4 1⁄ 2 Litre with an Amherst Villiers supercharger. After Bond's car was written off by Hugo Drax in Moonraker, Fleming gave Bond a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he used in the remaining books of the series. During Goldfinger, Bond was issued with an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device, which he used to track Goldfinger across France. Bond returned to his Bentley for the subsequent novels.  The Bond of the films has driven a number of cars, including the Aston Martin V8 Vantage, during the 1980s, the V12 Vanquish and DBS during the 2000s, as well as the Lotus Esprit; the BMW Z3, BMW 750iL and the BMW Z8. He has, however, also needed to drive a number of other vehicles, ranging from a Citroën 2CV to a Routemaster Bus, amongst others.  Bond's most famous car is the silver grey Aston Martin DB5, first seen in Goldfinger; it later featured in Thunderball, GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, Casino Royale, Skyfall and Spectre.[182] The films have used a number of different Aston Martins for filming and publicity, one of which was sold in January 2006 at an auction in the US for $2,1 million to an unnamed European collector.[183] In 2010, another DB5 used in Goldfinger was sold at auction for $4.6m million (£2.6 million).[184]  Gadgets  Little Nellie autogyro with its creator and pilot, Theautogyro with its creator and pilot, Ken Wallis  Fleming's novels and early screen adaptations presented minimal equipment such as the booby-trapped attaché case in From Russia, with Love, although this situation changed dramatically with the films.[185] However, the effects of the two Eon-produced Bond films Dr. No and From Russia with Love had an effect on the novel The Man with the Golden Gun, through the increased number of devices used in Fleming's final story.  For the film adaptations of Bond, the pre-mission briefing by Q Branch became one of the motifs that ran through the series. Dr. No provided no spy-related gadgets, but a Geiger counter was used; industrial designer Andy Davey observed that the first ever onscreen spy-gadget was the attaché case shown in From Russia with Love, which he described as ""a classic 007 product"".[188] The gadgets assumed a higher profile in the 1964 film Goldfinger. The film's success encouraged further espionage equipment from Q Branch to be supplied to Bond, although the increased use of technology led to an accusation that Bond was over-reliant on equipment, particularly in the later films.  ""If it hadn't been for Q Branch, you'd have been dead long ago!"" —Q, to Bond, Licence to Kill  Davey noted that ""Bond's gizmos follow the zeitgeist more closely than any other ... nuance in the films""[188] as they moved from the potential representations of the future in the early films, through to the brand-name obsessions of the later films.[188] It is also noticeable that, although Bond uses a number of pieces of equipment from Q Branch, including the Little Nellie autogyro, a jet pack and the exploding attaché case, the villains are also well-equipped with custom-made devices,[188] including Scaramanga's golden gun, Rosa Klebb's poison-tipped shoes, Oddjob's steel-rimmed bowler hat and Blofeld's communication devices in his agents' vanity case.[188]  Cultural impact  Fleming's Bond novels  Cinematically, Bond has been a major influence within the spy genre since the release of Dr. No in 1962, with 22 secret agent films released in 1966 alone attempting to capitalise on the Bond franchise's popularity and success.[197] The first parody was the 1964 film Carry On Spying, which shows the villain Dr. Crow being overcome by agents who included James Bind (Charles Hawtry) and Daphne Honeybutt (Barbara Windsor).[198] One of the films that reacted against the portrayal of Bond was the Harry Palmer series, whose first film, The Ipcress File was released in 1965. The eponymous hero of the series was what academic Jeremy Packer called an ""anti-Bond"", or what Christoph Lindner calls ""the thinking man's Bond"". The Palmer series were produced by Harry Saltzman, who also used key crew members from the Bond series, including designer Ken Adam, editor Peter R. Hunt and composer John Barry.[201] The four ""Matt Helm"" films starring Dean Martin (released between 1966 and 1969),[202] the ""Flint"" series starring James Coburn (comprising two films, one each in 1966 and 1969), while The Man from U.N.C.L.E. also moved onto the cinema screen, with eight films released: all were testaments to Bond's prominence in popular culture. More recently, the Austin Powers series by writer, producer and comedian Mike Myers, and other parodies such as the Johnny English trilogy of films,[205] have also used elements from or parodied the Bond films.  Following the release of the film Dr. No in 1962, the line ""Bond ... James Bond"", became a catch phrase that entered the lexicon of Western popular culture: writers Cork and Scivally said of the introduction in Dr. No that the ""signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever"". In 2001, it was voted as the ""best-loved one-liner in cinema"" by British cinema goers,[207] and in 2005, it was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the American Film Institute as part of their 100 Years Series.[208] The 2005 American Film Institute's '100 Years' series recognised the character of James Bond himself as the third greatest film hero.[209] He was also placed at number 11 on a similar list by Empire[210] and as the fifth greatest movie character of all time by Premiere.[211]  The 23 James Bond films produced by Eon Productions, which have grossed $4,910 million in box office returns alone,[212] have made the series one of the highest-grossing ever. It is estimated that since Dr. No, a quarter of the world's population have seen at least one Bond film.[213] The UK Film Distributors' Association have stated that the importance of the Bond series of films to the British film industry cannot be overstated, as they ""form the backbone of the industry"".[214]  Television also saw the effect of Bond films, with the NBC series The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,[215] which was described as the ""first network television imitation"" of Bond,[216] largely because Fleming provided advice and ideas on the development of the series, even giving the main character the name Napoleon Solo. Other 1960s television series inspired by Bond include I Spy, and Get Smart.  A British cultural icon, by 2012, James Bond had become such a symbol of the United Kingdom that the character, played by Craig, appeared in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics as Queen Elizabeth II's escort.[219][220] From 1968 to 2003, and since 2016, the Cadbury chocolate box Milk Tray has been advertised by the 'Milk Tray Man', a tough James Bond–style figure who undertakes daunting 'raids' to surreptitiously deliver a box of Milk Tray chocolates to a lady.[221][222]  Throughout the life of the film series, a number of tie-in products have been released. In 2018 a James Bond museum opened atop of Austrian Alps.[224] The futuristic museum is constructed on the summit of Gaislachkogl Mountain in Sölden at 10,000 ft (3,048 m) above sea level.[225][226]  Criticisms  The James Bond character and related media have triggered a number of criticisms and reactions across the political spectrum, and are still highly debated in popular culture studies.[227][228] Some observers accuse the Bond novels and films of misogyny and sexism.[229] Geographers have considered the role of exotic locations in the movies in the dynamics of the Cold War, with power struggles among blocs playing out in the peripheral areas.[230] Other critics claim that the Bond films reflect imperial nostalgia.[231][232]  See also  References",fake
13510,"Season four episode ""ArkAngel"" (now streaming) was directed by Foster, the first woman to step behind the camera for an episode of the Netflix anthology.  [Warning: This story contains spoilers from the Black Mirror season four episode, ""ArkAngel.""]  Though Black Mirror is an anthology comprised of standalone stories, one of the new season four episodes sticks out from the rest in an unassuming way.  ""ArkAngel,"" directed by Jodie Foster and starring Rosemarie DeWitt, doesn't bring with it the typical futuristic, hyper-technology backdrop that can easily be spotted in the episodes of Charlie Brooker's dystopian series. Instead, there is only one gadget on display in this intimate story of a single mother (DeWitt) who is desperate to keep her child safe: the ArkAngel, an experimental brain chip and corresponding tablet that tracks a child's every movement and gives the parent an option to censor experiences.  The story (which is streaming now on Netflix with all of season four) follows the child's life, one that is monitored by Marie (DeWitt) even when the product is discontinued. When the daughter blossoms into a teenager (played by Brenna Harding) and discovers her mother's betrayal, she nearly bludgeons her mother to death with the tablet and runs off, leaving DeWitt's character alone to live out her worst fear of abandonment.  The decision to tell a stripped down story was intentional for Foster, who tells The Hollywood Reporter she was most interested in exploring the nuances of the mother-daughter relationship at the heart of the story. The Academy-award winning actress, who also becomes the first female director of the entire Netflix series with the season four episode, says she was influenced by her own relationship with her mother, a single parent, when bringing creator-writer Brooker's script to life. Her star and friend DeWitt, a mother of two, adds that the end result wouldn't have been the same without Foster's eye or her combined life experience as an actor, daughter and mother.  ""This story is much more an exploration of the human psyche and of our own fragile, messed up psychologies that are just highlighted by the reflection of technology and how we use it — and how responsible or irresponsible we are regarding it,"" Foster tells THR. In a chat below, both Foster and DeWitt peel back the layers of their episode to relive that difficult scene, share their interpretations of the gut-wrenching ending and discuss why more female stories aren't being told: ""I’ve made, I don’t know, 55 movies,"" says Foster, ""and I’ve only worked with a female director once in my whole life.""  Were you each fans of Black Mirror and how did your roles with ""ArkAngel"" come about?  Jodie Foster: I had never seen Black Mirror before. I was having lunch with [vp original content at Netflix] Cindy Holland bemoaning the film industry and saying how I really wanted to figure out how to do features on cable. I really think that some stories should be an hour and a half; they shouldn’t be eight episodes long. She said, “I think I’ve got something for you.” Then I watched all the Black Mirrors, they sent me the script and that was it.  Rosemarie DeWitt: I hadn’t seen Black Mirror either. When Jodie offered me the role, I watched a bunch and then I started feeling really anxious because they were so good that I stopped watching them. I was like, “OK, we just need to go make ours!”  After bingeing so many episodes in a row, did the show influence your thoughts on technology?  Foster: It didn’t give me the fear of technology so much because we really live with it. This story kind of feels like now. Or that we’re on the path to it.  A lot of the Black Mirror episodes deal with far-fetched techno-paranoia ideas, but the concept of tracking your child — Marie's (DeWitt) intent when signing her daughter up for a trial with the ArkAngel — is already happening today. Not to mention helicopter parenting. How did that make this story more relatable?  DeWitt: The humanizing aspect of this story is something that I definitely felt was on the page when I read the script, and then I really fought hard to bring her psychology through in filming. There are so few moments — since this episode is so tightly crafted and it spans such a long time — that I felt like Jodie was really meticulous in finding the moments that showed that this woman, my character, had a lot of baggage. She had experienced some loss and bad experiences, and there was not only this need to protect her daughter but an overall need of her daughter that was sort of self-serving, too, and that was going to put her in great danger of misusing this tool. It wasn’t just an every woman. Even though I think that every parent can relate to it, there is a specificity to this story.  Foster: I really love the tapestry. That really tightly woven, incredibly intricate Ingmar Bergman tapestry of the relationship between mothers and daughters. And the natural progression of that. I had a really connected, very difficult relationship with my mom. She was in every part of my life, including my work, and it was a beautiful relationship — the most significant relationship I’ll ever have — and also, really painful. Individuating from her was one of the hardest things that I’ve ever done.  In what ways were you able to you pull from your own personal experience?  Foster: I think I understood both sides of the coin. You always do that in films. You’re always looking at every character and saying, “Oh, I understand that because of this.” You relate it to your own experiences. What is interesting about the episode is that you start off thinking it’s the mother’s story and that it’s her perspective, and then as time goes on, you realize it flips to the daughter Sara’s perspective. Then it kind of flips back again. And that's because they are the same person. She came out of her body. You witness the child coming out of her body in the first few seconds. There’s no clean distinction between a mother and a daughter and that distinction has to be made by the daughter in an individuation moment.  At the end, when Sara (Harding) nearly kills her mother, she was still being censored by the ArkAngel. Ultimately she realizes what she's done, but she still leaves her alone in the house, in a pool of her own blood. Did you debate having her actually kill her mother?  Foster: I thought Charlie [Brooker] nailed it with what you saw. I don’t think we ever felt like we needed to take it to that place where we say, “And the moral of the story is: And she died.” There was a next lesson for this fable.  DeWitt: She needed to experience the loss of her daughter, which is the thing she has been trying to safeguard against her whole life. It’s really her worst fear coming true.  What was that scene like to film?  DeWitt: That was a hard scene to shoot. Not only because it was so precise — the writing of Black Mirror is so precise, the way Jodie directed this episode was so precise and the stunt work was also so precise — where exactly everything had to hit you and snap your neck back. Weirdly, sometimes the bigger, more emotional things for the audience are the more technical things for us.  Foster: I’ve had a lot of experience with that making movies. Whether it’s a movie like Contact or others where you’re doing these really emotional things and they also happen to be in the most persnickety moments of the film. Where it’s 120 takes later and you’re acting to a green screen and it’s a challenge. The challenge of a film like this is that it feels like an indie movie but in fact, it still is very orchestrated.  DeWitt: And I will say, I was very lucky as a performer because Jodie had done that as an actor and she had thought about that going in. We didn’t have the budget for 100 takes of anything, but Jodie would almost walk through it and know where the pitfalls were before we even got to it. Otherwise, we actually wouldn’t have been able to do it.  Foster: The greatest joy I have as a director is watching actors give so much. I always try to prepare as much as possible so that when they get there, I’m ready! I’m ready to capture and it all goes very fast.  How long did you have to film that scene?  Foster: I don’t even think we got a full day for that. It was a half day.  When did you film the episode and how long was the shoot?    DeWitt: We were shooting in November, including during Election Day.  Foster: I think we filmed for three weeks, about 18 days. We filmed it in Toronto.  What was set like on Election Day?  Foster: We were all filling out our Canada defection forms. (Laughs.) The next day was the second day of shooting and we actually shot the end scene where Marie runs out of the house all bloody.  DeWitt: For the scene, I kept having to hit my phone saying, “No! No! No!” once Sara leaves, and that’s what I had done while laying in bed as the results were coming in. So there was no acting there.  Was that therapeutic?  DeWitt: I would say it informed the scene. If anything, Jodie used the restrained version. I think I was doing some Sylvester Stallone “Adrian!” or Marlon Brando “Stella!”-type screaming in the versions that didn't make the final cut (laughs).  The overall palette of the episode — how dreary and drab things were, especially the clothes — stood out. Usually, Black Mirror episodes are modern, but here not much technology was even used aside from the ArkAngel. What kind of world were you trying to create?  Foster: That was a choice that I wanted to make. I said, “What is America in the immediate future? Where is America going to be five years from now, or less?” I felt that some of what informed this mom’s life is that she was from this hard-scrabbled American town that had died. It was a town where there’s no opportunity. Everything had been closed, the infrastructure hadn’t been fixed. Nobody cared about them. She had a tough, working-class life, like in a Detroit suburb or Pittsburgh or something, and this beautiful, little, perfect kid is this light. That informed how she lived vicariously through her and why she wanted to keep her safe. Her world had been disappointing and she had been a disappointment. I love how [Charlie Brooker and executive producer Annabel Jones] support the artist because they did ask me those questions. They definitely were aware that these were choices we were making to reflect America, that this is America and not a clean, modern version of the future in England, for example.  You’ve directed episodes of Netflix's Orange Is the New Black and House of Cards, but this episode makes you the first female director of Black Mirror, which now has a total 19 episodes.  Foster: Is that right? It’s funny. That seems like a big deal, but it’s not really unusual because there aren’t that many female directors. It’s changing now, and especially in television it’s changed quite a bit in the last few years. But I’ve made, I don’t know, 55 movies and I’ve only worked with a female director once in my whole life.  As an actor, how appealing was it to have a female director, especially for this story?  DeWitt: Working with Jodie as a talented director was super enticing to me and just hearing you two now talking about it, if it had been a male director, I don’t think I would have been able to lean into it as much. So much of our journey through this was identifying the ways we related to the story as mothers, which way we related to the story as daughters and thinking of our personal mothers. There’s not a lot of dialogue, so we had to rely a lot on, “You know that feeling when…” and “You know that moment when…”. It would have been a different conversation with a male director. I wanted to be directed by Jodie Foster in particular, but in terms of this story, I’m so glad it was a woman. And a single mom is a different dynamic, in terms of the placeholder; who they are to each other and what they stand in for is sometimes not just mother and child.  After Marie emerges alive and bloody from the fight, viewers see Sara hitchhiking out of town and the screen turns to black. How do you each envision their lives going from here? Where do you imagine them years from now?  Foster: I think the question mark is really wonderful. You witness the last part of this fable; that the mother had this fear that she had from before the movie started, this fear of being abandoned by her child. Of not being able to find her. It was an irrational, crazy paranoid fear and you could recognize there was something not quite right about it. And yet, she created this final moment. She made it happen. She created it out of a desperation that forced her daughter to abandon her and into the arms of potentially exactly what she feared, which is not safety. That shutting of the door where the truck slams and it goes to black is the big question mark: Is Sara going to be in a ditch? Will she be raped by the side of the road? Will she be safe? Those are the questions that we have as parents.  DeWitt: Also, now I’ve lost her. She is lost to the mother, it seems like, forever.  Foster: Whether that is metaphorically or physically so, she is lost. They will never have that relationship again. That relationship is over, as it should be. We have now witnessed birth to individuation; that is a cycle of life and that’s why it ends on that hard black.  Given the current climate and the spotlight on how women in Hollywood have been treated, are you two more selective with who you work with at this point in your careers?  Foster: I aspire to be able to appreciate and review a director based on their accomplishments and based on who they are and what they bring to the material, regardless of their gender. That’s what we’re all hoping for. My favorite feminist director was Jonathan Demme [Silence of the Lambs, Rachel Getting Married].  DeWitt: Mine too.  Foster: I’ve worked with a lot of amazing gentlemen in this business, and they were my dads. They took me into their wing and believed in me. They gave me opportunities and chances and I learned from them. That’s a part of my legacy. That’s a part of how I was raised in this business, by these wonderful men who educated me. They are a part of my story. Times have changed. The one area in the filmmaking business that hasn’t changed very much is for women, but I think that is changing now. It’s especially changing on streaming and cable. Now that viewing habits have changed and people don’t go to the movies so often anymore.  DeWitt: It is changing. Like always, there is a lot more work to be done. And it does feel like stories about women tend to happen during times like these — we’re on a spiral in a linear sense and whether it be an Olive Kitteridge or an episode of Black Mirror, sometimes it takes different times to tell all different kinds of stories. But I’m so grateful when they’re 3D and complex and when we’re swimming in the deep water, which I feel like we got to do on this one.  The fourth season of Black Mirror is streaming now on Netflix.

Anastasia Steele: Um, he was really polite, and he was courteous, and very formal and clean.  Kate: Clean?  Anastasia Steele: I mean, he was very, you know, smart and intense. It was kind of intimidating. I can understand the fascination.  Kate: Uh-huh!  Anastasia Steele: Why are you looking at me like that?  Kate: Like what?  Anastasia Steele: Okay.  Anastasia Steele: I’m going to make a sandwich, do you want one?  Kate: No, thanks.  [looking at Christian’s photos on her laptop]  Kate: You have to admit, he’s ridiculously hot.  Anastasia Steele: I’m sure if you are attracted to that sort of human, then…  Kate: The hot type of human?  Anastasia Steele: I asked him if he was gay, that was in your questions. Why would you do that to me?  Kate: Because whenever he’s in the society pages, he’s never been photographed with a woman. So naturally…  Anastasia Steele: Well maybe he just wants to keep his private life private, Kate.  Kate: And now you’re defending him.  Anastasia Steele: I’m terminating this conversation.  Kate: Too bad we don’t have some original stills of your hot, clean, twenty-seven year old billionaire. The camera loves him almost as much as you do.  [Ana gives her a disapproving look]  Kate: Okay, I wasn’t hungry, but now I am.  [Kate takes the sandwich that Ana had just made]  Kate: Thank you.  [she bites into the sandwich]  Kate: I love you.

[Ana hugs Jose]  Anastasia Steele: Congratulations, that’s so good!  Anastasia Steele: Can we celebrate later? Cause I’m really late for work.  Jose: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got it, you got it.  [as Ana goes to open her car door]  Jose: Hold on. Hold on, hold on.  [Jose opens the car door for Ana]  Anastasia Steele: Thank you, you’re my hero.  [Ana gets into her car]  Jose: See you later.  Anastasia Steele: Okay.  [Jose waves goodbye to Ana as she drives off]  [Ana is at work at a hardware store when she gets a call from her mother, Carla]  Anastasia Steele: Mom, I’m at work can I call you back?  Carla: Oh, no, wait. Wait, wait. I called for a reason. Bob broke his foot playing golf of all things.  Anastasia Steele: God, is he okay? Is he in a lot of pain?  Carla: Who can tell? The man calls the paramedics for a blister. It means though, we won’t be able to fly in for graduation.  Anastasia Steele: Really? I mean, you don’t want to just come alone? You don’t have to bring Bob.  Carla: And leave Tiger Woods to fend for himself? You understand, don’t you, darling?  [Ana looks visibly upset]  Anastasia Steele: Yeah. Yeah, it’s fine. I really have to go, okay?  Carla: I love you, Ana.  Anastasia Steele: I know. I love you too.  [Ana ends the call]  Anastasia Steele: God.  [Ana’s manager, Paul, comes over to her]  Paul Clayton: Ana, could you give me a hand out back?  Anastasia Steele: Uh, yeah, yeah. I’ll be right there.  [as Ana walks by an aisle she’s suddenly startled to find Christian standing there]  Christian Grey: I thought it was you.  Anastasia Steele: What the…?  Christian Grey: What a pleasant surprise, Miss Steele.  Anastasia Steele: Just Ana. Just Ana. You’re in here.  Christian Grey: I was in the area on business, needed to pick up a few things. Are you free?  Anastasia Steele: Yeah. What can I help you with?  Christian Grey: Do you stock cable ties?  Anastasia Steele: Cable ties, yes, we do. I can show you, if you want.  Christian Grey: Please, lead the way, Miss Steele.  Anastasia Steele: Just Ana.  [Ana takes Christian to the cable ties]  Anastasia Steele: Is that it?  Christian Grey: Masking tape.  Anastasia Steele: Are you redecorating?  [Ana takes Christian to the masking tapes]  Christian Grey: No.  Anastasia Steele: Um, we have two inch and one inch. But the truly self-respecting handyman will have both in his tool box.  Christian Grey: Of course he will.  Anastasia Steele: It’s rare to find a connoisseur these days. Do you want anything else?  Christian Grey: Yes, rope.  [as Ana is getting Christian some rope]  Christian Grey: That’s impressive. Are you a girl scout?  Anastasia Steele: Um, no. Organized group activities aren’t really my thing.  Christian Grey: So what is your thing?  Anastasia Steele: Um, I don’t know. Books?  [Ana chuckles]  Anastasia Steele: Okay. Rope, tape, cable ties. You’re the complete serial killer.  Christian Grey: Not today.  Anastasia Steele: Anything else?  Christian Grey: What would you recommend?  Anastasia Steele: For a do-it-yourselfer? Um, maybe coveralls so you protect your clothes?  Christian Grey: I could just take all my clothes off.  Anastasia Steele: Okay, no clothes. I mean, no coveralls. You, I can’t really think of anything else.  Christian Grey: Well, I guess that’s it then.  Anastasia Steele: Cool.  [at the cash register Ana bags up Christian’s things]  Anastasia Steele: Thank you for answering Kate’s questions by the way, she was thrilled.  Christian Grey: Well I hope she’s feeling better.  Anastasia Steele: She is, yeah, much. She’s just having a hard time clearing a photo of you.  Christian Grey: If she’d like an original, I’m around tomorrow.  Anastasia Steele: You’d be willing to do that?  Christian Grey: Yeah.  [just then Paul comes up behind Ana and puts his hands on her shoulders]  Paul Clayton: Want me to bag for you, Ana?  Anastasia Steele: Oh. Uh, no, no, no. I’m good. Thanks though, Paul.  [Christian gives Paul a cold look and Paul walks away]  Anastasia Steele: Okay.  [Christian places his business card on the counter]  Christian Grey: I’m staying locally at the Heathman. Call me before ten.  [Ana looks at him confused]  Christian Grey: About the photos.  Anastasia Steele: Oh. Yeah, I will.  [Ana takes the business card]  Anastasia Steele: Enjoy your…  [Christian turns and leave the shop, Ana watches him through the window as he gives his bag to his driver, Taylor, and get into his car]  [Jose is taking pictures of Christian as Kate and Ana watch from the side]  Kate: Thanks again for doing this, Mr. Grey.  Christian Grey: I’m happy to help.  [to Christian]  Jose: Uh, how about if we try a few with a smile?  [Jose takes more photos but Christian still doesn’t smile]  Jose: Or not.  [as they watch Christian being photographed]  Kate: You do realize that he hasn’t stopped looking at you?  Anastasia Steele: He asked me to go for coffee afterwards.  Kate: What?  [Kate starts to laugh]  Anastasia Steele: Kate, shh.  [after the photo shoot, as they walk down the hotel corridor]  Christian Grey: So is he your boyfriend?  Anastasia Steele: Who?  Christian Grey: The photographer.  [Ana laughs]  Anastasia Steele: Jose? No.  Christian Grey: I saw the way he was smiling at you.  Anastasia Steele: No, Jose is more like family. He’s not my boyfriend.  Christian Grey: And the guy at the store?  [looking at Christian with shock]  Anastasia Steele: Paul? No.  [Ana and Christian are sat at the coffee shop, Christian pours Ana some tea]  Anastasia Steele: Thank you.  Christian Grey: You seem nervous.  Anastasia Steele: I find you intimidating.  Christian Grey: You should.  [he places a muffin in front of Ana]  Christian Grey: Eat.  Anastasia Steele: Not to mention high-handed.  Christian Grey: I’m used to getting my own way.  Anastasia Steele: Well it must get very boring.  Christian Grey: Tell me about your family.  Anastasia Steele: My family? Um, okay. My dad died when I was a baby, so I was raised by my step-father Ray. He’s amazing.  Christian Grey: And your mother?  Anastasia Steele: Um, my mother is on husband number four. She’s an incurable romantic.  Christian Grey: And you?  Anastasia Steele: Am I a romantic?  [Christian nods his head]  Anastasia Steele: Well I study English Lit, so I kind of have to be.  Anastasia Steele: Thought the photo shoot went well. Right? Kate seems to be really happy…  Christian Grey: I’m sorry, I can’t.  Anastasia Steele: What?  Christian Grey: I’ll walk you out.  [Christian gets up; outside Christians walks beside Ana]  Anastasia Steele: Do you have a girlfriend, is that it?  Christian Grey: I don’t do the girlfriend thing.  Anastasia Steele: What does that even mean?  [as they go to cross the street Ana is almost hit by a biker when suddenly Christian pulls her out of the way]  Christian Grey: Watch it!  [he holds onto Ana and touches her face tenderly]  Christian Grey: I’m not the man for you. You should steer clear of me. I have to let you go.  [Ana clearly looks hurt]  Anastasia Steele: Goodbye, Mr. Grey.  [Ana walks away]  [after finishing their final exam Kate goes over to Ana]  Kate: Hey, you all good?  Anastasia Steele: Yeah, why wouldn’t I be?  Kate: We are so partying tonight.  [Ana chuckles]  Anastasia Steele: Oh, my God.  [later Kate helps Ana put makeup on her face]  Anastasia Steele: This is way too much. You’re getting it…  Kate: No, this is exactly the right amount.  Anastasia Steele: All over my face?  Kate: That’s the idea.  [Ana looks in the mirror]  Anastasia Steele: Wow. No, Kate.  [just then their doorbell rings]  Kate: Cab’s early. Let’s go.  Kate: Ana, there’s a package for you.  [Kate reads the note on the package]  Kate: “Why didn’t you tell me there was danger? Why didn’t you warn me? Ladies know what to guard against because…  Kate, Ana: …they read novels that tells them of these tricks.”  Anastasia Steele: That’s a quote from Tess of the d’Urbervilles.  [Ana opens the package to find three books]  Anastasia Steele: Oh, my God. These must be from Christian.  [Ana opens one book]  Anastasia Steele: Do you…? I mean these are incredible.  Kate: Wow, great.  Anastasia Steele: Kate, these are first editions. I can’t, this is too much. I can’t accept these, I have to send them back.  [they hear a car honking its horn]  Kate: That’s the cab. Okay, are you ready?  Anastasia Steele: Yes.  Kate: Are you really though?  Anastasia Steele: Yes, very.  Kate: Let’s get out of here.  [later at the club after drinking a shot; to Ana]  Kate: Did you do it all?  [Ana shakes her head]  Jose: Alright! With my right eye closed and left handed, I can get this in. Ready? One, two…  [Ana turns to go]  Kate: What?  Anastasia Steele: I got to pee.  Kate: Okay.  Jose: Where you going?  Anastasia Steele: I got to go. I got to pee.  [Ana gets up and leaves]  [standing in line for the ladies a drunk Ana decides to call Christian]  Christian Grey: Anastasia?  Anastasia Steele: Yeah, this is me. I’m sending back your expensive books, cause I already have copies of those. Thanks though for the kind gesture.  Christian Grey: You’re welcome. Where are you?  Anastasia Steele: Oh, I’m in line, cause I have to pee really bad.  Christian Grey: Anastasia, have you been drinking?  [Ana chuckles]  Anastasia Steele: Yeah, I have, Mr. Fancy Pants. You hit the hail, hail on the nead. I mean the head on the nail.  Christian Grey: Listen to me, I want you to go home right now.  Anastasia Steele: You’re so bossy!  [doing a mocking impression of Christian’s voice]  Anastasia Steele: Ana, let’s go for coffee. Ana, let’s go for coffee. No, stay away from me, Ana. I don’t want you. Get away. Come here, come here. Go away.  Christian Grey: That’s it. Tell me where you are.  Anastasia Steele: A long way from Seattle. Long way from you.  Christian Grey: Which bar, what’s it called?  Anastasia Steele: I don’t know, I got to go though.  Christian Grey: Which bar, Ana?  [Ana ends the call; to the girl next to her in line]  Anastasia Steele: I told him, right?  [Christian calls Ana back]  Anastasia Steele: I’m sorry I didn’t mean…  Christian Grey: Stay where you are, I’m coming to get you.  Anastasia Steele: What?  [Christian ends the call]  Anastasia Steele: Hello?  [Ana goes outside the club and Jose finds her]  Jose: Hey.  [he puts her jacket on her]  Anastasia Steele: Oh, thanks.  Jose: You okay?  Anastasia Steele: Yeah, I’m just feeling a little more drunk than…  [Jose chuckles when she can’t finish her sentence]  Jose: Come here stay warm.  [Jose pulls Ana close into his arms]  Anastasia Steele: Oh, that’s cool. I’m good, Jose. I got it.  [Ana tries to pull away]  Jose: I don’t know when I’ll have the courage to do this.

Christian Grey: I’ll have Elliot tell her.  Anastasia Steele: Who’s Elliot?  Christian Grey: He’s my brother. He’s inside talking to her right now.  Anastasia Steele: How, I don’t…?  Christian Grey: He’s at my hotel with me.  Anastasia Steele: You’re still at the Heathman?  Christian Grey: Yeah. Come.  [back inside the club, Kate is dancing with Elliot, Ana watches as Christian goes over to Elliot to speak with him for a moment before heading back to her]  Anastasia Steele: That’s your brother?  Christian Grey: Not by choice. Let’s go.  Anastasia Steele: Wait what did Kate say?  Christian Grey: She warned me to be on my best behavior. More like threatened me.  [Ana laughs]  Anastasia Steele: She threatened you?  [Ana looks at Christian]  Anastasia Steele: You’re spinning. I think I’m going to faint.  Christian Grey: What, now?

Anastasia Steele: Where did you sleep?  [he points to the space next to her in bed]  Anastasia Steele: Oh, my God. Did we…? We didn’t…?  Christian Grey: Necrophilia is not my thing.  Anastasia Steele: So we just slept then?  Christian Grey: It was a novelty for me too.  [Christian goes over to her and gives her some toast]  Christian Grey: You need to eat. I had Taylor pick you up some clothes.  Anastasia Steele: Who’s Taylor?  Christian Grey: My driver.  Anastasia Steele: Thank you, but you didn’t have to do that.  Christian Grey: Yes, I did. Yours were covered in vomit. You shouldn’t get drunk like that. I’m all for testing the limits, but you put yourself at risk last night.  Anastasia Steele: I know.  [Christian takes off his t-shirt]  Christian Grey: If you were mine you wouldn’t be able to sit down for a week.  [Christian goes over to her and sits opposite it her on the bed]  Anastasia Steele: What?  [Christian takes a bite out of her toast]  Christian Grey: I got to go take a shower.

Anastasia Steele: Then don’t. Why did you send me those books?  Christian Grey: I thought I owed you an apology.  Anastasia Steele: For what? For letting you believe that I… Listen to me.  [he sits next to her on the bed]  Christian Grey: I don’t do romance. My tastes are very singular. You wouldn’t understand.  Anastasia Steele: Enlighten me then.

Anastasia Steele: Taylor has good taste.  Christian Grey: What are you doing later?  Anastasia Steele: I’m working at the hardware store till seven.

Elliot Grey: Hi, you must be Ana.  [they shake hands]  Anastasia Steele: You must be Elliot.  Elliot Grey: And we must be going, Elliot.  [to Ana]  Elliot Grey: So awesome to meet you. Kate’s told me a lot about you.  Christian Grey: Elliot, find your shoes. Some of us have work to attend to.  Elliot Grey: What are you doing with Mr. Warmth here, I have no idea.  [Ana smiles]  [Ana and Christian watch uncomfortably as Elliot kisses Kate goodbye]  Elliot Grey: Laters, baby.  [Elliot walks out of the apartment; to Ana]  Christian Grey: I’ll see you tonight.

[Christian leaves]  Anastasia Steele: Elliot seems really nice.  [Ana laughs]  Kate: No, no. We’re starting with you. If you’re seeing him again tonight, that means that something happened. Ana?  [Ana avoids answering and starts to walk away]  Anastasia Steele: I have to get ready for work.  [they both laugh]  Anastasia Steele: We just kissed. Once.  Kate: Only once? That’s odd.  Anastasia Steele: Mm. Odd doesn’t even cover it.  Kate: Uh-huh.  [Ana turns and starts walking to her room]  Kate: And a new jacket. Hm.  [after finishing work, Ana walks out of the store to see Taylor waiting for her]  Anastasia Steele: Hi. It’s Taylor, right?  Taylor: Good evening, Miss Steele. Mr. Grey will be joining us there.

[Ana chuckles to herself]  Anastasia Steele: Of course you do.  [referring to the piece of paper on the table]  Anastasia Steele: What’s this?  Christian Grey: It’s a non-disclosure agreement. It means that you cannot discuss anything about us with anyone. I’m afraid my lawyer insists on it.  Anastasia Steele: I’d never talk to anyone about us anyway.  [Ana signs the agreement]  Anastasia Steele: Are you going to make love to me now?  Christian Grey: Two things: First, I don’t make love. I fuck, hard.  Anastasia Steele: And the second thing?

Christian Grey: My playroom.  Anastasia Steele: Like your Xbox and stuff?  Christian Grey: It’s important that you know that you can leave at any time.  Anastasia Steele: Why? What’s in there?  Christian Grey: I meant what I said. The helicopter is on standby to take you whenever you want to go.  Anastasia Steele: Christian, just open the door.  [he unlocks the door, as they step inside Ana is visibly shocked at what she sees]  Anastasia Steele: Oh, my God.

[Ana walks silently to touch another item]  Christian Grey: Say something, please.  Anastasia Steele: Do women do this to you or do you…?  Christian Grey: I do this to women. With women. Women who want me to.  Anastasia Steele: You’re a sadist?  Christian Grey: I’m a dominant.  Anastasia Steele: What does that mean?  Christian Grey: It means I want you to willingly surrender yourself to me.  Anastasia Steele: Why would I do that?  Christian Grey: To please me.  Anastasia Steele: To please you? How?  Christian Grey: I have rules, if you follow them, I’ll reward you. If you don’t, I’ll punish you.  Anastasia Steele: You’d punish me, like you’d use this stuff on me?  Christian Grey: Yes.  Anastasia Steele: What would I get out of this?  Christian Grey: Me.  [Christian escorts Ana to another room]  Christian Grey: If we were to do this, this would be your room. You can decorate it however you like.  Anastasia Steele: You want me to move in?  Christian Grey: Not full-time, just Friday through to Sunday. We can negotiate the particulars.  Anastasia Steele: So, I, so, I’d sleep in here with you?  Christian Grey: No, I’d be downstairs. I told you I don’t sleep with anyone.  [Christian escorts Ana downstairs]  Anastasia Steele: What if I don’t want anything to do with that?  Christian Grey: I would understand completely.  Anastasia Steele: But then we wouldn’t have any sort of relationship at all?  Christian Grey: This is the only sort of relationship I have.  Anastasia Steele: Why?  Christian Grey: It’s the way I am.  Anastasia Steele: When you said negotiate, what did you mean?  Christian Grey: I already have a contract prepared. It’s fairly detailed. You would review it and we would negotiate what you are and are not willing to try.  Anastasia Steele: How could I know what I’d be willing to try?  Christian Grey: Well when you’ve had sex, was there anything you didn’t like doing? We have to be honest with each other for this to work, okay?  [Ana down in embarrassment]  Anastasia Steele: I wouldn’t know.  Christian Grey: What do you mean?  Anastasia Steele: Because I haven’t, I haven’t…  Christian Grey: You’re still a virgin? I’ve just shown you…  Anastasia Steele: I know, I just…  Christian Grey: You’ve done other things, right?  Anastasia Steele: No.  [Christian touches her face tenderly]  Christian Grey: Where have you been?  Anastasia Steele: Waiting.  Christian Grey: Men must throw themselves at you.  Anastasia Steele: Never what I’ve wanted.  [Ana looks down, biting on her lip]  Christian Grey: You’re biting your lip.  [he kisses her]  Anastasia Steele: What are you doing?  Christian Grey: Rectifying the situation.  Anastasia Steele: I’m a situation?  [he takes Ana to his bedroom, slowly undresses, kisses her and proceeds to have sex with her; later Ana wakes when she hears Christian playing the piano downstairs, Ana goes over to him, they start kissing, he picks her up and takes her back to the bedroom]  [the next morning Christian walks in on Ana dancing as she fixes breakfast, startling her]  Christian Grey: You’re energetic this morning.  Anastasia Steele: You hungry?  Christian Grey: Very.  [Ana smiles]  Anastasia Steele: Cause I’m making pancakes.

[Christian moves down her body again]  Christian Grey: Say yes.  Anastasia Steele: To what?  Christian Grey: To being mine.  [just as he’s about to go down on her Christian’s adoptive mother, Grace, calls out]  Mrs. Grey: Christian!  Christian Grey: Shit. It’s my mother.  [Ana starts to laugh as Christian starts to untie her wrists]  Anastasia Steele: I’m naked.  Christian Grey: Get dressed.  [downstairs in Christian’s apartment Taylor is with Mrs. Grey]  Mrs. Grey: Taylor, there’s no need to show me around. And there’s no need to hover.  Taylor: He’s still sleeping, Dr. Grey.  Mrs. Grey: He’s still sleeping? But he never sleeps in. Certainly not at this hour. Unless of course he’s ill is he?  [just then Christian walks in]  Mrs. Grey: Ah.  Taylor: Sorry, Mr. Grey.  Christian Grey: It’s fine, I know how she can be.  [he kisses Mrs. Grey’s cheeks]  Mrs. Grey: She? Oh, well if you’re trying to avoid me, the very least you can do is call me by my correct name, which would be “mama.”  [Ana joins Mrs. Grey and Christian]  Anastasia Steele: Hi.  Mrs. Grey: Oh, dear God.  Christian Grey: Mother, Anastasia Steele. Ana, meet my mother. Dr. Grace Trevelyan Grey.  [Ana and Mrs. Grey shake hands]  Mrs. Grey: You have no idea how delighted I am to meet you.  Anastasia Steele: It’s nice to meet you too, Dr. Grey.  Mrs. Grey: Grace. She’s very pretty. You are very pretty.  Anastasia Steele: Thank you.  Christian Grey: What happened to calling before dropping by?  Mrs. Grey: Oh, and have your henchman give me the run around? No, thank you. I’ll take my chances. Well, I was in the neighborhood and I thought perhaps we could have lunch.  Christian Grey: I can’t today, I have to drive Ana home.

[Christian kisses Mrs. Grey goodbye as she steps into the elevator with Taylor]  Mrs. Grey: Thank you.  [upstairs Ana talks on the phone with Kate]  Anastasia Steele: I can’t talk about it right now, Kate.  [she walks into the bedroom he showed her last night]  Anastasia Steele: I got to go. I’ll call you back, okay?  [Ana ends the call, walks into the room and sits on the bed]  Christian Grey: Everything okay with the phone call?  Anastasia Steele: Yeah, nothing important. I liked your mom.  Christian Grey: She’s excited. She’s never seen me with a woman before. You’re the first.  Christian Grey: What is it Ana?  Anastasia Steele: Um, I just, how many women have stayed in here?  Christian Grey: Fifteen.  Anastasia Steele: That’s a lot of women.  Christian Grey: I told you before, if you want out…  Anastasia Steele: I don’t want out. I’m just, I’m not exactly jumping at the opportunity to get whipped and tortured in your red room of pain.  Christian Grey: The room is much more about pleasure. I promise you.  Anastasia Steele: Would we still go out to dinner, and movies and…?  Christian Grey: That’s not really my thing. Try to keep an open mind.  Christian Grey: If you agree to be my submissive, I will be devoted to you. This is what I want. I want it with you.  Anastasia Steele: Why do I have to sleep in here? We slept in the same bed last night, like normal people.  Christian Grey: Try not to get hung up on the sleeping arrangements. If you agree to do this, you’re going to want your own room.  Anastasia Steele: Why, cause I’ll be your sex slave?  Christian Grey: I don’t want to do this here, let’s talk downstairs.  Anastasia Steele: No. You know what, I think I’ll hold on to my freewill a little while longer, thank you. Actually, you know what? I would like to go home, can I go home?  [referring to the cars as they walk through the basement car park]  Anastasia Steele: Which one’s yours?  Christian Grey: All of them.  [Christian drives them to the woods and wakes up Ana from her nap]  Christian Grey: Let’s go for a walk.  [as they walk in the woods]  Anastasia Steele: How did you start doing this?  Christian Grey: One of my mother’s friends. I was fifteen.  Anastasia Steele: She seduced you?  Christian Grey: I was her submissive for six years.  Anastasia Steele: Seriously? Does your mother know that?  Christian Grey: Of course not. No one in my family knows about this part of me.  Anastasia Steele: So she introduced you to all this? Mrs. Robinson?  Christian Grey: Mrs. Robinson. I’ll tell her you said that, she’ll love it.  Anastasia Steele: You still talk to her?  Christian Grey: On occasions. We’re friends.  Total Quotes: 127",real
19657,"There's a new queen of the ""NCIS"" lab.  On Wednesday, CBS announced that recurring guest star Diona Reasonover will join the cast full time as the new forensic scientist in Season 16, which went into production this week. She replaces original cast member Pauley Perrette, who left the series in May.  Reasonover, 26, made her debut as Kasie Hines, a grad student and trained forensic scientist that medical examiner Dr. Donald ""Ducky"" (David McCallum) met while teaching in New York, in a three-episode guest arc that began in March. Though he originally hired her to serve an assistant for a book project about past cases, he ended up bringing her back to Washington when one of those cases was reopened. After Abby (Perrette) resigned, Gibbs (Mark Harmon) hired her as a temporary replacement. That deal has now been made permanent.  Reasonover's acting credits include Amazon's ""Transparent"" and the TBS barbershop comedy ""Clipped"" and Hulu's ""Future Man."" She was also a writer on Hulu's Emmy-nominated political travelogue ""I Love You America,"" starring Sarah Silverman, and TruTV's ""Adam Ruins Everything.""  The Detroit native studied at Oberlin College in Ohio and trained with improv groups like Second City Hollywood and Upright Citizens Brigade, where she impersonated Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, two ""Real Housewives"" of Atlanta and one of her show-biz idols, Whoopi Goldberg.  Reasonover's casting comes two months after Perrette claimed that the network had silenced her from explaining the exact reason for leaving after 15 years, hinting that a crime was involved. She also said that ""multiple physical assaults"" had taken place but didn't directly tie them to the show or network.  In a series of tweets, Perrette said had been trying to protect the show's crew and their jobs, referred to false stories being spread about her and blamed a ""very powerful publicity 'machine' "" for keeping her silent.  CBS Television Studios later said had worked with Perrette to rectify an unspecified set ""concern"" she brought last year.  ""Pauley Perrette had a terrific run on NCIS and we are all going to miss her,"" the statement read. ""Over a year ago, Pauley came to us with a workplace concern. We took the matter seriously and worked with her to find a resolution. We are committed to a safe work environment on all our shows.""

4475,"They needed permission to marry.  Prince Harry also needed the queen's permission to marry Meghan Markle. WPA Pool/Getty Images  William had to ask his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, for her consent to marry Kate, according to the Royal Marriages Act 1772, which decrees all descendants of George II must obtain the sovereign’s agreement before they wed, otherwise the marriage is invalid.  In 2013, the traditional Royal Marriages Act was repealed in favor of the Successions to the Crown Act—meaning only the first six in line to the throne require the Queen's permission to marry. William is second in line, so he needs Her Majesty's permission, which she happily gave.

2459,"|  Angelina Jolie is calling off her divorce from Brad Pitt, according to a shocking story from Globe. The magazine reports she's ready to reunite with her estranged husband out of desperation.  In the wake of a judge warning Jolie she could lose physical custody of their kids if she doesn't facilitate a better relationship between the children and their father, the outlet explains the actress believes the only way to keep full custody of her kids is to get back together with Pitt and stop their divorce proceedings. ""She's doing her best to mend her fractured relationship with Brad and become a family again,"" reveals an insider.  But while the publication describes Jolie as ""blindsided"" by the judge's ruling and in a panic over future access to her kids, the actress has been carrying on just fine. She recently went on a humanitarian trip to Iraq, has been filming Maleficent 2, and even took her children to Wicked on London's West End. Gossip Cop can also confirm she's made no effort towards reconciling with Pitt.  It should also be noted that this same tabloid falsely claimed Jolie and Pitt were getting back together in June. In that version of the narrative, their supposed reunion had nothing to do with avoiding custody issues, but was because they were allegedly still in love with each other. The truth then and now is that the divorce is still very much on.",fake
10300,"Violetta Komyshan has revealed how she and her boyfriend Ansel Elgort met back in high school—and it all began with a slight misunderstanding.  The ballerina, 21, met the Baby Driver star, who is now 23, back when both of them were students at Fiorello H. LaGuardia School. Located in New York City, the school is famous for its performing arts program, which has clearly benefited Violetta and her beau.  Ansel and Violetta's romance began when Violetta, unaware that Ansel went to the same school as her, spotted the budding actor and immediately noticed his good looks.  Memories: Violetta Komyshan has revealed how she and her boyfriend Ansel Elgort met back in high school, when both of them were attending Fiorello H. LaGuardia School  Past: The ballerina, 21, met the Baby Driver star, who is now 23, back when both of them were students at the New York City school, which is famous for its performing arts program  'I think he had his eye on me, because we were in the same lunch period or something,' she told Cosmopolitan in a new interview.  '[One day freshman year] I was with my friend, and he was walking down the block. I didn't even know he went to my school—I just thought he was really attractive.'  Luckily, a friend of Violetta's was there to tell her more about the mysterious stranger.  'I looked at him and told my friend, ""Oh my God, that guy's so hot,"" and she's like, ""Oh that's Ansel, he goes to LaGuardia,""' Violetta added.  'Then he walked up to us and said, ""What's good?"" and [mimes a fist bump]. I thought he liked her!'  Although she was originally convinced Ansel was on his way to developing a crush on her friend, the actor's behavior made it clear he was in fact interested in getting to know Violetta better.  'He waited for me [after school] the next day and told our friend to introduce us and I was like, ""OK, he totally liked me yesterday,""' the ballerina said.  'Then I made her come with us to Starbucks. We exchanged numbers and became friends, and then we started dating when I was at the end of sophomore year.'  Origin story: Ansel and Violetta's romance began when Violetta (pictured with Ansel last month in Sydney, Australia), spotted the budding actor and noticed his good looks  Duo: Violetta (pictured in an Instagram snap taken behind the scenes while Ansel was shooting Baby Driver) first thought the actor had a crush on her friend  It worked out: But Ansel waited for her after school the next day, and Violetta realized he was, in fact, interested in getting to know her better  Being the girlfriend of a high-profile actor means Violetta sometimes has to deal with abusive comments from some of his fans, especially on social media. The dancer has an impressive 838,000 followers on Instagram.  Violetta, who said she occasionally gets comments such as 'You're ugly', doesn't pay them much attention.  'There's no substance to those little comments they make,' she said. 'Sometimes they'll insult what I'm wearing or something, but who cares? It's fashion, whatever. I just stay away from that.'  Nowadays, Violetta says she get much more positive feedback than negative remarks, with plenty of social media users gushing over how cute the couple is.  The social media star also revealed that Ansel, the son of the American fashion photographer Arthur Elgort, is behind a lot of the pictures that have appeared on her feed.  'He takes a lot of my photos,' she said. 'He really knows when I look genuinely happy and beautiful. His dad's a photographer, and [Ansel] really learned how to use a camera growing up. He knows my light, he knows everything. He could just be my personal photographer and he'd be great at it because he's so good.'  Snaps: Violetta and Ansel regularly share pictures of themselves together on social media, and sometimes write cute messages for their significant other on their own platforms  Backlash: Being the girlfriend of a high-profile actor means Violetta sometimes has to deal with abusive comments from some of his fans, especially on social media  Handling it: But nowadays, Violetta (pictured with Ansel at a basketball game last year in New York City) says she get much more positive feedback than negative remarks  Violetta and Ansel regularly share pictures of themselves together on social media, and sometimes write cute messages for their significant other on their own platforms.  Last month, Ansel posted a couple of photos of his girlfriend, pointing out in the caption that he's been 'obsessed with her since high school'. The post remains one of Violetta's favorites.  'I was like, ""Awww."" Which is true, we've been together like six years!' she added.  The dancer and social media sensation also admitted to editing her photos before she posts them, and revealed she loves the app VSCO for that purpose.  'Sometimes if I have too many pimples or something—we all have problems with our skin sometimes—I'll edit that out, but only if it's really visible,' she said.  'I love pretty photos, that's it—so if a filter makes it prettier, I'll do it. I'll brighten it a little just to make it pop more—make the sky more blue or make the grass more green.'",real

13328,"Get ready to go Overboard — again. This Friday, Anna Faris and Eugenio Derbez are steering the beloved 1987 comedy in a new direction, with Faris playing Kate Sullivan, an exhausted, debt-ridden mom of three, and Derbez hitting the decks as spoiled playboy Leonardo Montenegro.  Two months after Derbez, 56, presented at the Oscars (“It was a huge dream come true”), USA TODAY chatted with world-famous star about taking on the Goldie Hawn classic — and why he left Mexico City for Hollywood, where films like Overboard and How to Be a Latin Lover awaited.  Question: You produced and star in this film. Why remake Overboard, of all '80s comedies?  Eugenio Derbez: I’ve been working my entire life in Mexico City, and working for the Hispanic market. But after I did a 2013 movie called Instructions Not Included, it became a hit in the U.S. and a lot of doors opened in Hollywood, so I started having meetings with the studios. When I went to MGM, they wanted to do something with me, and they said, ""Are you interested in doing remakes?"" I said, ""I could be."" And they gave me the list of remakes (they owned), and when I saw Overboard I was really excited, because I grew up watching the film. Goldie Hawn was my movie-star crush when I was young.  Q: Your Overboard steers clear of stereotyping its Latino characters. What's your take on why modern comedies rely on such tired tropes?  Derbez: When I started coming to the U.S., they were offering me only the typical stereotypical roles: the druggard, the criminal, the gang member, or in the best case scenario, the gardener or the cook. I was fed up with all these roles that were always the same. And I promised I would try to change the image of Latinos in Hollywood.  Now that I was able to co-produce this movie, we felt that it was necessary to change the stereotypes. The natural thing to do in Hollywood was to have me play the poor carpenter. But we wanted a fresh take and changed the genders. That way I can play the billionaire, and we can have Anna play the carpet-cleaning lady. We're breaking stereotypes and we’re also avoiding direct comparison to Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell.  Related:Where are the movies for Hispanic audiences?  More:The 75 best movie comedies of the '80s  Also:Mexico had great night at the Oscars. President Trump still tweeted smear  Q: We still see poor representation of Latino leads in Hollywood films, despite years of #OscarsSoWhite. What needs to change?  Derbez: When we had the years of #OscarsSoWhite, all the African Americans were together and they joined to protest. But right now with this Trump administration, we feel a lot of fear to raise our voices. So we haven’t been able to really raise our hands, raise our voices to say we deserve more opportunities. But I think it’s important. In my case, it’s me producing my own stuff. Right now, I’m my own producer because that's the only way I can have jobs.  Q: Do you think Overboard will be received differently in the Me Too era?  Derbez: We had lot of luck (in the timing of) when we decided to do this. But after the Me Too movement, I cannot imagine what would have happened if we kept the same pattern. Nowadays to have a guy kidnapping a woman to make her work at home? It would be really politically incorrect.  Q: Has the Me Too movement affected filmmaking in Mexico?  Derbez: Honestly, not yet. Hopefully someday a lot of people are going to start speaking out and telling their stories.  Q: What’s been the biggest transition moving from Mexico City to Hollywood three years ago?  Derbez: Everything. I mean, I had a career and a life in Mexico and I had really successful shows (Al Derecho y al Derbez and La familia P. Luche). I had everything back there and all the sudden after Instructions Not Included came out, and it became what it became, I had to make a decision to come here to try to conquer a new market or to continue in my comfort zone.  I have way more freedom in Los Angeles and in the U.S. But it’s funny because when I have a meeting with producers or people from the industry, we go to a restaurant to meet someone and nobody knows me. But all of the sudden, the entire kitchen comes out and they start taking pictures with me, or at valet parking. It's strange to be a very well-known face for some of them and completely unknown for another part of the industry.  Q: Now given the film, I have to ask — are you a yacht guy?  Derbez: I mean, who doesn’t want to have a yacht? But I would prefer to invest my money in something else. But I love them. I just wouldn’t buy one unless I had a lot, a LOT of money.",real
1807,"Ever since he and Angelina Jolie announced their separation, Brad Pitt's love life has been a struggle to keep up with. That's not due to any actual action on his own part; it's wading through all of the rumors. One of those rumors was centered around his relationship with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Neri Oxman, which began in April. As it turns out, though, Pitt is allegedly still single and relishing that fact.  ""He has gone on dates but he’s not looking to leap into a serious relationship at the moment,"" a source close to Pitt told Entertainment Tonight. ""He is content on his own and enjoys the quality time he spends with the children when he isn’t working.""  Instead of spending time on his love life, Pitt has apparently been putting all of his energy into parenting the six children he shares with Jolie, as well as his career, which includes a starring role in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. ""He is focused on two of the most important things he should be focused on, and those are his children and his work,"" the source said, adding that Pitt is “in a great place personally and professionally…. Being a father is his number one job, and he knows that. He will always be there for those children…. He’s spending more time out and about socializing with his close friends, but he also is still a homebody and appreciates hanging around his place.""  Pitt confirmed the latter in his latest revealing interview, with GQ, in which he talked about dealing with his loneliness. ""You have to wrap your stuff up at night and bring order back to your chaos for the next day,"" he said. ""I find it a great opportunity for the introspection. Now you have to be real careful not to go too far that way and get cut off in that way. I'm really good at cutting myself off, and it's been a problem. I need to be more accessible, especially to the ones I love."" Now, it seems like he's taking the time to do that.",fake

The network will inevitably air back-to-back episodes at some point before the finale.)  As previously reported, Season 7 kicks off with a four-year time jump. After returning from a European book tour (that Julius Pepperwood novel must have really taken off!), Nick and Jess begin contemplating marriage. Potentially complicating matters is Jess’ decision to take a job working for ex-boyfriend Russell (again played by Dermot Mulroney).  In addition, Cece and Schmidt are now parents to three-year-old daughter Ruth, with Schmidt having made the transition to stay-at-home dad.

Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according to her new memoir, ‘The Secrets of My Life’. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’.  Caitlyn Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according her memoir, ‘The Secrets of My Life’. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old’s plan from her model son Brody, 33.  ‘Brody told them that Caitlyn has planned and booked a full nude photo shoot and they were like, that’s unacceptable, it’s taking things too far,' the source said.  ‘They’re hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.  Kardashian, the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim and their brother Rob, was part of Simpson’s defense team during his 1995 trial.  The disgraced football star was acquitted of the charges but, in 1998, was found ‘responsible’ for the deaths in a subsequent civil trial.  Writing in her memoir, Jenner says she was in a car with Kardashian a few years after the murders when he said: 'I would’ve been okay with it if they had gotten him [Simpson] in the first trial.'  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old’s plan from her model son Brody  She added: 'The implication was obvious that he believed O.J. was guilty.’  According to a family insider, Kris and the four Kardashians now rarely speak to Jenner.  The insider said: ‘Kylie and do [talk to Jenner]. They do keep in communication and they’re fully supportive [of her transition].  ‘But when Kylie and Kendall do speak with her, it’s always secret – they don’t want to bring it up to their mom or sisters because it causes a lot of drama, so they keep it secret and between them.’  The source added: ‘It’s just the Kardashian part of the family that hasn’t been talking to her. They feel like she had been riding on their coattails long enough for the fame and that she is really milking it for all its worth.  ‘They feel if she wants to do things her way, she should be on her own - a lot of these things that she’s doing are trying to one-up them and trying to gain the spotlight back.  ‘While [the operation] was inevitable, they think her plan to do the nude spread is over the top. That’s something that is really annoying to them.’",fake

How her missing bling is being converted to black market cash.  Kim Kardashian is trapped in a terrorism nightmare after RadarOnline.com learned cops have linked her stolen gems to the coffers of Islamic jihadists!  In a bombshell world exclusive, a top Interpol source claimed they have connected the diamonds snatched from Kardashian’s Paris hotel suite during a brazen Oct. 3 robbery to shady moneymen with ties to radical Islamic terrorists.  French police have busted 17 suspects allegedly involved in the heist, and authorities have connected that gang to black-market dealers in Antwerp, Belgium.  Most of the world’s diamonds pass through the city, where underground brokers are notorious for mixing “dirty” stolen stones with “clean” gems for resale.  Antwerp’s illicit marketplace is a hotbed for devious money-laundering schemes — with profits going to fund violent terrorists around the globe, according to the Financial Action Task Force, an elite band of bean counters that tracks terrorist funds.  “There’s reason to believe the jewelry stolen from Kim Kardashian is going directly into the coffers of terror groups,” said a European official involved in tracking terror groups’ funding.  What’s more, David Levine, a professor at the University of California-Berkeley who’s published works on terrorism, confirmed, “Violent groups are funded by black-market gems.”  Kardashian’s nightmare unfolded last fall, when robbers forced their way into the private Paris residence where she was staying.  They tied her up, held her at gunpoint and then locked her in a bathroom before making off with $10 million worth of jewelry, including her 20-carat emerald-cut diamond engagement ring.  Mixing 36-year-old Kardashian’s stolen jewels with fair-trade diamonds makes them almost impossible to trace, and it’s unlikely she’ll ever get them back, our sources said.  To make matters worse, Kardashian has taken a political stand on behalf of her ancestral homeland of Armenia. Now, she must live with the knowledge her stolen swag could be used to harm her people.  “Who knows what horrors Kim’s bling will end up funding,” said the source.  We pay for juicy info!

1204,"Good news, DC Comics fans. The first look at Aquaman super-villain Black Manta is a pretty faithful adaptation of the comics.  The upcoming blockbuster, which Warner Bros bosses are already promising will set the DCEU back on the right path, has unveiled three new images ahead of the film's launch later this year.  The first of which is The Greatest Showman and The Handmaid's Tale actor Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as David Kane, a bounty and treasure hunter who uses the alias Black Manta.  Director James Wan describes the live-action version of Black Manta as ""part mercenary but full-time pirate"", which is a pretty spot-on description of the comics version of the character.  Wan also clarifies that although Black Manta has a key role to play in Aquaman, the key conflict will be between Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) and his brother Orm (Patrick Wilson).  ""Black Manta is a really interesting character who is somehow factored into this story but our main story is about Jason and Patrick,"" he teased.  EW also premiered alternate covers for its upcoming issue that include the first glimpse of Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, the former Queen of Atlantis and mother of Aquaman's bride Mera (Amber Heard), before sharing three stills from the film too.  In this magazine profile, James Wan teases that his underwater world will include a gritty recreation of the infamous Super Friends scene of Aquaman riding a seahorse, juxtaposed with cannibal trench-dwellers, sea dragons and a giant octopus.  ""The water world my movie takes place in is so separate and so far apart from previous DC movies it's like I'm making my own sci-fi fantasy film,"" Wan said. ""This is a whole new underwater world nobody has seen before in live action.""  Aquaman is released in cinemas on December 14.  Want up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?

14282,"Sing me a song of a lass that is gone  Say, could that lass be I?  The first time I saw the opening lyrics to Outlander’s theme song posted on a friend’s Facebook post, I thought it sounded ridiculous, way too on-the-nose to start every episode by acknowledging the series’ premise. YES WE GET IT CLAIRE YOU DISAPPEARED.  That was before I actually listened to it, and watched the title sequence—and then, like Claire at Craigh na Dun, I fell hard. Now, I forbid my husband from fast-forwarding through the credits every time we watch… and considering that we’ve been bingeing a season at a time, that means I’ve got it well memorized. But why do I find this particular TV opening so compelling?  The answer, I think, is that it presses all of my nerd buttons: it’s a remix of a mashup, with an excellent invocation of Rule 63. It is the platonic ideal of a TV theme song.  Spoilers for Outlander seasons 1 through 3.  I knew that Bear McCreary is behind so many excellent modern scores, from Battlestar Galactica and 10 Cloverfield Lane, but I did not truly appreciate his expertise until I traced the origins of the Outlander theme. Because first he started off with the tune of the 1884 folk song “The Skye Boat Song,” which is not just any random Scottish ditty, but which chronicles the escape of Bonnie Prince Charlie (!) during the Battle of Culloden (!!) at the heart of the Jacobite uprising. Already, amazing season 2 synergy before the damn pilot has even started:  Speed, bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing,  Onward! the sailors cry;  Carry the lad that’s born to be King  Over the sea to Skye. Loud the winds howl, loud the waves roar,  Thunderclouds rend the air;  Baffled, our foes stand by the shore,  Follow they will not dare.  And so forth. But, as Bear explained in his wonderfully detailed Behind the Music-esque blog posts, he wasn’t connecting with the original lyrics by Sir H. Boulton. It was Raya Yarbrough, the voice behind every iteration of the Outlander theme, who suggested swapping them out for Robert Louis Stevenson’s 1892 poem (same subject matter) “Sing Me a Song of a Lad That Is Gone“:  Sing me a song of a lad that is gone,  Say, could that lad be I?  Merry of soul he sailed on a day  Over the sea to Skye. Mull was astern, Rum on the port,  Eigg on the starboard bow;  Glory of youth glowed in his soul;  Where is that glory now?  And on. Except that the tiresome fop Prince Charlie, the worst character from season 2 (I said it), doesn’t deserve to narrate the opening credits. And really, Outlander isn’t about any of the men—not him, not Frank, not Black Jack, not even dear Jamie. So then Bear conjured his inner fangirl and genderswapped RSL’s poem, so instead of Bonnie Prince Charlie talking, it’s Claire. And, let’s be honest, this stanza from the poem sounds more like her than any man anyway:  Billow and breeze, islands and seas,  Mountains of rain and sun,  All that was good, all that was fair,  All that was me is gone.  And it all comes together like a brilliantly remixed fanfic, or an unexpectedly inventive dish on Chopped:  UGH it’s SO GOOD. When the drums pick up after all that was me is gone and she takes off through the forest? /chefskiss  In the words of Eliza Schuyler Hamilton, this could be enough. BUT THEN. It’s not enough to have achieved this remix excellence and just float on your laurels for at least six seasons. Then the brilliant minds behind these credits tapped into my favorite part of golden age of TV-era openings and changed it up for every season. Just as I still have a soft spot for appointment television, I earnestly miss TV show openings that change up the footage every season. It was always a treat to start up the new season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and gawk at all of the moments to look forward to (two Xanders?? a roving monster hand? and of course, the inevitable badass Buffy pose) over the next 22 episodes. Just imagine if every season of Game of Thrones had fleeting shots of Rob Stark getting stabbed, Joffrey purple and spluttering, Cersei’s dragonfire lighting shit up…  To be fair, the Game of Thrones theme is its own work of art, and fits the show: Westeros is so massive, of course we need to see the entire world from the point of view of scholars and military strategists. Also, the twists in A Song of Ice and Fire are so big that to give even a hint of them would ruin many viewers’ experiences. Outlander had to show not so much where physically Claire would wind up, but where in time—to contrast the magic of the Dance of the Druids at the standing stones with the equal magic of turning a radio dial.  That said, the series still very much leans in to its predilection for choosing a new country (sometimes a new continent) for each season. To wit, season 2 saw the Frasers going to France—so Bear and co. replaced the Scottish fiddle and drums with a baroque viola de gambe and even translated a verse into French:  But France was short-lived, with Jamie and Claire returning to Scotland and the fated Battle of Culloden in the latter half of the season. The folks behind the credits could have just washed their hands of it and kept to the Frenchified titles. But do you think they were content with that? OF COURSE NOT. This is war, and the military Scottish snare drums, bagpipes, and shots of shirtless Highlanders versus musket-wielding British soldiers needed to reflect that:  At this point, changing the main titles every season has become an Outlander tradition. At first, season 3’s changes appear a bit subtler, but there: the radio is replaced by a flickering television, broken chains carry incredible significance, and while many of the Scottish elements remain, they’re more somber, more retrospective. Then, instead of adding or replacing something, Bear strips out the bagpipes—signifying the crushing defeat at Culloden. Seriously, every detail, every choice, is so delightfully deliberate:  Thankfully, we do not linger on sadness for long. While the first half of season 2 was very classy and baroque, the latter half of season 3 is shaped by McCreary’s most out-there choice yet: “I cannot imagine any project other than Outlander that would allow me to set a soaring bagpipe melody over blistering congas!” Not unlike Hamilton’s Act 1 ending number “Non-Stop” (one of my favorites in the show), the new Outlander titles utilize congas and other Afro-Cuban influences to impressive dramatic effect. Pack your bags, kiddos, we’re going to the Caribbean:  “Altering a series main title is a risky move,” McCreary wrote when it came to switching things up for season 2. “The entire point of a main title is to be consistent from episode to episode, building a relationship with the audience.” And that could be the case, but when does familiarity begin to breed monotony? Do TV audiences really have a relationship with a static title card and one beat of music, or is it just an extra two seconds to fast-forward to get to the episode at hand?  Claire Beauchamp Randall Fraser’s relationships are as jagged as the lines on her palm: She’s with Frank, then Jamie, then returned to Frank, then reunited with Jamie. As she jumps through time and around the world, aging and changing and conceiving in one timeline but giving birth in another, meeting old friends for the first time and rediscovering new loves, viewers must follow along her dizzying route. She, and they, need a theme song that changes with the show, that always reflects its present moment before shedding that identity and taking on a new one.  Let’s bring back opening credits that match the tone of the show—the headbanging fun of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the almost-too-cheesy folksiness of Firefly’s “You Can’t Take the Sky From Me,” the quick trip through the universe afforded by Futurama. These should be the rule, not the exception—the rule being that even if you have read the books or otherwise know what to expect from your show, it can still surprise you.  Natalie Zutter loves how the Outlander fans made an alternate version of the season 1 credits. Talk the best TV opening credits with her on Twitter!",real

9953,"With Stephen Colbert at the helm, the 2017 Emmys was always going to be a cornucopia of comedy. And because so many social and political issues are being passionately fought, it wasn't surprising that many of the award winners spoke out about what was important to them once they took the stage. Here are the best, funniest, most controversial, and most important moments from TV's night of nights.  1. Sean Spicer showed up.  Look, he's still terrible. And there's no universe in which this was a totally great move. But my jaw legitimately dropped (just like Sarah Hyland's and Anna Chlumsky's) when the former White House press secretary wheeled that lectern out onto the stage. Trump's reign truly is a televisual one.  Giphy  2. Nicole Kidman and Alexander Skarsgård KISSED.  Skarsgård won Best Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for Big Little Lies, and his co-star Nicole Kidman gave him a congratulatory peck on the lips as he approached the stage. FYI, this is how I'll be greeting all handsome men from now on, too.  GIPHY  3. Kate McKinnon gave Hillary Clinton a shout-out.  While accepting her Outstanding Supporting Actress award, McKinnon made sure to thank her SNL muse, presidential candidate Clinton, for her ""grace and grit.""  4. Stephen Colbert glitched.  One of the most fun skits was Colbert's Westworld ""Host"" reveal. It was pitch perfect, political, and silly. But also...does he not have a butt???  This content is imported from Twitter. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  5. Alec Baldwin said that doing Donald Trump impressions is pretty good birth control.  The Saturday Night Live actor thanked his wife when accepting his Outstanding Supporting Actor award, noting that they didn't have a child while he was portraying Trump on the sketch show. Was that because of the orange wig? Probs.  6. Ann Dowd gave an incredibly emotional speech from the heart.  Already teary when she reached the stage, the Handmaid's Tale actress, who scored Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, delivered one of the most moving speeches of the night. But when she thanked the show's streaming home—""They're very lovely, Hulu""—we all melted into a pool of tears along with her.  This content is imported from Twitter. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  7. Can an Emmy award be nominated for an Emmy award?  Because that's what we think RuPaul deserves for her tutting, gossipy portrayal of the Emmy statuette itself. ""Honey, get out your China because I'm ready to spill the tea, okay?"" Any time, Mama Ru.  Giphy  8. We had no idea we wanted a 9 to 5 reunion SO badly.  But now we can't believe we ever lived without it. Dolly Parton, Lily Tomlin, and Jane Fonda gave us a good dream to wish for every night when they came together on stage to present the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie award. Plus, they pointed out some pretty disappointing parallels between their iconic movie and the present day: ""We still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying hypocritical bigot!""  9. Laura Dern.  That's it. Just Laura Dern. Put her in the Met.  10. Lena Waithe became the first black woman to win an Emmy for comedy writing.  She and her Master of None co-writer Aziz Ansari received a standing ovation for their notable achievement, awarded for the episode ""Thanksgiving,"" which focuses on Waithe's character Denise as she comes out to her family. ""Oh, Jesus, let me reclaim my time, give me a second,"" Waithe said. ""My LGBTQIA family, I see each and every one of you. The things that make us different, those are our superpowers.""  11. Jackie Hoffman pretended to lose it when someone else won the award.  Jackie Hoffman, who gave a memorable turn as Mamacita in Feud, gave another great performance when Laura Dern won the award they were both up for. Good old-fashioned shenanigans—we'll never tire of them.  This content is imported from Twitter.

Best moment of the #Emmys so far: Jackie Hoffman yelling ""dammit!!"" when she lost to Laura Dern pic.twitter.com/euCWaRFsAy — Adam Feldman (@FeldmanAdam) September 18, 2017  12. Nicole Kidman won an award, and used the moment to speak out about domestic abuse.  As Big Little Lies' Celeste, a woman whose husband is physically and emotionally abusive, Kidman delivered one of her most memorable performances. So it was no surprise that she chose to talk about the cause when she accepted her Outstanding Lead Actress award: ""We shone a light on domestic abuse. It is a complicated, insidious disease. It exists far more than we allow ourselves to know. It is filled with shame and secrecy, and by you acknowledging me with this award, it shines a light on it even more.""

We survived from all the love, prayers and God.”  On Thursday, Gomez revealed that the reason she quietly stepped back from her career over the summer was that she was recovering from a kidney transplant in hopes of aiding her battle with the chronic autoimmune disease Lupus.

5035,"It has taken 15 years, three presidential elections, and a comedy script from Amy Schumer, but Goldie Hawn—the beloved blonde, Oscar-winning actress—is finally returning to movie screens next month. But why did Hawn leave Hollywood in the first place? In a new interview with daughter Kate Hudson, Hawn finally reveals why she bowed out of the industry after making 2002’s The Banger Sisters.  “I believe that life is about doing,” Hawn explained to Hudson in a conversation for Interview magazine, after being asked the million-dollar question. “It’s about changing. It’s about transitioning. I can’t imagine, as a human being, not being able to grow. When I turned 50, I asked some of my girlfriends, all actresses of the same age, ‘What are we going to do now?’  “I wanted to go live somewhere for a while, learn archaeology, or take part in healing the world on some level,” Hawn continued. “I wanted to dig deep and say, ‘Who am I now? What do I have to offer? What do I have to learn?’ I started learning about the brain, psychology. And after 9/11, I decided, ‘I know what I’m going to do.’ ”  But Hawn wasn’t going to act or produce—she was going to create in an entirely different way.  “I ended up writing two books and creating MindUP,” Hawn says, citing the international educational organization for children she founded. “It’s now in Jordan, Serbia, the U.K., America, Canada, Hong Kong. I never looked back. I never wished to be acting again. I was so engaged.”  (In a previous interview with Yahoo, Hawn also suggested that she had no interest in waiting around for Hollywood offers either: “Every woman hits a certain age; every woman has to face it. That’s the way it goes, and I really am not a sit-around-and-wait-for-the-phone-to-ring person.”)  In 2016, Schumer confessed that it took her several years to convince Hawn to take a role in the mother-daughter comedy she had written.  “I met her on an airplane a couple of years ago and told her there’s a movie I really want to make with her,” Schumer told the Los Angeles Times. “And she was very nice. ‘O.K., honey.’ She probably thought I was a psycho. . . . Then I’d meet her at different things, saying, ‘We’re making this movie together,’ and I think, eventually, some people got in her ear and told her I wasn’t crazy, that I make things.”  In her conversation with Hudson, Hawn also reflected on how the industry changed while she was still acting in film, and the one movie star who is not having any of this television business.  “The business was changing while I was in it,” Hawn reflected. “Conglomerates were coming in, starting to buy studios. Now it’s all about being on the stock market, building amusement parks. Videotapes started back then, and I remember Jack Nicholson saying, ‘I’m never going to be on one of those small screens!’ And I thought, Dude, I don’t think we have a choice!”",real

The mom of daughter Stormi shared a photo of the extravagant arrangement in a Thursday, March 1, Snapchat video. She captioned the clip: “Ok baby daddy.”  Scott, 25, knows his way around a flower shop. Last month he sent the 20-year-old Life of Kylie star 443 white-stem roses that she showed off on social media. In her post, Jenner revealed the adorable reason he selected that exact number. Stormi was born at 4:43 p.m. on February 1.  But Scott doesn’t just do gifts that need water to survive. He gifted his girlfriend of 11 months a black Ferrari as a push present. The custom vehicle — reportedly worth $1.4 million — features red interior and butterfly doors.  The Lip Kit creator has maintained a low profile since Stormi came on to the scene, preferring to stay at home with her newborn. A source previously told Us Weekly that Jenner is “very involved and hands-on” with Stormi and “she’s never seemed happier.”  Jenner shocked the world on February 4 when she finally confirmed her pregnancy after months of speculation and revealed that she had given birth. “I’m sorry for keeping you in the dark through all the assumptions,” she tweeted, revealing she had given birth on the first of the month. “I’ve never felt happiness like this. I could burst! Than you for understanding.”  Scott told TMZ on February 17 that his little one is “beautiful.”",fake
13422,"Who Is Prince Michael Jackson II?  Prince Michael ""Blanket"" Jackson is the third and youngest child of the late Michael Jackson. In 2015 he changed his name to Bigi Jackson. The identity of Prince's biological mother — a surrogate — is unknown. Jackson was seven years old when his father died on June 25, 2009.  Mother  The identity of Jackson’s biological mother, a surrogate, is unknown. He is the third child of pop legend Michael Jackson and allegedly the only biological child of the pop star, but no confirmation has ever been made.  Debbie Rowe, the mother of Michael's other two children — Paris Michael Katherine and Michael Joseph ""Prince"" Jackson — publicly denied being Blanket's biological mother, following his birth and subsequent media speculation regarding his conception.  Father’s Death  On June 25, 2009, Jackson's father, Michael, suffered cardiac arrest at his home in Los Angeles and died shortly thereafter. The pop star was 50 years old at the time of his death; Prince Michael Jackson II was seven.  Jackson's grandmother, Katherine Jackson, became his legal guardian, as well as the guardian of his siblings, Michael and Paris.  The three kids spoke to their father's fans during his funeral in 2009, and again in January 2010, accepting a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award for Michael Jackson at the Grammy Awards.  In February 2010, an official coroner's report on Michael's death was released, revealing that the singer had died from acute propofol intoxication. Aided by his personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, Michael had used the drug, among others, to help him sleep.  A police investigation revealed later that Murray hadn't been licensed to prescribe most controlled medications in California, and the doctor's actions as Michael's caretaker were subsequently further scrutinized. Murray was found guilty of homicide on November 7, 2011, receiving a four-year prison sentence.  Wrongful Death Lawsuit  Believing that A.E.G. Live — the entertainment company that promoted Michael Jackson's planned comeback concert, This Is It, in 2009 — had failed to effectively protect the singer while he was under Dr. Conrad Murray's care, the Jackson family decided to take legal action against the company. Katherine Jackson and Michael's three children officially filed a wrongful death lawsuit against A.E.G.  The trial began in April 2013. Lawyers sought up to $1.5 billion, an estimation of what Michael could have earned over the months since his death if he were still alive, in the case.  In October 2013, a jury determined that A.E.G. wasn't responsible for Michael's death. ""Although Michael Jackson's death was a terrible tragedy, it was not a tragedy of A.E.G. Live's making,"" said Marvin S. Putnam, A.E.G.'s lawyer.  Blanket’s Name Change to Bigi  In 2015, several reports surfaced that Jackson no longer wished to be called by his nickname, ""Blanket."" Radar Online claimed that the young teen now wanted to be addressed as ""Bigi."" He took the name after being bullied for years for his ""Blanket"" moniker.  Bigi Jackson Today  Jackson lives in Calabasas, California. He attends the Buckley School, a private school in Sherman Oaks, California. Due to his grandmother's advanced age, along with siblings Michael and Paris leaving the nest as young adults, Jackson is now under the supervision of older cousin T.J. Jackson.  While sources told People magazine that he had the hardest time of his siblings adjusting after his father’s death, he is now doing well, focusing on grades and sports and spending time with his more than 30 cousins.  Among Michael's kids, Bigi has generally stayed out of the spotlight. However, he made a rare appearance at older brother Prince’s graduation from Loyola Marymount College in Los Angeles in May 2019.",real

Jay Z already owns the 40/40 Club, a sports bar and lounge, but it seems that isn't enough for the business-minded rapper.

2519,"Caitlyn Jenner is reportedly pushing Kanye West to run his own presidential campaign in 2020.  Jenner, who has become somewhat distant to the rest of the Kardashian family in recent years, has remained on good terms with West, it’s been claimed, with Radar Online adding that the two have particularly bonded over their views regarding politics.  While Kanye made it perfectly clear at one of his concerts back in November that he did not vote during the election, the rapper has certainly been favoring Trump in recent weeks, having even accepted an invitation to meet up with the president in New York, back in December.  [Image by Kevin Winter/Getty Images]  The father-of-two later revealed that the meeting was rather positive, insinuating that he was actively working with Donald Trump to make America great again, a slogan that has been used throughout the 70-year-old’s campaign for the presidential position.  With this in mind, Caitlyn Jenner reportedly doesn’t see anyone better to fill Trump’s position than Kanye, a source tells Radar Online.  Caitlyn is brutally honest with Kanye, stressing that he stands a chance to make it into the White House — and when he does, it will be him sitting in the Oval Office, making decisions on behalf of the nation.  It’s been a conversation that’s really brought the twosome closer, and Jenner certainly seems to be the motivation that Kanye has needed to take it more seriously. Whenever Jenner and West get together, the political talk has only made the troubled rapper more determined about his forthcoming run to win the presidential election in 2020.  “Caitlyn Jenner is just the latest reality TV star with political ambitions. But according to an insider, it’s not Jenner herself who will be campaigning for office. Instead, a source told Radar, she’s got her sights set on helping Kanye West make America great again,” the outlet notes.  “Jenner shocked the world when she attended President Donald Trump’s inauguration in Washington DC last week, with not a single family member by her side. West has spoken out in support of the President and even met with him in DC. Jenner now sees him as her ticket into the world of politics.”  Caitlyn Jenner’s political views are what has reportedly seen her relationship with the Kardashians crumble in recent months. The family had already been distant toward Jenner prior to her publicly admitting to being a Trump supporter, but her decision to be so passionate about wanting the 70-year-old in the White House made the likes of Kim and Khloe Kardashian back away from their stepfather.  [Image by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images]  Nobody in the Kardashian household supported Caitlyn’s move to attend Trump’s inauguration, last week, The Hollywood Gossip alleges.  Things have been very rocky between the Kardashians and Caitlyn, so much that the only person that the reality star still has a close relationship with is Kanye West.  It’s further stressed that Kim isn’t happy about Jenner’s influence on her husband of two years. The 36-year-old doesn’t like the supposed fact that Caitlyn is so determined into getting Kanye thinking he will become the next president of the United States.  While Kim is aware that West has wanted to give his presidential campaign a try, Kanye has refrained himself from talking about it until Caitlyn Jenner started bringing it up again — to the point where the “Stronger” superstar is constantly talking about politics and his plans to win the election in 2020.  “Caitlyn and Kanye have bonded a lot over President Trump… Of course, Kim does not want Kanye to run for President! She does not want the humiliation of him ever running for any office.”  What do you make of this? Is Caitlyn Jenner trying too hard to convince Kanye West he stands a chance of winning the election in 2020?  [Featured Image by Kevin Winter/Getty Images]",fake

The 46-year-old actor knew he needed help and Garner was there for him, a source tells ET.  Affleck revealed in March 2017 that he had completed treatment for alcoholism in order to be ""the best father I can be,"" but his history with addiction goes back much further. In fact, his experience with alcoholism began as a child, watching his own father, Timothy, battle the disease.  Affleck has opened up about his past with alcoholism from his family's cycle of addiction to his 2001 rehab stint.    1986: Parents' Divorce  ""To be honest with you, the marriage was so bad, and I remember feeling relief,"" Affleck told Barbara Walters in a 2012 interview, reflecting on his parents' divorce when he was just 12 years old.

My father was a -- what did they call him -- a real alcoholic. He, you know, drank all day, drank every day, and to his credit, he got sober ultimately,"" he revealed. ""He's been sober for several decades, which I think is pretty impressive.""  ""[He] turned his life around in a very laudable way,"" the actor told The Daily Mail in 2008. ""But having such serious addiction issues has a major impact -- it colors who you are and becomes a part of you.""  Though he considered his childhood difficult, Affleck said it was his friend, Matt Damon, and brother, Casey, that helped him deal with his father's alcoholism and parent's divorce.  ""I had good friends. I had Matt Damon, I had my brother, and I had a nucleus of friends that I grew up with and I had support from,"" he told Walters.    1997: Managing Sobriety With Fame  It was a close collaboration with Damon that gained them both fame after 1997's Good Will Hunting -- shortly after which a 24-year-old Affleck stopped drinking.  ""I just wanted to stop. I started regretting some things I did when I was drunk. It's funny to be obnoxious or out of control, but then it's like, 'I think I hurt that person's feelings,' 'I made a fool of myself' or 'I didn't want to kiss that girl,'"" he told a reporter in 1998. ""I have almost no inhibitions, so it's dangerous for me.""    2001: 30-Day Rehab Program  In July 2001, after a reported night of hard partying while between his high-profile relationships with Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Lopez, Affleck completed a 30-day residential rehabilitation program for alcohol abuse, driven to Promises in Malibu by his friend, Charlie Sheen,People reported at the time. After news broke to the press, his publicist confirmed Affleck's rehab stay. ""Ben is a self-aware and smart man who has decided that a fuller life awaits him without alcohol,"" the rep stated. ""He is committed to traveling to a healthier road with the support of his family friends and fans.""  ""I went to rehab for being 29 and partying too much and not having a lot of boundaries and to clear my head and try to get some idea of who I wanted to be,"" Affleck told The Hollywood Reporter in 2012, declining to go into further detail. ""It was more a 'let me get myself straight,' before it became a rite of passage.""    2004: Jennifer Garner's Positive Influence  In 2004, Affleck married Daredevil co-star Jennifer Garner, who a source tells ET put a stop to Affleck's hard partying ways and helped the actor settle down.  According to the source, friends noticed a significant change in the actor after the two got together, noting that Affleck was different than with past women he had dated. He settled down with Garner's positive influence, which ""lasted for a long time"" -- until the pair's split in June 2015.  ""I think becoming a father makes you see the world differently and it’s good,"" Affleck said in a January 2017 interview with The Guardian, reflecting on his past mistakes and his three children with Garner: Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Sam, 5.  ""I’d always had a strong idea about my values and the direction I wanted to be headed in, then I ran into getting famous and it totally spun me around and I flailed around for a few years,"" he confessed. ""When you’re a young man in your 20s, part of that is making mistakes and learning from them. I just made those in front of everybody, rather than privately.""  January 2017: Spotted Out With Sober Coach  Affleck handled his most recent stint in rehab much more privately, though clues to the actor's struggles appeared in January, when the father of three was spotted with a blonde woman while out and about in Los Angeles.  Though some at the time speculated that Affleck might have moved on from Garner (despite living on the same compound), a source told ET at the time that the woman was Elizabeth Weaver, a sober coach with whom he was working to make ""sure he stays on the right path.""  ""Ben has spent a good amount of time with her in recent weeks to kick his alcohol addiction,"" the source said. ""Ben is taking getting sober very seriously and knows he has to do this for his kids. Ben would do anything for his children and is hoping this will make his relationship with Jen better.""  February 2017: Staying Sober at the Oscars  A source tells ET that though Affleck is no longer working with Weaver, he was sober at the 2017 Academy Awards while supporting his little brother, Casey, as he won the Best Actor Oscar, and had a male sober companion by his side throughout the night.  March 2017: ""Feeling Good"" After Rehab Announcement  Affleck's Tuesday announcement credited his family, namely his three children, as his motivation for seeking treatment.  ""I have completed treatment for alcohol addiction; something I've dealt with in the past and will continue to confront. I want to live life to the fullest and be the best father I can be,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""I want my kids to know there is no shame in getting help when you need it, and to be a source of strength for anyone out there who needs help but is afraid to take the first step.""  ""I'm lucky to have the love of my family and friends, including my co-parent, Jen, who has supported me and cared for our kids as I've done the work I set out to do,"" he continued.

9891,"Tough treadmill and weight-lifting interval workouts and loads of coconut oil are just two of the ways the actress, businesswoman, and mom of two stays looking radiant—despite her serious sugar addiction.  Eva Mendes is in her happy place, and it shows. The actress, 43, is blissed out as Ryan Gosling's leading lady; the mom of Esmeralda, 2, and Amada, 11 months; and the successful head of a fashion line, the Eva Mendes Collection at New York & Company, and a beauty brand, Circa. She's also savoring her role as Ryan's rock behind the scenes as he hits the awards circuit for La La Land. ""What people don't know about me is that I love being home,"" Eva says. ""Instead of hitting the red carpet, I'd rather be with our girls.""  Another thing Eva relishes is ex­­er­­cise, and that too is evident in her strong body and beautiful skin. ""Working out allows me to spend time on myself,"" she says. ""Knowing that I have an hour to dedicate to my wellness is a priority for me now."" She tries to eat ""as clean as possible"" but also digs into her favorite indulgences with gusto. One of Eva's top treats: Cadbury eggs. ""The mini ones and the big ones with the filling,"" she says. And then there's her mother's delicious Cuban cooking. ""My mom makes the best black beans in the world,"" she says. ""I'll never stop devouring them.""  Listen in as Eva expands on the life philosophies that keep her healthy and radiantly happy.  Believe in finding the One...workout  ""I love doing intervals, like running and sprinting, and I see great results with that versus the 30 or 45 minutes of steady cardio I used to do on the treadmill. Between intervals, I lift weights. Right now I'm sticking to light weights because I have a herniated disc in my lower back. It's pretty severe, and I have to work around it. I love squats, but I've been told that I have to do lunges instead of squats for the time being. I know a lot of people wouldn't find that heartbreaking, but I really do!  ""I'm off-season right now, so I work out three days a week. But when I'm getting ready for an event or in the summer, it's five days a week. I don't exercise more than that though, because I see better results when my body has a rest period.""  There are perks to everything-you just have to look  ""In some ways, it's been more challenging to get back in shape after my second daughter. Yet it's not as hard as I thought it would be, because I'm always running around with the kids. I never sit down-I'm on the move all day. And I don't keep junk food at home anymore, because I'm trying to set a good example. So there are no more Krispy Kremes for me to grab. But there is this app called Postmates that delivers whatever you want in minutes. It's almost as bad as having the food in your kitchen. Don't laugh, but they're on the way here right now!""  Image zoom  Rely on tricks to look lit  ""For me, glowing skin comes from the inside. I start to get sallow if I'm not eating well. I take fish oil supplements. And I love coconut oil. I apply it to my face. That's my go-to. I also drink a lot of water. I always keep a bottle with me and kind of force myself to drink. My skin just looks better when I'm hydrated.  ""I wear makeup every day. Typically, it's minimal-a little eyeliner, lip liner and balm, and some concealer. It takes me about five minutes to apply it. But when I get ready for an event or a dinner, I do like to take my time putting my makeup on. To me, the process of getting ready can be really, really romantic. It takes me probably 45 minutes because I go very slow.  ""I've learned some very good makeup tricks too, like how important it is to work with your face shape. Because I have a long face, my makeup artist taught me to swipe blush across one cheek and lightly over the nose, then over the other cheek to help break up the length a bit. Another great tip to try: Add some illumination to your Cupid's bow right above your lip by putting a little bit of highlighter-or even a dab of light eyeshadow-there. That will give some pop to your lips.""  Protein is your power  ""I usually start my day with eggs. I think they're like magic-you can do so much with them. I mostly keep it simple and have scrambled eggs and a piece of Ezekiel toast for breakfast. But if somebody brings over muffins or some other kind of delicious treat, I'll eat that with my coffee instead. It's a terrible way to begin my day, though. I really regret it later, because I just don't have as much energy. I find that when I start out with the right source of protein, it definitely helps.  I grew up eating rice and beans, so I want some kind of grain in every meal. For lunch, I usually have salmon and rice or quinoa, and I try to include a salad. I'll eat the same thing for dinner. I'm a creature of habit in that way. I don't get bored with food. I try to think about it as fuel for my body. But what I am looking forward to is the time when dinner becomes a sit-down situation again. Right now I'm in survival mode with two babies, eating on the go.""  Image zoom  A little sugar is important too  ""Sweets are my thing. It's ongoing, and I have to manage my sugar cravings constantly. I've gotten used to having something sweet after every meal, so I'm always bartering with myself: No, no, I can't have that after dinner, but maybe I can have it after lunch instead. The kid in me thinks, I work out, so I can support my sugar habit. I know that's not a very wise thing to say, but I really do feel like I'm working it off!""",real

A report from The Sun has claimed the former lovers are 'seriously' considering starring together in a new romantic comedy.  'As well as being back in touch as friends, suddenly an opportunity has cropped up that would put Brad and Jen in a major movie together for the first time - and they're seriously considering it,' a source told Heat magazine.  Although, the roles would not see the pair play lovers. They would need to interact on screen though.  'It's not like they would be playing lovers or anything, but the project is in the romantic comedy genre and their characters would cross paths. The movie producers are really excited and feel this would be dynamite casting,' the source continued.",fake

All you have to do is look at his Twitter feed: ""Anybody who knows me knows my one lifetime crush has been Jennifer Aniston"" reads a tweet from February 12, 2014.  Now it looks like dreams do come true — even for NFL superstars. On Monday night, Watt met his lifetime crush, and he couldn't help exulting about it. He tweeted the photo above, with the caption, ""I'm not even going to try to pretend like I acted cool when this happened. #LifeMade""  We're guessing the duo met in Los Angeles, where Watt will appear on the ESPY Awards Wednesday night. The two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year is up for Best Male Athlete alongside Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors), LeBron James (Cleveland Cavaliers) and Aaron Rodgers (Green Bay Packers). He's also a nominee for Best NFL Player along with Tom Brady (New England Patriots), Antonio Brown (Pittsburgh Steelers), DeMarco Murray (Philadelphia Eagles) and Aaron Rodgers (Green Bay Packers).  But even if he doesn't take home the sports award, he's had quite an offseason, cavorting with tennis star Caroline Wozniacki in Paris, pretending to be a security guard for the Zac Brown Band, doing a dead-on impression of Arnold Schwarzenegger and flying in a private plane — which still excites Watt, even though he's a multimillionaire.",fake

We exclusively learned the actor has zero interest in dating!  While we’re sure many women are pining after Chris Pratt, 38, after he and his wife Anna Faris, 40, announced their split last week, the truth is, Chris has no plans whatsoever to date in the near future. Instead, the Passengers star is determined to stay focused on his booming career as well as being the best dad he can be to his and Anna’s son Jack Pratt, 4. “No one at all should even try to connect Chris with anyone because he is not looking to get into a relationship in any way shape or form,” a source close to Chris told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  “He is definitely mourning losing Anna and has to work that out before he even thinks about getting into another relationship. He is going to drown himself into his work and being a great father only.” We can totally respect that! After all, the favorite Hollywood couple tied the knot eight years ago, and their split came as a major shock to fans. Anna especially is reportedly taking the separation particularly hard. “Anna can’t believe she’s going to have to start dating again in her 40s,” another insider told us EXCLUSIVELY. “Just thinking about it makes her break down in tears. She can’t even wrap her head around it.” Click here to see pics of Anna and Chris’ relationship timeline.  The couple announced their separation on Aug. 6, with a social media statement that just about broke our hearts. “We are sad to announce we are legally separating. We tried hard for a long time, and we’re really disappointed,” the post read. “Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep this situation as private as possible moving forward. We still love each other and will always cherish our time together. Anna Faris and Chris Pratt.”  Clearly Anna and Chris are making Jack a priority throughout this whole ordeal though. In fact, Chris has already made a public appearance with their adorable son since news of his split surfaced. The actor stepped out to take Jack to church on Aug. 13, and Chris carried the preschooler, which was almost too much cuteness to handle!

14337,"Andrea Mandell  USA TODAY  An untimely death, especially a famous one, can color the truth.  I Am Heath Ledger, a new documentary about the actor supported by his family, dispels one common rumor: The Joker did not bring the Australian actor down.  “Honestly, that’s been the biggest thing for us as a family,” says Kate Ledger, Heath’s elder sister, by phone. “He had an amazing sense of humor and certainly playing the Joker, for him it was one big gag. He had so much fun doing that. It was actually the exact opposite. There was no doom and gloom. ... That was a shock to me that people even thought that, really.”  The documentary hits theaters tonight (Wednesday) for one night only in partnership with Fathom Events, and then will air on Spike TV on May 17.  Ledger died on Jan. 22, 2008, at age 28 in New York City from an accidental overdose of prescription medication and sleeping aids. The role of the Joker would win him a posthumous Oscar for his work in The Dark Knight in 2009.  “Like many of us, we read all sorts of insinuations online that Heath Ledger was taken down this dark spiral path to the depths of depression from his role as the Joker — this is the reason why we lost this bright star so early in his life,” says I Am Heath Ledger producer and co-director Derik Murray. “What was incredible, what was really quite amazing is that the truth behind that is so polar opposite.”  I Am Heath Ledger begins during Ledger’s youth, utilizing hours of the actor’s own home videos. The film charts his quick rise in Hollywood. Less than a year after moving to Los Angeles, he booked the lead role in the 1999 hit teen rom-com 10 Things I Hate About You opposite Julia Stiles.  Then Ledger pivoted, turning down opportunities like Spider-Man and making films that would lead him to work like Lords of Dogtown and his Oscar-nominated role in Brokeback Mountain.  “As you see in the documentary, he could have very easily gone down that heartthrob career (path) and done a lot of those roles, and he chose not to right from the very beginning,"" says Kate. ""He wanted to be taken seriously as an actor. He was always in command of what he did. He wouldn’t just do something for the money.”  Kate Ledger says filmmakers have been knocking at her family’s door since her brother’s death, but it was the involvement of executive producer Matt Amato, her brother’s close friend, that gave them trust the documentary would be done right.  Plus, they had Michelle Williams’ blessing. “We wouldn’t have done anything otherwise,” says Kate, revealing little about Ledger’s ex-girlfriend or their child together, Matilda (now 11), though she confirms the family sees both often. “I love them so much and I’m so protective of them that I don’t like to discuss them. Because it’s very private, their life, and I just like to keep it like that,” she says.  Though Ledger’s parents, directors and friends (including Naomi Watts and Ben Harper) appear in the documentary, Williams does not. “She just felt she was not ready to be on camera and be talking about Heath, which we respected,” says Murray.  Today, Kate Ledger says dealing with her brother’s death as the world watched nine years ago was indescribable.  “It’s almost like two separate things. The shock itself was one thing and dealing with it in the public eyes was completely different — I actually can’t put it into words and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to,” says Ledger, who has since set up a scholarship in her brother’s name for emerging Australian talent. “Not too many people have to experience that. It’s hard enough to experience losing a loved one (without) doing it in front of everyone else. It’s horrendous.”",real

Nevertheless, the two did their best to overcome their issues together and Bushnell moved to Higgins’ hometown of Denver shortly after going public with their engagement following the season finale, which aired in March.  Of Higgins declaration of love to both women, Bushnell told PEOPLE exclusively at the time that “post-filming was more of an emotional roller coaster than the actual show.”  “I fall more in love with Ben every day and it’s hard to separate what happened long ago and my current feelings,” she said. “It’s confusing. It does wear on me.”  “It hurts,” she added. “It’s like, why did I have to go through that hurt? It’s already a few months of confusion and tears and then to have to deal with it again. It’s hard.”  Higgins, meanwhile, told PEOPLE he couldn’t apologize “for being honest or expressing what I thought was the best thing to express at the time.”  “Don’t get us wrong. Throughout this whole show airing and conversations we’ve had about decisions and life, it hasn’t always been easy,” he continued. “But it’s added a whole new level to our relationship.

You can say that’s what I signed up for, but it’s still real life and it’s still hard.”  And overcoming trust issues that lingered after the Fletcher drama wasn’t easy, either.  “For a long time, I was really angry for being blindsided,” said Bushnell. “And that resentment and anger affected our relationship much longer than it should have.”  Ultimately, the two always maintained they were “not in any rush” to tie the knot.  “We’re both ready to get married, but we haven’t set a date because we want to make sure we’re not doing it for anyone but ourselves,” said Bushnell.",real

Christian de Rocquigny, the prosecutor investigating the celebrity chef's death, would not disclose the amount of alcohol, but said there were signs he had drank significantly the night before he died. He added that there were no narcotics in his body; only a ""therapeutic dose"" of a nonnarcotic medication. He would not disclose the name of the medication.  De Rocquigny said there were signs of a ""repas arrosé,"" a French term typically translated as a ""boozy dinner.""

19709,"Harry Styles has managed to raise over $1.2 million (£916,000) for charity during his ambitious 90-show-10-month debut solo world tour.  This comes after the One Direction singer said that everyone is a little bit gay at his concert in New York, months after fans hailed his new song Medicine as an anthem for bisexual people.  In addition to the tour promoting the theme of inclusiveness and treating people with kindness, Variety reported Harry Styles had raised money for 62 charities around the world.  Harry Styles has managed to raise over $1.2 million for charity during his debut solo world tour  After releasing his first solo debut album that many have considered to be unconventional and moving in a very different direction to his previous music, Harry won over critics with the release of his glam-rock inspired LP.  As reported in Forbes, his self-titled album, that reached the top of the Billboard 200, included his hit single Sign of the Times, which reached no. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100.  Variety revealed that one million tickets were sold for his 90-show tour and saw the former Directioner perform in intimate venues as well as arenas, with support from the likes of Leon Bridges, Muna, Warpaint and Kacey Musgraves.  89 of his shows were sold out and it was the first arena tour to sell out through Ticketmaster’s new Verified Fan program with the first leg selling out in 29 seconds.  Harry’s final show at the Forum in Inglewood, California tallied over 17,000 paid tickets and beat the record for the most paid tickets for a single show since the venue opened for the second time back in 2014.  The world tour also had a charitable impact and raised $1.2 million from ticket contributions, Live Nation contributions and matching payments, as well as encouraging hundreds of new voters to register via Headcount.  Harry also made an effort to promote water conservation by saving the equivalent of 10,000 single-use water bottles by fans and 3,200 by the band and crew.  He also partnered with the GLSEN campaign, which works to create a safe and inclusive environment in schools for LGBTQ youth. On his final stop, Harry also paused to comment on a fan’s sign before performing What Makes You Beautiful.  Billboard reported that after reading the sign, he said ‘Can I read this? It says, “I’m gay and I love you.”’ After thanking the fan, Harry said: ‘I mean, we’re all a little bit gay, aren’t we?",real

14006,"Guillermo del Toro. Photo: Kevin Winter/Getty Images  When Natalie Portman introduced the Best Director candidates at the Golden Globes as the “all-male nominees,” it inspired a bit of controversy. Onscreen, it appeared as if the directors — Martin McDonagh, Christopher Nolan, Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg, and Guillermo del Toro — might have been a bit miffed. However, you can at least consider the smiling eye roll that del Toro gave to the camera to be a sheepish reaction instead of an offended one. The Shape of Water filmmaker and Globe recipient for Best Director told IndieWire that he approves of Portman’s comment, “I think it was great! She should say exactly what she feels. There is phenomenal work being done by female directors.” He then cited three films that were helmed by women directors in 2017 that could have also received award nods. “Mudbound, Lady Bird, and Wonder Woman are all terrific,” he said.  If this year’s Oscars are anything like the Golden Globes, hopefully del Toro will pass on the memo to his rivals. For what it’s worth, Spielberg doesn’t believe women will be shut out of the upcoming Academy Awards Oscars.",real

16466,"Antonio Banderas at the photo call for Genius: Picasso in Madrid. Photo by Fotonoticias/WireImage/Getty Images  Eyebrows have many capabilities. For those like Cara Delevingne, they can make your career. For those like Kendall Jenner, they can cement your status as a serious model, because only those actually committed to the runway would bleach their brows and become full-on goth for at Marc Jacobs. And, well, as for both celebrities and, you know, normal people? Eyebrows of course also serve the central purpose of subtly and effectively keeping sweat and debris from falling into your eyes, thereby protecting your vision.  But none of these capabilities, apparently, appeal to Antonio Banderas, who, at the moment, seems to be completely devoid of eyebrows. On Wednesday, the 57-year-old actor stepped out on a red carpet in Madrid without any visible hair on his head. (Okay, he still has his eyelashes, but that's an oversight we're quite thankful for.) According to E!, the look is ostensibly part of his getting into character for his starring role as Pablo Picasso in the upcoming National Geographic series Genius: Picasso. Take a closer look at the red carpet, though, and you may start to question this reasoning.  What's that Banderas is standing in front of? A larger-than-life photo of his face in his portrayal of Picasso, in which the artist has eyebrows. We haven't seen the series yet, so it's unclear whether the poster is simply a less jarring image of Banderas than that which will appear onscreen, or if the two looks simply show Picasso at different stages of his life, since Banderas had previously shared a photo of himself in the role with plenty of gray hair on his face. When he made a lower-key red-carpet appearance sans eyebrows back in December, it simply seemed likely he was still finishing up filming. That possibility seems much less viable this week, though, with the series' April 24 premiere date fast approaching.  Antonio Banderas Takes W's Screen Test:  In Madrid, the two juxtaposed Banderases certainly did make for an, um, eyebrow-raising red-carpet moment. And if Banderas is simply trying out a new look, we're completely for that. It may just be that he discovered he actually prefers his onscreen look, or that he's simply looking for some change. Given his track record of late, which includes studying at the same storied fashion school as Alexander McQueen and creating his own line of candles, Banderas does seem to be quite into trying new things. In any case, it's certainly a better look than some of the others he's recently rocked on his Instagram.

4677,"American television period sitcom  That '70s Show is an American television period sitcom that originally aired on Fox from August 23, 1998, to May 18, 2006. The series focuses on the lives of a group of six teenage friends living in fictional Point Place, Wisconsin, from May 17, 1976, to December 31, 1979.[1]  The main teenage cast members were Topher Grace, Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, Danny Masterson, Laura Prepon, Wilmer Valderrama and Lisa Robin Kelly. The main adult cast members were Debra Jo Rupp, Kurtwood Smith, Don Stark, Tommy Chong and Tanya Roberts.  Cast [ edit ]  Teens/Young Adults [ edit ]  Adults [ edit ]  Debra Jo Rupp as Kitty Forman: Red's wife and mother of Eric and Laurie, and Hyde's informally adoptive mother, Kitty is a cheerful, doting mother, but can also be assertive when pushed. A nurse by profession, she drinks heavily and is a former smoker. Her major mood swings are usually attributed to menopause, although the lack of affection and attention from her daughter (Laurie) and her mother (Bea) is also partly to blame. She is also a nurturing mother figure to Eric's rather dysfunctional friends, especially Fez.  Kurtwood Smith as Red Forman: Kitty's husband, father of Eric and Laurie, and Hyde's adoptive father. A conservative Navy combat veteran, he served in World War II and the Korean War. He is frequently hard on Eric and casually insults him, often calling him “dumbass”. Despite his mean exterior, Red also displays a soft side. His hobbies include working with his power tools, drinking beer, watching television, reading the newspaper, hunting and fishing. The producers sought Chuck Norris for the role, but the actor declined due to commitments with Walker, Texas Ranger. Smith (the only cast member born in Wisconsin) modeled his performance after his relationship with his stepdad, who died shortly before the pilot was filmed.  Lisa Robin Kelly (seasons 2–3; recurring season 1; special appearance season 5) and Christina Moore (recurring season 6) as Laurie Forman : Eric's attractive but promiscuous, manipulative and dishonest older sister. She flunked out of college during the first season and moves back home with her parents. Laurie enjoys tormenting Eric and manipulating her parents. She is promiscuous, often seen with various men, mainly Eric's friend Kelso, who cheats on his girlfriend Jackie. Eric, Hyde and Donna often insult her for her promiscuity. She also has a strained relationship with her mother who thinks of her as a freeloader. She leaves the series during the third season, but returns in a recurring role during the fifth. In season five, she marries Fez to prevent him from getting deported. She leaves the series again during season 6 and is never seen again. During the seventh season, she is mentioned as having moved to Canada, where, as Eric puts it drolly, ""bottomless dancing is legal"".  : Eric's attractive but promiscuous, manipulative and dishonest older sister.

During the seventh season, she is mentioned as having moved to Canada, where, as Eric puts it drolly, ""bottomless dancing is legal"". Tanya Roberts as Midge Pinciotti (seasons 1–3; special guest appearance seasons 6–7): Bob's wife, Donna's mother, and Kitty's best friend, Midge is the sexy mom whom Eric and his male friends fantasize when coming of age. Although often dim-witted, she later adopts some feminist ideals. She is written out of the series in 2001 after the third season after divorcing Bob and moving to California. She returns during the sixth and seventh seasons in a limited recurring role. She is temporarily replaced in Bob's heart by the aggressive, assertive Joanne (played by Mo Gaffney), tall like Midge but not as pretty.  Don Stark as Bob Pinciotti: Midge's husband and Donna's father. Bob often brags about his service in the National Guard, which invariably irritates Red, a veteran of foreign wars. Bob is known for walking around his house with his robe wide open and no underwear. He eats constantly, even in bed. Bob is almost always in a good mood and is a ladies' man. His best friend is Red, who usually considers him to be a nuisance. He usually takes the brunt of Red's abuse in a jolly manner. After Midge divorced Bob in the fourth season, he began dating Joanne (in seasons four and five) and Pam Burkhart (played by Brooke Shields replacing Eve Plumb from the first season), Jackie's mother (in seasons six and seven).  Tommy Chong as Leo (seasons 4 & 8; special guest seasons 2–3 & 7): A hippie, and the owner of a Foto Hut at which Hyde once worked, Leo is an Army veteran who served in World War II, where he was awarded a Purple Heart. Leo often puts play before work and maintains an easy-going attitude in most things, business included. He disappears from the series after season four, but is later referenced in season five's ""The Battle of Evermore"" when the gang goes on a mission to find him, but with no luck. He returns in season seven and remains on the series until the show's end. In Season 8, he gets a new job working for Hyde at Grooves.

The idea that the duration of the series would carry sociopolitical undertones also necessitated a chain of social events which could influence the characters. Thus, 1976 was chosen, which allowed episodes set within a short time frame to address streaking, the sexual revolution, the Equal Rights Amendment, the 1973 oil crisis, and the presidencies of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, all of which were culturally influential events that occurred in the earlier years of the 1970s. The shift to 1977 during the last half of the first season also allowed the inclusion of the first Star Wars movie, which premiered in May 1977.  Throughout the first two seasons, episodes opened with title cards showing the season/month and year (example: Late Spring, 1977 or June 1977). These were largely abandoned after season two, with few subsequent episodes using them. However, they were used again in the final episode, i.e. ""December 31, 1979 10:45 a.m."" From the premiere onward, the episode's year could be determined by the registration tags on Eric's Vista Cruiser at the end of the opening and closing credits. Season 1 showed a ""76"" year tag, seasons 2–3 showed ""77"" tags, seasons 3–6 showed ""78"" tags, seasons 7–8 showed ""79"" tags, and the final episode of season 8's closing credits showed an ""80"" tag.  The show was set in May 1976 in the August 23, 1998 premiere. After 12 episodes, the series transitioned to 1977. The 23rd episode, ""Grandma's Dead"", was also set in 1976, because it was supposed to be the season finale of season 1. The show remained in 1977 for the next two seasons. Near the end of the third season, the series transitioned to 1978 until early in the sixth season. The remaining episodes took place in 1979, and the series finale abruptly ends during a New Year's Eve party as the characters reach ""one"" during a countdown to January 1, 1980.[4]  As the only series to debut on Fox in 1998 to survive cancellation, the show's unexpected longevity combined with the first season jump to 1977 necessitated a slow-down of the series' timeline. Over time, this proved problematic from a narrative standpoint, as nearly every year featured a Thanksgiving and/or Christmas episode, and the teen-aged actors playing high-school student characters all aged into their mid-20s by the time their characters graduated from high school after five seasons (except Mila Kunis, who was not quite 20). As the series' timeline increasingly varied in pace towards the climax, several major events were depicted as having occurred months apart, which otherwise would have normally been depicted as happening within days or weeks of one another.  The timeline issues experienced on the show were not unprecedented, as other period-specific TV series have had similar issues. Most notably, M*A*S*H aired for 11 seasons despite the Korean War only lasting three years. Additionally, many TV series over the years that take place in the present time have characters age faster than normal while other characters age naturally.  Eighth season and series finale [ edit ]  The character of Eric Forman was written out of the series at the end of the seventh season, as Topher Grace wanted to move on with his career.[5] Ashton Kutcher switched to a recurring guest role when he also chose to depart following the seventh season.[5] However, Kelso had not been written out yet, so to give better closure to the character, Kutcher appeared in the first four episodes of the eighth season (credited as a special guest star) and later returned for the finale. Tommy Chong (who began reappearing by late season 7 after a long absence) became a regular again to help fill Kelso's role as the dimwit of the group. Eric was originally supposed to be replaced by his new friend Charlie, played by Bret Harrison, as an ""innocent character"", who proved fairly popular with audiences, but the character was killed off after Harrison was offered a lead role in the series The Loop.[6] Another new character named Randy Pearson, played by Josh Meyers (brother of Late Night host Seth Meyers), was introduced to take the place of both Eric and, to a lesser extent, Charlie.[7] Another new character, Samantha, a stripper played by Jud Tylor, was added as Hyde's wife for nine episodes. The location of the show's introductory theme song was changed from the Vista Cruiser to the circle. Both Eric and Kelso returned for the series' final episode, although Topher Grace was uncredited.  The eighth season was announced as the final season of the show on January 17, 2006,[8] and ""That '70s Finale"" was filmed a month later on February 17, 2006, first airing on May 18, 2006.[9]  Production [ edit ]  Title [ edit ]  The working titles for the show were:  However, due to song-rights refusals (including The Who's Pete Townshend) and Fox Network's deeming Feelin' All Right less than memorable, co-creator Bonnie Turner suggested that the show should be titled That '70s Show, after hearing an audience member saying ""I loved that show about the '70s."" It was at that point where it ultimately became the official title for the show.[10]  Opening [ edit ]  Theme song [ edit ]  The show usually opens with the theme song, ""In the Street"", written by Alex Chilton and Chris Bell of the highly influential cult band Big Star. The original version of the song appeared on Big Star's 1972 debut album #1 Record. In 2000, Chilton confirmed that he was paid $70 in royalties each time the show aired, an amount he thought ironic, given the show's title.[11]  Big Star's original version of the song was not used on the show. Instead, a cover version sung by Todd Griffin was used as the theme song for the show's first season. Beginning in the second season, the theme song was performed by the band Cheap Trick. Unlike previous versions of the song, Cheap Trick ended the song with the repeated phrase ""We're all alright!"" quoting the ending of their 1978 hit song ""Surrender"".[12]  Both versions of the song (Todd Griffin and Cheap Trick) used on the show end with somebody yelling ""Hello, Wisconsin!"" In Griffin's version, Danny Masterson is the one yelling ""Hello, Wisconsin!""[13] while it is unknown who yells it in Cheap Trick's version. On the soundtrack, That '70s Album (Rockin'), Cheap Trick's lead singer Robin Zander yells ""Hello, Wisconsin!""[14] Alternate holiday versions of the theme song were arranged for Halloween and Christmas specials, using organ music and bells, respectively.  Opening credits [ edit ]  Opening credits for seasons 1–7 showed members of the cast driving in Eric's car singing the theme song together except Kurtwood Smith (with the exception of episodes 16 to 25 of the third season where he sings ""Down the Street""). At the conclusion of the opening, a shot of a 1970s-style Wisconsin license plate (black letters/numbers on a yellow background) is seen, showing the year in which the episode was taking place in the bottom right corner. During the first season's opening, a single shot of the group is used; beginning with season 2, numerous alternating shots were used of the cast in various groupings (including the adult cast members, who had not appeared in the first season's opening).  After Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher left the series, the opening credits were reworked for season 8 to feature close-up shots of each of the actors singing (or mouthing) a line of the theme song in the Circle (for example, Mila Kunis ""Hanging Out...;"" Danny Masterson ""Down the Street""). The only actors to not say or do anything in the new opening credits were Kurtwood Smith and Tommy Chong, with the exception of the first episode of season 8, when Chong sings the last ""We're all alright"". Smith looks at the camera frowning and rolls his eyes. Chong looks around the room, confused as he hears ""Hello, Wisconsin!"" The final episode omits most of the opening sequence and instead only shows the license plate shot.  Elements of the show [ edit ]  The 1970s [ edit ]  The show addressed social issues of the 1970s such as sexual attitudes, generational conflict, the economic hardships of the 1970s recession, mistrust of the American government by blue-collar workers, and underage drinking/teenage drug use. The series also highlighted developments in the entertainment industry, including the television remote (""the clicker""), reruns, VCR, and cable TV; the video games Pong and Space Invaders; the cassette tape and Disco; MAD magazine; and Eric's obsession with Star Wars.[15] The show has been compared to Happy Days, which was similarly set 20 years before the time in which it aired.[16]  The show featured guest-starring actors from 1970s TV shows, such as Mary Tyler Moore, Valerie Harper and Betty White (The Mary Tyler Moore Show), Tom Poston and Jack Riley (The Bob Newhart Show), Pamela Sue Martin (The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries), Tim Reid and Howard Hesseman (WKRP in Cincinnati), Eve Plumb, Barry Williams and Christopher Knight (The Brady Bunch), Tom Bosley and Marion Ross (Happy Days), Monty Hall (Let's Make a Deal), Gavin MacLeod (The Love Boat and The Mary Tyler Moore Show), Don Knotts, Richard Kline and Jenilee Harrison (Three's Company), and Danny Bonaduce and Shirley Jones (The Partridge Family). Series recurring cast member Tanya Roberts also starred in a popular show in the 1970s (Charlie's Angels).  Beginning with season 5, each episode in the series is named after a song by a rock band that was famous in the 1970s: Led Zeppelin (season 5), The Who (Season 6), The Rolling Stones (season 7), and Queen (season 8, except for the finale, titled ""That '70s Finale"").[17]  Split screens [ edit ]  One device in the show is to present a split screen in which two pairs of characters speak. One character is usually seeking advice on a problem with a character in the second pairing and the other character advises them. Although the conversations appear to mirror each other, notable differences often occur. It is most often used by the couples of the show, with each member of the couple being advised on the relationship. For example, in the episode ""Who Wants It More?"", Donna and Eric tell Jackie and Hyde that they have been holding out on each other sexually for three days and that maybe they should cave. Both Jackie and Hyde tell Donna and Eric not to cave or the ""caver"" will be owned by the other.  Dream sequences [ edit ]  The show includes character daydream sequences, some of which refer to or parody fads and films of the time, such as Star Wars, Rocky, and Grease.  The character picturing the dream sometimes also narrates it, but regardless, the other characters present see the same dream. In the episode ""Stone Cold Crazy"", Jackie mentioned she liked the song playing in Fez's dream sequence. The sequences are usually introduced by a wobbling screen transition. Sometimes, the transition is absent when the characters who imagine the scene believe they are real (for example, Eric's dream about Donna in ""Eric's Birthday"" or Jackie's dream about Hyde proposing in ""It's All Over Now"").  In the 100th episode, ""That '70s Musical"", all singing scenes were Fez's dream sequences.  The circle [ edit ]  The circle illustrated the teens' marijuana use, usually in Eric's basement. The picture is of the final scene of the series.  In the circle, a group of characters, usually the teenagers, sit in a circle (generally in Eric's basement, though occasionally elsewhere), as the camera pans, stopping at each character as he or she speaks. It was usually apparent that the characters are under the influence of marijuana. Thick clouds of smoke, frequent coughing and an extreme wide-angle lens added to the ""drug-induced"" feel, although the audience never saw anyone actually smoking the drug. Also, no visible drug-related paraphernalia were seen, such as bongs or joint papers. Characters never spoke the word ""marijuana"" while in the circle (except in one episode ""Reefer Madness""), often referring to it as ""stuff"" or a ""stash"". In the episode ""Bye-Bye Basement"", Theo (Leo's cousin) refers to ""weed""; in ""The Relapse"", Kelso tells Fez that the concrete wall behind the gym is used mostly for ""smoking weed and beating up freshmen;"" in ""Ski Trip"" Kitty asks Eric why he is taking so much oregano to Jackie's ski lodge; in ""Eric's Burger Job"", Kelso blames his ""roach clip"" when the water bed pops on which he is sitting at a party; in two episodes (""That Wrestling Show"" and ""Hyde Moves In""), Eric and Hyde can be seen wearing shirts with the words ""Cannabis Sativa"" written on a Campbell's soup can; and in ""The Pill"", Red, referring to Kelso, exclaims, ""That kid's on dope!"" A gimmick related to the circle and the marijuana smoking was Eric watching the kitchen wall moving erratically, although this technique was also used to show that Eric was drunk.  As the series progressed, the circle became one of the series' recurring features. The only four episodes where the whole gang is in the circle are ""Class Picture"", ""I'm A Boy"", ""Substitute"", and in the series finale. During the eighth and final season, the circle sans smoke replaced the Vista Cruiser as the setting of the opening credits.  The stupid helmet [ edit ]  The stupid helmet refers to a replica of a Green Bay Packers helmet that a character is forced to wear after having done or said something deemed stupid by the rest of the gang. Eric had to wear it when he said he wanted to propose to Donna and Fez wore it when he started banging his head on the table after trying to help Kelso keep Jackie. The helmet can be seen in the Forman basement on a shelf behind the cast. When the series concluded in 2006, the last one up the staircase had to call Red a ""dumbass"", something he always called the kids. Since Kelso was the last one up, he grabbed the helmet.  The water tower [ edit ]  In many episodes, the teenaged characters often hang out on a local water tower. At the end of several water tower segments, at least one character falls off (usually Kelso). When Charlie Richardson (played by Bret Harrison) fell off and died in season 8, the water tower was renamed in his honor.  After Charlie's death, Kelso fell off again, but survived, leading him to believe he was ""invincible"". In the ""Water Tower episode"", the gang painted a marijuana leaf on the tower, but it looked more like a green hand giving the finger. In the episode ""The Immigrant Song (a.k.a. Fez Gets Busted)"" Kelso paints Jackie and his name on the tower to annoy Hyde just before falling and ending up in the hospital. During this episode, Fez paints his manhood on the tower but only gets as far as drawing a circle when the police arrive to arrest him. Kelso was known to fall off the water tower once in every grade since middle school. This is also where Eric proposes to Donna (""Hot Dog""), and where Jackie and Fez share their first official kiss in the show's finale.  Scene transitions [ edit ]  In the first season, scene transitions (also known as bumpers) consisted of animated smiley buttons[18] or still images of faces from the 1970s with only the mouth moving using Syncro-Vox, usually yelling, in a rock form, ""Yeahhh!"" or something similar (ex. Farrah Fawcett saying ""Yeah!"" or Richard Nixon saying ""Are you ready to rock and roll?"") The smiley buttons were removed for re-runs and home video, replaced with flowers likewise exploding, replicating, deflating or bouncing around. Sometimes they would be visuals of lava lamps with the show's logo plummeting to the bottom of the screen in front of it.  Beginning in season 2, transitions featured the characters doing something in front of a colorful, psychedelic, lava lamp-like background. These transitions featured the most prominent characters of the scene usually dancing, falling or making facial expressions. The music accompanying these colorful sequences would match the tone of the episode and characters.  By the show's final season, new transitions were created to accommodate cast changes (e.g. Donna's hair color, Leo continuing as a series regular and the insertion of Randy).  ""Nobody's Fault But Mine (2)"" is the only episode where Laurie Forman is featured in a transition. Tanya Roberts is the only regular actor not to be featured in a transition.  The Vista Cruiser [ edit ]  Many of the show's episodes featured Eric and the rest of the kids in or around Eric's ""Aztec Gold"" 1969 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser, handed down to Eric by Red. For the first seven seasons of the show, the show's introduction showed the cast inside the Vista Cruiser.  That particular station wagon was bought by Wilmer Valderrama at the show's conclusion from Carsey-Werner for ""no more than"" US$500.[19]  In August 2009, the show's Vista Cruiser was named third-greatest television car ever by MSN Autos.[20]  Running gags and catchphrases [ edit ]  In one of the show's major running gags, Red often threatens to punish Eric with many variations of catchphrase, ""kicking your ass"".[21] For example, in ""Kitty and Eric's Night Out"", Red mistakenly thinks Eric offended Kitty, so Red says, ""I swear I'll kick his ass!"" In ""Eric's Hot Cousin"", Eric tries to get out of something by claiming he's sleepwalking and Red says, ""And I'm about to be sleep-kicking your ass"", and, in ""Prank Day"", when Red gets covered in oatmeal, Eric tries to explain that it was just a prank that had gone ""horribly, horribly wrong"" Red says, ""Well, I have a prank, too. One where my foot doesn't plow through your ass. Let's hope it doesn't go horribly, horribly wrong!"" Several of the running gags were shown in edited clips for the series finale.  Some other notable running gags and catchphrases are:  Red's favorite insult is ""dumbass"", the origin of which is revealed in ""Halloween"". Ironically, Eric is the first character to say ""dumbass"" in ""Eric's Burger Job"". The insult is adopted by the whole gang and even occasionally by Kitty. Red regularly comes up with new choice insults such as ""kettlehead"" (which refers to Kelso).  Fez's country of origin is never revealed. Sometimes, Fez is about to disclose where he is from, or at least hint at it, but something happens to prevent him from doing so, like someone entering the room as seen in ""Stolen Car"", or Fez rambling in ""Love of My Life"".

Hyde would usually give Kelso a punch in the arm for either his stupidity or bad behavior.  Kelso yells ""Ow, my eye!"" when Hyde rough-houses with him. For example, in the episode ""Class Picture"", a series of flashbacks feature Hyde beating up Kelso. While the two are out of the immediate sight of the audience, Kelso yells, ""Ow, my eye!"" and the scene cuts to the next flashback. This gag is repeated several times throughout the series, although the only time Kelso appears with an injured eye is in ""Jackie's Cheese Squeeze"" after he was punched by Todd, Jackie's manager. On that occasion, Kelso did not yell, ""Ow, my eye!""

1634,"Beyonce is not upset with Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively about jokes made about the singer-songwriter in Marvel’s second installment of Deadpool.  Some tabloids contend that the “Crazy in Love” singer was not only angry with Ryan Reynolds for having made a rather innocuous joke in the film at her expense but even with his wife Blake Lively. At one point during the movie, Reynolds’ character tells another character: “In the words of Beyonce, please stop cheating on me.”  NW magazine reported that Beyonce, upset as she was with Reynolds for having made fun of her marital issues with Jay Z in the film, took an umbrage with Lively as well. This was reportedly because Beyonce felt that she had broken “girl code by not telling Ryan to think twice about poking fun at another woman being cheated on.”  The source quoted by NW magazine even went on to claim that Beyonce “thinks it’s cruel and certainly isn’t laughing.”  But if history is anything to go by, Beyonce has a great sense of humor and doesn’t get unhappy with every joke made at her expense. For example, as Gossip Cop reports, in October 2016, Saturday Night Live spoofed the music video of her song “Sorry” which had an implicit implication about Jay Z cheating on her. But despite the spoof, Beyonce attended the SNL after-party the following year with Jay Z invited as the musical guest.  Moreover, considering the nature of Ryan Reynolds’ character in the Deadpool series, where he is foul-mouthed and provides a running sort of social gag, it would be surprising if every celebrity he made fun of would begin to take offense with the jokes in the film. Tens of celebrities including Hugh Jackman, Matthew McConaughey, and Justin Bieber have all been laughed at in some way or the other in the sequel, but it is unlikely that these jokes would cause anything other than a chuckle or two.  As Reynolds himself noted, everyone who has been made fun of in Deadpool 2 understands what the intention of the makers really is.  “There’s a little bit of making fun, but I think everyone sees it for what it is, in the spirit of what it is. Most of the humor is really without teeth.”  So we can rest assured that unlike what has been falsely reported in tabloids, Beyonce is not actually upset with Reynolds or Lively over jabs in Deadpool 2. If anything, she might be upset with the tabloids for spreading false information.",fake
70,"PARIS (AP) - Actor Tom Cruise said he and girlfriend Katie Holmes are engaged, after he popped the question early Friday morning atop the Eiffel Tower.  Cruise, speaking at a Paris news conference with Holmes, said: ""Yes, I proposed to her.""  The couple often shared smiles as Cruise turned to look at her, with a massive diamond ring on her finger.  ""It was early this morning at the Eiffel Tower, so I haven't slept at all,"" he said. ""Today is a magnificent day for me, I'm engaged to a magnificent woman.""  Asked why he chose the famed Paris landmark, he said: ""I've never been to the Eiffel Tower. It's Paris, it's a beautiful city, it's very romantic.""  Cruise, 42, was in Paris to promote the French release of the Steven Spielberg film ""War of the Worlds"" next month.  He and 26-year-old Holmes went public with their romantic relationship in April. The two have faced repeated rumors of marriage. The relationship started after Cruise split from actress Penelope Cruz, and Holmes and actor Chris Klein called off their long-standing engagement.",fake
1181,"Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner announced they were breaking up in 2015, though they didn’t get around to filing for divorce until April 2017.  But soon after, Affleck more or less went public with his romance with Lindsay Shookus, a “Saturday Night Live” producer whom he may have started seeing when he was still married to Garner.  But three years after that initial 2015 announcement, Affleck and Garner, both 45, have yet to finalize their divorce, raising the question: What’s taking so long?  A new report by Us Weekly cites sources who say that the “Batman v. Superman” actor is dragging his feet because he would like to get back together with Garner, with whom he has three children.  If this description of Affleck is close to accurate, he could be the Oscar-winning, movie star version of “Bachelor” star Arie Luyendyk Jr., who angered Bachelor Nation and the rest of America by vacillating between two women in the show’s final episodes.  For her part, Garner really tried to make things work with Affleck — despite his reported struggles with alcohol addiction, gambling and monogamy, according to Us Weekly.  This fall, Affleck also had a dark cloud hanging over him following news about multiple sexual misconduct allegations against his regular producing collaborator Harvey Weinstein. In the wake of the Weinstein allegations and the launch of the #MeToo movement, Affleck was accused of groping two women and of being complicit in a Hollywood culture that allows sexually predatory men to stay in power.  After Garner and Affleck first announced their split in 2015, the “Alias” actress “put her heart and soul into fixing the relationship and wanted so desperately to turn things around for the children’s sake as well as theirs,” a source told Us Weekly.  “She forgave him for so much, and still he couldn’t change,” the source said.  In the year since they filed for divorce, Affleck begged Garner to come back several times, even after he had officially moved on with Shookus. “He had at one point been telling friends he wanted his ex back,” a source told the magazine.  Affleck apparently was saying such things even after he and Shookus started being photographed together in New York City or Los Angeles. In November, Affleck reportedly introduced Shookus to Garner as a step to getting her comfortable with his children, Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6. Affleck and Shookus also were spotted house-hunting together in the Los Angeles area over Valentine’s Day, various reports said.  Still, Affleck and Garner have continued to be seen in public together, attending church or taking the kids to school — though these joint appearances could simply be part of their vow to be hands-on co-parents.  The new Us Weekly report claims that there was a slim chance that the two could have reconciled in late 2017, after Affleck returned to rehab and re-dedicated himself to his recovery.  According to reports in November, two-time rehab veteran Affleck realized he was “losing his grip on his alcohol addiction.”  Affleck poured out his heart to Garner, “telling her everything that was going on with his life,” a source told Us Weekly at the time. “After everything they’ve been through, she is going to continue to be there for him when he needs her,” the source told Us Weekly in November. “No matter what the circumstances.”  Those circumstances include all the “smoking and drinking and gambling” that apparently took place during the marriage — as well as Affleck possibly cheating on Garner with Shookus when they were married and reportedly dating their children’s 28-year-old nanny Christine Ouzounian after they first announced their split in 2015.  The new Us Weekly report said that Garner visited her estranged husband every day while he was in rehab.  “They did family counseling to work on their relationship,” an insider told the magazine. “Things looked positive. Jennifer was very caring, very present. They both wanted it to work.”  But another source told Us Weekly that Affleck is, in fact, ready to move on and be with Shookus, whom he “loves and adores.”  Certainly, geography could make that relationship challenging as Shookus lives in New York City, where she works and raises a son, while Affleck is committed to being close to his children, who are based in Los Angeles.  The website Gossip Cop quoted other sources “close” to the couple who slammed the Us Weekly report, saying that the story actually makes clear that the two aren’t reuniting, but teases the idea that they might. A contact close to the situation told Gossip Cop: “(The cover) is not true. There’s no reconciliation and they are in (the middle of) finalizing the divorce.”  Another friend of Affleck and Garner told Gossip Cop that the exes are “both working hard to create the best relationship for the kids.”  Indeed, the Us Weekly story said that Garner has quietly begun dating again, though that included going out with a man who is described as looking something like Affleck.  “Jen is ready to go with her feelings and give love another try,” a friend told Us Weekly.

Things looked like they improved last year, but a new snag might put their divorce settlement on hold once again.  Pitt and Jolie announced their split back in the summer of 2016. At the time, Jolie took their six kids and struck out on her own. Pitt, meanwhile, was forced to confront several different scandals, including accusations of child abuse. After the mudslinging stopped and the two started communicating again, it seemed as though Pitt and Jolie were on the verge of finalizing the divorce and moving on.  While they have been close to signing the divorce papers, two big issues keep preventing them from coming to an agreement.  ? #BradPitt yesterday along with many A-listers attended a U2 concert in LA? his new look is his 2010-2011 look❤️his body & face looks healthier than last year and his hair is just ??

Pitt is fighting for joint legal and physical custody of the brood while Jolie wants all of it. Unless Jolie changes her mind soon, the issue could be left for the courts to decide.

Jolie desperately wants to sell the estate and split the profits, but Pitt isn’t about to give up his dreams of making wine.  “Brad has really loved renovating the buildings on the grounds and working with the vintner and olive oil maker,” the insider explained, adding that Pitt is present for each harvest and wants to keep the chateau’s legacy intact.

19431,"Former NFL quarterback Jay Cutler and reality-TV star Kristin Cavallari are selling their massive estate in Nashville for just under $8 million. The sprawling hilltop home will serve as the backdrop for the couple's upcoming reality-TV show, ""Very Cavallari,"" premiering on E! on July 8.  The superstylish mansion offers seven bedrooms, seven full baths, and three half bathrooms spread across just under 20,000 square feet. Built in 2007, the Mediterranean-style villa sits on 8.5 wooded acres, offering seclusion as well as breathtaking views. The duo purchased the home in 2012 for $5.3 million.

Now that she is a wife and mother, her new show chronicles all the behind-the-scenes drama of her latest venture, a lifestyle and jewelry brand based in Nashville called Uncommon James.  Across all of its massive 25 rooms, the estate reflects the brand's style—just a little bit rustic, while remaining cool and refined.  The show's trailer features the celeb couple at home in the mansion.  Cutler and Cavallari were married five years ago and have three children. After Cutler was released by the Chicago Bears after eight seasons with the team, the family settled in Nashville. The couple were thrown for a bit of a loop with the sale of their Chicago-area home. Listed for $4.75 million in June 2017, the Illinois home sold in November for $3.6 million.  No word on why Cutler and Cavallari have decided to sell their Nashville digs, but according to the Tennessean, they plan to relocate to another home in the area. Perhaps after being featured on their series, the couple is concerned about security.  “This house has a lot to offer,” Cutler told the Tennessean. “We have a lot of memories in that house, and we will miss it. We got married and had three children since we have owned that house, so it’s been a huge part of our life, and hopefully someone will enjoy it as much as we have.”  With a new home on the horizon, it sounds as if the team at Uncommon James are about to get a whole new project.",real

A rep for the actress confirmed to ABC News that “The Hunger Games"" star was leaving her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky on Saturday after visiting family.  While mid-flight at 31,000 feet, one of the private plane's engines failed, the rep confirmed, causing the pilots to make the emergency landing in Buffalo.  During the emergency landing, the plane’s second engine failed, the rep confirmed.  The FAA, which traditionally does not release the names of those on board flights, released a statement Sunday about the incident.  ""A Hawker Beechcraft B40 aircraft landed safely at Buffalo Niagara International Airport in New York at about 1:40 pm on Saturday,"" the statement read. ""The crew diverted to Buffalo when they declared an emergency due to engine-related issues. The flight was heading to Teterboro Airport in New Jersey from Louisville, Kentucky.""

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  But what was real and what was just for show? Here’s a breakdown of the show’s major plot points. And, it goes without saying, spoilers ahead!  True: Prince Charles Took William and Harry to Africa After Their Mother’s Death  The first scene opens with brothers Prince William and Prince Harry traveling through Africa with their father, Prince Charles, just after Princess Diana’s death. In real life, Charles brought his sons there to escape the glare of the spotlight following their mother’s death on August 30, 1997. It was a formative trip for Harry, who fell in love with Africa during that time. “I first came in 1997, straight after my mum died. My dad told my brother and me to pack our bags — we were going to Africa to get away from it all,” Harry told Town & Country in 2017. “This is where I feel more like myself than anywhere else in the world. I wish I could spend more time in Africa. I have this intense sense of complete relaxation and normality here.”  Image zoom Prince Philip, Prince William, Earl Spencer, Prince Harry and Prince Charles walk outside Westminster Abbey during the funeral service for Princess Diana JEFF J. MITCHELL/AFP/Getty  False: Prince Harry Was Deep Into the Party Scene Just Before Meeting Meghan  While it’s true that he was known as the party prince during his 20s, his partying days were well behind him by the time he met Meghan in 2016. In 2005, Harry’s picture was splashed on front pages around the world showing the then-20-year-old wearing a Nazi uniform at a costume party. He made headlines again after naked photos emerged from his strip billiards game in Las Vegas in 2012. But after retiring from the Army in 2015 after 10 years of service, Harry had reformed his wild ways. And he was ready to find love and settle down. “Harry’s drinking days are over,” a source told PEOPLE. “All of his best friends have settled and had children, so he’s had fewer people to go out and play with. He realized he was getting a bit older and that it was time to settle down a little bit.” Adds Duncan Larcombe, a former royals reporter who traveled with Prince Harry throughout much of the early 2000s: “He desperately wanted to get married and be happy. He sees his brother has found that. The fact that Meghan arrived when she did completes it for Harry.”  Image zoom Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance Lifetime  Image zoom Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Owen Humphreys/PA Wire/AP  True: Meghan Took Issue with an Ivory Soap Commercial  The scene where Meghan was offended by a soap commercial geared towards women rings true. Meghan was inspired to change a TV commercial at the age of 11, after seeing a Procter & Gamble commercial that advertised its Ivory dishwashing soap solely to women. The commercial for the soap struck her as unfair and insensitive when she heard, “women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans.” Meghan’s social studies class had been assigned to watch commercials and assess them. The assignment led to a monumental moment for the future royal. Meghan decided to write to the company and asked them to change their slogan from “Women all over America” to “People all over America.” And her efforts paid off. The commercial aired on TV again, this time with the slogan, “People are fighting greasy pots and pans with Ivory care.” About 20 years after seeing the commercial, Meghan gave a speech about the moment at the United Nations, saying, “I remember feeling shocked and angry and also just feeling so hurt. It just wasn’t right and something needed to be done.  RELATED VIDEO: Harry and Meghan Confirm They Will Uphold a ‘Very Important’ Tradition Involving the Wedding Dress!  True: Meghan and Harry Were Set Up on a Blind Date  The newly-engaged couple revealed that they were set up on a blind date in July 2016 and knew very little about each other before they met. “It was definitely a set-up — it was a blind date,” Harry said during the couple’s revealing engagement interview. “It was a blind date for sure.” And as is shown in the movie, Meghan did ask their matchmaker whether Harry was “nice.” “I didn’t know much about him. And so the only thing that I had asked her when said she wanted to set us up was – I had one question, I said, ‘Well, is he nice?’ Because if he wasn’t kind it just didn’t – it didn’t seem like it would make sense,” Meghan said during their interview.  True: One of Their First Dates Was a Trip to Botswana  Unlike what was depicted in the movie, Meghan didn’t spend three days waiting for Harry to call her. In real life, Meghan and Harry’s first date was quickly followed by two back-to-back dates in London, so he was already on speed-dial by that point! But after those initial dates, they did travel together to Botswana. “It was I think about three, maybe four weeks later that I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana,” Harry said of their whirlwind romance. “And we camped out with each other under the stars. She came and joined me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic. So then we were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure that we had a chance to know each other.”  Image zoom Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance Lifetime  Image zoom Prince Harry in Botswana Rhino Conservation Botswana/ Kensington Palace/Getty  False: Will and Kate Cautioned Harry About Dating Meghan  In the movie, Prince William and Kate Middleton aren’t overly supportive of Harry dating Meghan in the beginning and they express their concern over her background. But Meghan’s future in-laws have always been in the couple’s corner. “She’s been wonderful,” Meghan said of Kate after the couple’s engagement. Harry added: “Amazing, as has William as well, you know, fantastic support.” Meghan, who will be learning on the job, “is funny and serious and extremely hard-working,” a source close to the former Suits star told PEOPLE. “I can imagine Kate will find a great friend in her.”  Image zoom Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance Lifetime  Image zoom Chris Jackson/Getty Images  False: Meghan Wasn’t Invited to Pippa Middleton’s Wedding Reception  While it’s true that Meghan didn’t receive an invite to Pippa’s wedding ceremony, she was invited to the black-tie reception that followed. Following the ceremony, a source told PEOPLE that Harry would travel back to London to pick Meghan up for the wedding reception in Bucklebury. The royal was spotted driving after the post-church Englefield House party. The fact that she did attend the wedding — even if it was the post-church nighttime bash — was yet another sign that the Suits actress and the prince were getting more and more serious.  True: A Royal Relative Wore an Offensive Brooch  While it didn’t happen at Pippa’s wedding as depicted in the movie, a royal relative did wear an offensive brooch to the Queen’s annual Christmas lunch, which was attended by Meghan in December 2017. Princess Michael of Kent, the wife of the Queen’s first cousin, was pictured arriving at Buckingham Palace wearing a brooch on her left shoulder which appeared to be “blackamoor” jewelry, depicting the bust of a black person with a gold crown and colorful crystals. The brooch drew further criticism due to Meghan’s biracial background (her mother is Black and her father is white) — and the fact that Princess Michael chose to wear it on the day Meghan was being introduced to many extended royal family members for the first time. Princess Michael of Kent released a statement following the incident that read: “The brooch was a gift and has been worn many times before. Princess Michael is very sorry and distressed that it has caused offense.”  Image zoom Princess Michael of Kent Mark Cuthbert/UK Press/Getty  True: Harry and Meghan Wore Matching Bracelets  Just like in the movie, Harry did give Meghan a bracelet that matched his own. The couple started sporting “his and hers” jewelry early on in their relationship. They were spotted wearing the same blue beaded bracelet on several occasions. Prince Harry reportedly picked up the bracelet during one of his trips to Africa. And the gift rarely left the actress’s wrist! She even posted several photos on her now-deleted Instagram account showing off her sweet trinket.  Image zoom Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty; Megan Markle/Instagram  True: Meghan Met the Queen  During Meghan and Prince Harry’s revealing engagement interview, the couple revealed that the L.A.-born actress had not only met the Queen a couple times already, she also immediately won over her dogs. “It’s incredible,” Meghan said about meeting the Queen. “To be able to meet her through his lens, not just with his honor and respect for her as Monarch, but with the love he has for her as his grandmother. She’s an incredible woman.” Harry then added: “The corgis took to her straight away. ‘I’ve spent the last 33 years being barked at — this one walks in, absolutely nothing.” And Meghan, who has two dogs herself, replied: “They were laying on my feet during tea!”  False: Harry’s Public Statement Led to a Breakup  While the movie insinuates that Meghan was in the dark about Harry’s rare public statement in November 2016 that confirmed that he was dating the actress and slammed what he called the racist and sexist abuse she had endured since their relationship was revealed, Meghan was most likely fully supportive of that decision. And it didn’t lead to a brief breakup as was depicted in the movie. Since it was such a rare move for a royal family member to release a statement about their private life, Meghan would have been briefed about the statement at length before it was released.  Image zoom Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance Lifetime  Image zoom Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Alexi Lubomirski/REX/Shutterstock  False: A Member of Harry’s Inner Circle Tried to Intimidate Meghan  The character of Annabella, played by Marlie Collins, doesn’t exist in real life. But the royal interloper, who chided Meghan about her TV career, biracial background and even her biological clock, did represent a lot of the criticism the couple was facing when they took their relationship public.  True: Meghan’s Ex-Husband Is Producing a Show Based on Her Relationship with Prince Harry  Trevor Engelson, Meghan’s ex-husband, is producing an as-of-yet-untitled show with a premise that sounds awfully familiar — because it’s based on his own relationship with Meghan, and her relationship with Prince Harry. The description of the show reads: “Divorce is hard. Sharing custody is harder. Sharing custody with the British Royal family when your wife marries a prince, in the unforgiving spotlight of London’s tabloid media, is next level,” according to Deadline. The idea came to be during a discussion between Engelson — who also works on FX’s Snowfall — and Dan Farah, another one of the show’s producers, where they imagined what life would have been like if Engelson and Markle had children, and he potentially had to share custody (and all the associated drama) with the royal family. Though the basis of the show was hatched from reality, Deadline does add that, “It should be noted that the comedy is fictional, the lead characters are not based on Markle or Engelson, who have no kids together, and she has had no involvement in the project.”  Image zoom Queen Charlotte Indianapolis Museum of Art /Getty Images  True: Meghan Is Not the First Biracial Royal  Although it’s doubtful that the Queen showed Meghan a portrait of Queen Charlotte, a biracial royal, during her palace visit, she is, in fact, a real royal. Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was married to King George III and was queen for nearly 60 years, until she died in 1818. She’s the grandmother of Queen Victoria and the great-great-great-great-grandmother of the current Queen Elizabeth. Though she was born in Germany, the daughter of a Duke, Queen Charlotte was directly descended from Margarita de Castro y Sousa, which was the black branch of the Portuguese Royal House. Her racial background wasn’t known to the public when she served as queen. It was only discovered many years after her death, thanks to art historians who studied portraits of Charlotte more closely.",real

8058,"A judge has ordered DMX to be on house arrest with an ankle monitor after he violated the conditions of his bail by failing drug tests. The rapper also left the state of New York without getting permission from the court.  A representative for the U.S. Attorney’s Office said since his arrest for tax evasion, the rapper tested positive for cocaine not once, but four times, and was caught with marijuana in his system twice.  The representative added DMX claimed he could be drug-free on his own after the government offered him to take drug addiction counseling.  Also, in July, authorities contacted the rapper, and he told them he was in Chicago.  Not long after, he traveled to St. Louis to deal with a “family emergency.”  Unfortunately, for the rapper, this trip to St. Louis might leave him with jail-time, as leaving the state when the government tells you not to is a big no-no.  As CI readers know, he was charged with tax evasion and fraud and could be convicted for more than 40 years if he’s hit with all the counts.  The rapper has not come out to comment publicly.  According to reports, he is, suspected of, “engaging in a multi-year scheme to conceal millions of dollars of income from the IRS and to avoid paying $1,7 million of tax liabilities.”  U.S. Attorney, Joon H.

Far from it, DMX allegedly went out of his way to evade taxes, including by avoiding personal bank accounts, setting up accounts in other’s names and paying personal expenses largely in cash.” It looks like the rapper is in serious trouble, as deliberately avoiding taxes is a serious crime in almost every developed nation.",real

Kim, on the other hand, is expecting her third baby via surrogate. And get this – they all are due around the same time next year! Could this really be just a really smart, orchestrated move? Or are the claims just baseless rumours?  ""Kris knew having three daughters simultaneously expecting would bring drama, tears, attention, competition — everything she's trying to sustain for the sake of bigger paydays,"" an insider reported Star magazine. As reported by Star, the ratings of KUWTK were down last season. Is this Kris Jenner's extremely well-crafted revival strategy?  ""All three sisters have been promised endorsement deals, TV specials and even books. They're looking forward to majorly cashing in and breathing new life into their careers,"" the source said. Clearly, as Kris seemed to have been convinced, the triple baby boom news is doing its bit, if the source's claims are authentic.  ""She can't wait for all the attention,"" the source continues to explain. ""But, more importantly, for the cash to start rolling in."" This clearly refers to the alleged $25 million that the Kardashian-Jenner women are reportedly making off the baby news announcement and deals that have been offered to them.  Guess it's safe to conclude that this tweet stands proven right!  Like they say...the devil works hard but Kris Jenner works harder. https://t.co/CsSApFoErx pic.twitter.com/aNYyH3qny9 — Yashar Ali ? (@yashar) September 30, 2017  ""These sisters have everything to lose, so it's worth doing anything they can to keep ratings up and storylines fresh,"" revealed the insider. ""And that includes triple pregnancies."" Well, while neither of them confirmed their pregnancy rumours except for Kim, the sisters were spotted in baggy attire recently.  And they might have dropped some passive hints on their social media accounts too! While sources have confirmed to multiple entertainment magazines that the rumours are true and the pregnant couples are absolutely thrilled, could this be just another stunt they pulled for money? Will they actually do that?  We all know that Kim's first choice for her surrogate was Khloe, and it was then revealed that the latter has fertility issues. Kylie, on the other hand, is the youngest and at the peak of her make-up mogul career. Would they consciously, strategically ""plan"" and make it happen?  Knowing Kris Jenner, anything is possible, but given Khloe's history and Kylie's relationship term with Travis Scott, it sounds a little strange that all of them would just agree on a whim and control the entire process.  Like, this has to be considered..  Their mama is not the fertile queen regardless all three can take care of them babies financially A baby is a blessing all day — Sollatina (@sollatina) September 27, 2017  And no matter how much the younger sisters seem to have ""timed their pregnancies to coincide with Kim's,"" this just seems way too biologically advanced.

17428,"Kanye West shocked fans when he publicly shared longterm friend John Legend's private text messages on Twitter.  But within minutes on Thursday morning, Kim Kardashian was attempting to defuse the situation, with the help of her BFF Chrissy Teigen, aka Mrs John Legend.  The two swiftly put a jokey spin on Kanye's decision to share John's personal message, in which he firmly but kindly rebuked Kanye for his support of Donald Trump.  Kim Kardashian enlists Chrissy Teigen to defuse Kanye West's John Legend tweets... and BFFs take to Twitter to arrange phone-free dinner party  Chrissy got the ball rolling when she tweeted: 'Kim Kardashian are we still doing dinner Friday or no lol?'  Kim swiftly replied: 'Yes but maybe no phones', adding a series of laughing emoticons, along with four crossed out phones.  Adding the final punchline, Chrissy then replied to Kim's tweet with the sarcastic 'Can I bring my friend Scott Baio? He's super chill.'  Baio is infamously a Trump supporter.  Got her back: Chrissy reached out to Kim; the two are seen together in 2015  Chrissy and Kim banded together with their damage control attempt, afterKanye posted a personal text exchange with friend John Legend in which he accused the singer of 'manipulating my free thought.'  The 40-year-old rapper - who has had a longstanding friendship with the 39-year-old Ordinary People hitmaker - took to Twitter to share a screenshot of their conversation.  John began the message by urging the Famous hitmaker to 'reconsider aligning yourself with Trump.'  No phones allowed! Chrissy and Kim banded together with their damage control attempt, after Kanye posted a personal text exchange with friend John Legend in which he accused the singer of 'manipulating my free thought'  However Kanye was not very receptive for what the Oscar winner had to say as he wrote a biting response, screenshotted the conversation, and posted it online just minutes later.  It came after Kanye made waves on social media on Wednesday as he voiced his support for President Donald Trump during a lengthy Twitter tirade.  John has been very vocal about his distaste for the 45th president and reached out to his pal about the matter as he wrote: 'Hey it's JL. I hope you'll reconsider aligning yourself with Trump.  'You're way too powerful and influential to endorse who he is and what he stands for. As you know, what you say really means something to your fans.  Ouch: Kanye West took to Twitter to share a personal conversation between he and John Legend in which he accused the singer of 'manipulating my free thought', as they are pictured together at the MTV Video Music Awards in Los Angeles in August 2015  Tough times: The 40-year-old rapper - who has had a longstanding friendship with the 39-year-old Ordinary People hitmaker - took to Twitter once again to share a screenshot of their conversation  'They are loyal to you and respect your opinion. So many people who love you feel so betrayed right now because they know the harm that Trump's policies cause, especially to people of color.  'Don't let this be part of your legacy. You're the greatest artist of our generation.'  However Kanye remained steadfast despite his close friend's pleas.  He wrote back: 'I love you John and I appreciate your thoughts. You bringing up my fans or my legacy is a tactic based on fear used to manipulate my free thought.'  'Think freely': It did not end there as Kanye posted the continuation of their conversation  Longtime pals: Kanye and John pictured together at Stevie Wonder's birthday back in May 2007  It did not end there as Kanye posted the continuation of their conversation as John urged him to: 'Think freely. Think with empathy and context too. Your words and actions have consequences. Much love.'  John even poked fun at Kanye for posting their private messages on the popular micro-blogging site as he took the opportunity to plug his latest track called A Good Night.  The talented crooner wrote: 'And since you're posting texts, let me add that I have a new single out haha'  Kanye explained why he made the decision to post their text thread to show that there was a contentious but respectful discourse between the two of them.  Interesting take: Kanye explained why he made the decision to post their text thread to show that there was a contentious but respectful discourse between the two of them  He said: 'I tweeted the John text to show that there are people around me that disagree with me and voice their opinion. I respect everyone's opinion but I stand my ground.'  He went on to explain that he wanted to show people that he was empathetic as empathy isn't the first thing people think when it comes to a Trump supporter.  Kanye wrote: 'I really appreciate this dialogue with John Legend because I'm actually very empathetic. Im still the kid from the telethon. I feel when people think of MAGA they don't think of empathy.'  The 'telethon' the All Of The Lights hitmaker seemed to be referring to was the infamous live TV Hurricane Katrina fundraiser in 2006 in which Kanye declared: 'George Bush don't care about black people.'  John's wife Chrissy Teigen referred to what was going on with Kanye as she insisted that if there is an issue with someone, the conversation goes to them directly and not social media.  Chiming in: John's wife Chrissy Teigen referred to what was going on with Kanye  The 32-year-old model wrote: 'Everyone keeps asking me to comment on s***. Comment on psycho Tami Lasagna, whom I refuse to give the joy to, say something about RHOA, speak up about kanye.  'When it comes to people we know, we DO speak up. To THEM. not on Twitter. And sometimes, I guess it makes it to Twitter.'  As John and Kanye have a tight-knit relationship, their wives Kim and Chrissy do too and they also hit Twitter to poke fun at the awkward situation.  On Wednesday Kanye voiced his support for Donald Trump and even shared a selfie while wearing a Making America Great Again hat.  'Maybe no phones': As John and Kanye have a tight-knit relationship, their wives Kim and Chrissy do too and they also hit Twitter to poke fun at the awkward situation  John took umbrage with the series of post as he shared his thoughts to counter his longtime friend.  'The defining trait of Trump's campaign and political profile was his embrace of white supremacy. He made it clear every time he spoke,' the Green Light hitmaker tweeted.  'Some serious cognitive dissonance to ignore that for the other x% you might find appealing. I guess I agree with >1% of anyone's thoughts though,' he added.  The Glory singer earlier also posted a series of tweets critical of West's support of Trump.  Legend tweeted that he imagines 'there's some comfort in imagining a future without racism and projecting that onto the present. Thinking if we just deny the truth, it doesn't exist. If history is erased, we don't have to deal with its consequences.'  Defining trait: On Wednesday Legend tweeted that the 'defining trait of Trump's campaign and political profile was his embrace of white supremacy' in response to Kanye's pro-Trump tweets  Blind artist: The Glory singer that 'artists can't be blind to the truth'  He added, however, that 'far too many people don't have the luxury of closing their eyes and ears. They feel it in their lives and can't act like what they see and know doesn't exist.  'They know their family was destroyed by deportation or incarceration. They know their loved one was denied safe harbor because of their religion. They know their son or daughter was shot because their skin color evoked fear.  'They see the statistics about black applications for real estate or loans or employment being turned away because their name was Jamal and not James  'I love that great, brilliant artists have the power to imagine a better future. But artists can't be blind to the truth,' he concluded.  Kim also apparently lambasted Kanye over it as he tweeted: 'my wife just called me and she wanted me to make this clear to everyone.  'I don't agree with everything Trump does. I don't agree 100% with anyone but myself.'  Kim had was very vocal in her support of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race.  Before that Kanye wrote: 'You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.'  The Through The Wire hitmaker did make sure to urge fans to not follow what everyone else does and that regardless of his Trump support, he is also a fan of Hillary.  He explained: 'If your friend jumps off the bridge you don't have to do the same. Ye being Ye is a fight for you to be you. For people In my life the idea of Trump is pretty much a 50 50 split but I don't tell a Hillary supporter not to support Hillary I love Hillary too.'  'We got love': Kanye shocked many of his followers as he posted a picture of himself wearing a Make America Great Again hat  'She wanted me to make this clear to everyone': On Wednesday, Kim apparently lambasted Kanye as the rapper later tweeted about her calling him over his Donald Trump remarks  MAGA: Kanye had once again voiced his support for the POTUS which seemingly led to Kim's call  Kim went on to defend Kanye's rant in a series of tweets which began: 'To the media trying to demonize my husband let me just say this... your commentary on Kanye being erratic & his tweets being disturbing is actually scary. So quick to label him as having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive is not fair.'  She was upset about the previous stories published in regard to Kanye's mental health being called into question.  The reality star continued: 'He’s a free thinker, is that not allowed in America? Because some of his ideas differ from yours you have to throw in the mental health card? That’s just not fair. He’s actually out of the sunken place when he’s being himself which is very expressive.'  Odd couple: West, shown with Trump in December 2016 in New York City, tweeted that 'the mob can't make me not love him' while also calling him his 'brother'  'He never said he agrees with his politics': She also urged people to respect his political beliefs even if they have differing opinions including her  Hitting back: Kim went on to defend Kanye's rant in a series of tweets as she said 'your commentary on Kanye being erratic & his tweets being disturbing is actually scary'  She also urged people to respect his political beliefs even if they have differing opinions including her.  Kim wrote: 'Now when he spoke out about Trump... Most people (including myself) have very different feelings & opinions about this. But this is HIS opinion. I believe in people being able to have their own opinions,even if really different from mine He never said he agrees with his politics.'  She finished off her own tweet storm by saying that she knows that Kanye will never be the most popular person but thats why he's liked and respected finishing off by saying 'Kanye is ahead of his time.'  Donald Trump later retweeted Kanye's words about him adding: 'Thank you Kanye, very cool!'

1432,"Jennifer Aniston Should Just Follow 'Friends' To Get Over Her Justin Theroux Split  By Sam Lucas  Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux have announced their split, but we reckon Jen will do just fine getting over her ex, by taking a few tips from Rachel from Friends...  After two years of marriage, Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux have called it quits. Though rather than wallowing in self-depression and feeling unlucky in love, we have no doubt, that Jen will be getting over Justin in true Rachel from Friends style, and here’s how…  She’ll keep reminding herself about the reason she ended it  The best way to get over an ex is to strip back all the good times you spent together and remember the reason you broke up. Whilst Justin Theroux might not have cheated, there’s no doubt a good reason why they chose to call it quits after two years of marriage. The more Jen remembers the reason, the easier it will be to move on.  Partake in an epic girls night...  A boozy girls night in can work as the perfect healer. Whilst doing this in wedding dresses, like Monica, Phoebe and Rachel might not be the healthiest way to go, Jennifer knows all too well that getting your friends to perk you up is a great reminder that things are going to be ok.  A night out on the town also, never hurts...  Dancing away your troubles IS a thing. Jen just needs to call on Courtney Cox (who amazingly is is her bestie in real life!) and dance like no one’s watching.  Eat good food!  Going through a break up is one of the few times you can eat until your heart is content and not feel guilty about it!  She'll make sure it really is over  We all know what being on a break did to Ross and Rachel. The best thing Jen can do is, make sure it’s a solid decision and not go back on it. Being on a break is way too complicated.  Celebrate Jennifer!  As an award-winning actress, there’s no better time just for Jennifer to just sit back, celebrate her achievements and what is yet to come. It’s all about enjoying some ‘me’ time, working on the next steps and celebrating your independence.  Move on to the next...  She’s a free agent again, and she’s Jennifer Aniston, which technically means she can get anyone she likes. Getting over a break-up is so much easier when someone else is showing you attention - that way you know you’ve still got it. Once the dust has settled, it's time to move on Jen. Good luck!",fake

15178,"This article is about the American football player. For other people named Tom Brady, see Tom Brady (disambiguation)  American football quarterback  Thomas Edward Patrick Brady Jr. (born August 3, 1977) is an American football quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL). He spent the first 20 seasons of his career with the New England Patriots, playing in nine Super Bowls and winning six of them (XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX, XLIX, LI, and LIII), both of which are the most of any player in NFL history. He has won a record four Super Bowl MVP awards (XXXVI, XXXVIII, XLIX, and LI) as well as three NFL MVP awards (2007, 2010, 2017).[a] Because of his numerous records and accolades, many sports writers, commentators, and players consider Brady to be the greatest quarterback of all time.[2][3][4][5][6][7]  After playing college football for the University of Michigan, Brady was drafted 199th overall by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft. Due to his late selection, Brady is considered the biggest ""steal"" in the history of the NFL Draft.[8][9][10] He went on to become the team's starting quarterback in his second season after an injury to Drew Bledsoe and played for the Patriots for 20 seasons, the NFL record for seasons as quarterback for one team.[b] Following the 2019 season, Brady left New England and signed a two-year deal with the Buccaneers.  Brady is one of only two quarterbacks to win a Super Bowl in their first season as a starter.[c] He is also the only quarterback to reach 200 regular-season wins,[14] Brady has never had a losing season as a starting quarterback. He has led his team to more division titles (17) than any other quarterback in NFL history. With a postseason record of 30–11, he is first all-time in playoff wins and appearances for an NFL player, including an NFL-record eight consecutive AFC championship games between 2011 and 2018 (and 13 overall). Brady has also been selected to 14 Pro Bowls, which ties the NFL record for most selections. For regular season and postseason combined, Brady is first all-time in career passing yards and touchdown passes. He is one of only two players in NFL history to amass 70,000 passing yards and 1,000 rushing yards.[d]  Brady is second all-time in career regular season passing yards, second in career touchdown passes, and tied for fifth in career passer rating. He is first in postseason career completions, passing yards, and passing touchdowns, and is fifteenth in postseason career passer rating. He also tied the record for the longest touchdown pass at 99 yards to Wes Welker.[16] He is the only quarterback in NFL history named to two all-decade teams[17], having been named first-team for both the 2000 and 2010 squads (the latter of which he was selected to unanimously). He was one of only 10 quarterbacks selected to the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time team (and one of only four players active at the time they were selected), encompassing the entire 100-year history of the league at the time.  For his alleged involvement in the Deflategate football-tampering scandal, Brady was suspended for the first four games of the 2016 season.[18] Brady and the Patriots won two of the next three Super Bowls, making him the record holder for most Super Bowl wins by a player, and the oldest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, at 41.[19]  Early life  Thomas Edward Patrick Brady Jr. was born in San Mateo, California on August 3, 1977, the only son and fourth child of Galynn Patricia (née Johnson) and Thomas Brady Sr.[20] He has three older sisters, Nancy, Julie, and Maureen,[21] and was raised as a Catholic. His father is of Irish descent, while his mother has German, Norwegian, Polish, and Swedish ancestry.[22] Two of Brady's great-great-grandparents on his father's side, John and Bridget Brady, were Irish refugees from the Great Famine who moved to San Francisco from Boston before the American Civil War. They were accompanied by Bridget's sister Ann and her husband Lawrence Meegan, the parents of the 19th-century American Major League Baseball player ""Steady"" Pete Meegan. Brady's great-uncle Michael Buckley Jr. was the first American prisoner of war in World War II.[22][23][24][25][26][27]  In the 1980s, Brady regularly attended San Francisco 49ers games at Candlestick Park, where he was a fan of quarterback Joe Montana; Brady has called Montana his idol and one of his inspirations.[28] At age four, Brady attended the 1981 NFC Championship, against the Dallas Cowboys, in which Montana threw The Catch to Dwight Clark.[29] As a child, Brady attended football camp at the College of San Mateo, where he was taught to throw the football by camp counselor and future NFL/AFL quarterback Tony Graziani.[30] Despite the rivalry between both teams, Brady grew up as a Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics fan.[31]  Brady attended Junípero Serra High School in San Mateo, where he graduated in 1995; the ceremony was held at St. Mary's Cathedral.[32] He played football, basketball, and baseball in high school. He played against Bellarmine College Preparatory rival Pat Burrell in both football and baseball.[33] Brady began his football career as the backup quarterback on the Padres junior varsity team. At first, Brady was not good enough to start on the 0–8 JV team, which had not scored a touchdown all year.[34] Brady ascended to the starting position when the starting quarterback was injured. He became the varsity starter in his junior year and held the position until he graduated.[35] By Brady's senior year, he was striving to be noticed by college coaches. He created highlight tapes and sent them to schools he considered attending.[36] This led to strong interest from many football programs around the nation.  The process of recruiting was much different during Brady's time, and athletes' rankings were not as prominent. In terms of recruiting in the 2000s, Brady would have been considered a four-star recruit. In essence, he was a highly rated prospect.[37] Brady was also on Blue Chip Illustrated as well as a Prep Football Report All-American selection.[38] After his recruiting process, he narrowed down his list to five schools.[39] ""Probably the ones that we did hear from and ultimately pared the list to were Cal–Berkeley, UCLA, USC, Michigan, and Illinois”, his father said.[39] As a Cal fan, his father hoped that Brady would attend the nearby Cal, where Brady was a silent commit, and that he would be able to watch his son play.[40][41]  Brady was also known as a great baseball player in high school.[42] He was a left-handed-batting catcher with power. His skills impressed MLB scouts, and he was drafted in the 18th round of the 1995 MLB Draft by the Montreal Expos.[34][43] The Expos projected Brady as a potential All-Star, and offered him money typical of that offered to a late second-round or early third-round pick.[44] Nevertheless, Brady was determined to play football at the next level. He was always more passionate about football; when he found that there was significant interest in him, he decided to take the road of football.[39] Brady was recruited by Michigan assistant Bill Harris, and he signed to play for the University of Michigan in 1995.[45][46] He finished his high-school football career by completing 236 of 447 passes for 3,702 yards and 31 touchdowns. He also won All-State and All-Far West honors and the team's Most Valuable Player Award.[38]  During the summers of 1998 and 1999, Brady was an intern at Merrill Lynch.[47] He was inducted into the Junípero Serra High School Hall of Fame in 2003, joining fellow Serra High graduates Barry Bonds, Lynn Swann, Gregg Jefferies, Jim Fregosi, and his older sister Maureen, among many others.[38] When Brady revisited two weeks after Super Bowl XLVI, in 2012, school administrators announced that they had named the football stadium Brady Family Stadium.[48]  College career  Brady played college football at the University of Michigan from 1995 to 1999.[49][50] He was a backup quarterback for his first two years, while teammate and future NFL quarterback Brian Griese led the 1997 Wolverines to an undefeated season, which was capped by a victory in the Rose Bowl and a share of the national championship.[51] When he enrolled at Michigan, Brady was seventh on the depth chart, and he had an intense struggle to get some playing time. At one point, Brady hired a sports psychologist to help him cope with frustration and anxiety, and even considered transferring to California.[52][53] He worked closely with assistant athletic director Greg Harden, who met with Brady every week to build his confidence and to maximize his performance on the field.[54] Brady told 60 Minutes in 2014: ""He will always be somebody I rely on for sound advice and mentorship. He has helped me with my own personal struggles in both athletics and in life. Greg really pushed me in a direction that I wasn't sure I could go.""[55]  Under Michigan head coach Lloyd Carr, Brady battled for the starting job with Drew Henson[50] and ultimately started every game in the 1998 and 1999 seasons. Brady was All-Big Ten honorable mention both seasons, and was the team captain in his senior year.  During his first full year as starter, he set new Michigan records for most pass attempts and completions in a season, for a total of 214.[56] He set a school record for completions in a 31–16 loss against Ohio State in 1998, a season in which Michigan shared the Big Ten Conference title.[57] Brady capped that season with a 45–31 win over Arkansas in the Citrus Bowl.  In the 1999 season, Brady had to once again hold off Henson for the starting job. The two players platooned during the season's first seven games, with Brady playing the first quarter, Henson the second and Carr then deciding upon a quarterback for the second half. The 1999 Michigan Wolverines started with a 5–0 record, including a 26–22 win over Notre Dame, and a road win against eventual powerhouse Wisconsin. Against Michigan State, Brady was not chosen to play the second half; however, he was reinserted into the game with Michigan down by 17 points, and he nearly led Michigan all the way back before losing 34–31.[59] After a 300-yard passing game the following week, Carr went exclusively with Brady for the remainder of the season. Brady went on to lead Michigan to multiple 4th-quarter comebacks, including a remarkable 31–27 win against Penn State, and leading them out of a close game against Indiana, 34–31, heading into the regular season's final game, winners of three straight, earning him the moniker of ""Comeback Kid"".[60]  Michigan concluded the regular season against Ohio State; this was a dramatic game with a trip to the Orange Bowl on the line. With five minutes left, tied 17–17, Brady led Michigan to the winning score.[61] He led Michigan to an overtime win in the Orange Bowl over Alabama, throwing for 369 yards, four touchdowns, leading the team back from a pair of 14-point deficits in regulation (14–0 in the first half, and 28–14 in the second). He threw the game-winning score on a bootleg to tight end Shawn Thompson. Michigan won the game when Alabama missed an extra point following its own touchdown.[62][63]  In the two seasons that Brady started at Michigan, he posted a 20–5 record, including wins at the Citrus Bowl (1999) and the Orange Bowl (2000). Brady finished his career ranking third in Michigan history with 710 attempts and 442 completions, fourth with 5,351 yards and 62.3 completion percentage, and fifth with 35 touchdown passes.[38][64]  Statistics  College football statistics[65] Year Team Passing Rushing Cmp Att Pct Yds Y/A TD Int Rtg Att Yds Avg TD 1996 Michigan 3 5 60.0 26 5.2 0 1 63.7 — — — — 1997 Michigan 12 15 80.0 103 6.9 0 0 137.7 2 −14 −7.0 0 1998 Michigan 200 323 61.9 2,427 7.5 14 10 133.1 54 −105 −1.9 2 1999 Michigan 180 295 61.0 2,217 7.5 16 6 138.0 34 −31 −0.9 1 Career 395 638 61.9 4,773 7.5 30 17 134.9 90 −150 −1.7 3  Professional career  Overview  A lightly regarded prospect coming out of college,[68][69] Brady was selected by the New England Patriots with the 199th overall pick in the sixth round of 2000 NFL Draft and had since spent 20 seasons of his career with the Patriots. Brady's tenure with the Patriots is an NFL record for the longest time playing quarterback for one franchise. Despite his less-than-stellar physical abilities as seen at his NFL Scouting Combine performance,[70] Brady's success as a passer has been attributed to his work ethic, pocket awareness, and intelligence.[71]  Since Brady became their starting quarterback in 2001, the Patriots have never had a losing season and have won 17 division titles. The Patriots played in 13 AFC Championship Games from 2001 to 2018—including eight in a row from 2011 to 2018—and won nine of them. Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick have combined to form the most successful quarterback-head coach tandem in NFL history, winning more regular season games and postseason games than any other such duo[72] as well as appearing in nine Super Bowls. All of these events set new NFL records.[73]  In his second season, Brady took over as the starting quarterback after Drew Bledsoe was injured.[74] He led the Patriots to first place in the AFC East[75] and a victory over the favored St. Louis Rams[76][77] in Super Bowl XXXVI, winning his first Super Bowl MVP award. Despite the Patriots' missing the playoffs the following season, Brady would then lead them to back-to-back Super Bowl championships in 2003 and 2004, winning Super Bowl MVP honors again in 2003. Along the way, the Patriots won an NFL-record 21 consecutive games (including the playoffs) between the 2003 and 2004 seasons.[78] The 2005 season was Brady's first to throw for 4,000 yards and lead the NFL in passing.[79] That postseason, Brady would win his 10th consecutive playoff game, another NFL postseason record.[80]  Although Brady and the Patriots continued to win often, they did not return to the Super Bowl until the 2007 season. That year, Brady not only set an NFL record with 50 touchdown passes[81] but he would also lead the Patriots to a 16–0 finish,[82] the first perfect regular-season record since the Miami Dolphins finished 14–0 in 1972.[83][84] Brady would win his first career NFL MVP Award, winning 49 out of 50 votes.[85] The Associated Press also named him Male Athlete of the Year, the first such award given to an NFL player since Joe Montana won it in 1989 and 1990.[86] However, the Patriots suffered their first Super Bowl loss with Brady as quarterback, dropping a 17–14 decision to the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII.[87]  Brady missed virtually the entire following season due to a knee injury in the season opener.[88] But he would come back strong in the 2009 season to be named the league's Comeback Player of the Year.[89] In 2010, Brady set the NFL record for consecutive passes without an interception (358)[90] and broke his own record for the highest season touchdown-to-interception ratio (among players who have started a full season) at 9:1, currently the third best TD:INT ratio for a single season by a quarterback.[91] Brady would win his second league MVP award with all 50 votes in his favor.[92] He was the first unanimous NFL MVP since Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor won the award in 1986.[93] He and Joe Montana are the only players in NFL history to win multiple NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP awards.[94][95] Brady was also named the top player by his peers in the first NFL Top 100 list, released in 2011.[96]  In the 2011 season, Brady led the Patriots to their first AFC Championship since 2007 and appeared in the Super Bowl for a fifth time; but the Patriots would lose again to the Giants.[97] Following AFC Championship Game losses in the following two seasons, Brady and the Patriots made their sixth trip to the Super Bowl after the 2014 season (Brady's 15th as a professional). There, he led the Patriots to a fourth-quarter comeback[98] over the defending champion Seattle Seahawks. He won his fourth Super Bowl trophy and was named Super Bowl MVP for the third time.[99]  Despite missing the first four games of the 2016 season, Brady would lead the Patriots to win 11 out of the 12 remaining regular season games (to finish 14–2) and two postseason games to make his seventh Super Bowl appearance. Brady and the Patriots would overcome a 28–3, 3rd quarter deficit against the Atlanta Falcons to force overtime, winning 34–28 to give Brady his fifth Super Bowl title.[100] He earned his fourth Super Bowl MVP award after setting title-game records for appearances, pass attempts, completions, passing yards and fourth-quarter comebacks.[101] In his eighth appearance, capping the 2017 season, Brady threw for 505 yards, setting a record for most passing yards in a Super Bowl, but the Patriots lost to the Philadelphia Eagles. The Patriots won Super Bowl LIII in 2018, earning Brady his sixth super bowl title, becoming the first player in history to have won six Super Bowls.[102]  Over his career, Brady has won three league MVP awards, six Super Bowls, and four Super Bowl MVP Awards. A 14-time Pro Bowler, Brady has also twice led the NFL in passing yards.[103][104] As of November 2017, he owns the third-highest career passer rating (97.9) among quarterbacks with at least 1,500 career passing attempts.[105] He has thrown for more passing yards and touchdowns than any other quarterback in NFL postseason history; he also has won more playoff games than any other quarterback. As a result of his highly successful career, Brady is rated among the greatest quarterbacks of all time.[106]  Brady's name has become associated with two NFL rules, which sports reporters have called the ""Brady rules"". One is the tuck rule that was in effect from 1999 through 2013.[107] The other is a rule about low hits enacted in 2009: ""A defender cannot initiate a roll or lunge and forcibly hit the passer in the knee area or below, even if he is being contacted by another player.""[108]  New England Patriots  2000 season: Rookie year  Brady was selected with pick number 199, a compensatory pick, in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft.[109] He and his family had believed that Brady would be drafted in the second or third round; they watched the draft on television, stunned as six other quarterbacks were drafted before he was. Brady was so embarrassed that he briefly left the family home during the sixth round, and cried when recalling the experience for an interview 11 years later. When the Patriots notified him that he would be drafted, Brady was grateful that, he later said, he would not ""have to be an insurance salesman"".[110] According to Michael Holley's book Patriot Reign, the Patriots were considering Brady and Tim Rattay, both of whom had received positive reviews from then-quarterbacks coach Dick Rehbein.[111] Ultimately, the Patriots front office chose Brady. Considering his subsequent success, many analysts have called Brady the best NFL draft pick of all time.[112][113][114][115] Patriots owner Robert Kraft recalled: ""I still have the image of Tom Brady coming down the old Foxboro Stadium steps with that pizza box under his arm, a skinny beanpole, and when he introduced himself to me and said 'Hi Mr. Kraft,' he was about to say who he was, but I said 'I know who you are, you're Tom Brady. You're our sixth round draft choice,'"" recalled Kraft. ""And he looked me in the eye and said 'I'm the best decision this organization has ever made.' It looks like he could be right.""[116]  Brady started the season as the fourth-string quarterback, behind starter Drew Bledsoe and backups John Friesz and Michael Bishop; by season's end, he was number two on the depth chart behind Bledsoe.[117] During his rookie season, he was 1-for-3 passing, for six yards.[118] Tight end Rod Rutledge caught Brady's first and only completed pass of the season in a 34–9 loss to the Detroit Lions on November 23.[119][120]  2001 season  With Bledsoe as the starting quarterback, the Patriots opened the season with a 23–17 road loss to the Cincinnati Bengals.[118] In their second game and home opener on September 23, the Patriots squared off against their AFC East rivals, the New York Jets. Bledsoe was again the starter; in the fourth quarter, he suffered internal bleeding after a hit from Jets linebacker Mo Lewis. Bledsoe returned for the next series, but was replaced with Brady for the Patriots' final series of the game. Brady completed five of ten passes for 46 yards, but New York held on to win, 10–3, and the Patriots fell to 0–2 on the season.[121] Brady was named the starter for the season's third game, against the Indianapolis Colts. In his first two games as starter, Brady posted unspectacular passer ratings of 79.6 and 58.7, respectively, in a 44–13 victory over the Colts (in their last season in the AFC East) and a 30–10 loss to the Miami Dolphins.[122][123][124]  In the Patriots' fifth game, Brady began to find his stride. Trailing the visiting San Diego Chargers 26–16 in the fourth quarter, he led the Patriots on two scoring drives to force overtime, and another in overtime to set up a winning field goal. Brady finished the game with 33 of 54, for 364 yards, and two touchdowns, and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the first time in his career.[125][126] The following week, Brady again played well during the rematch at Indianapolis, with a passer rating of 148.3 in a 38–17 win.[127] The Patriots went on to win eleven of the fourteen games Brady started, and six straight to finish the regular season, winning the AFC East and entering the 2001–02 NFL playoffs with a first-round bye.[128] In that stretch was a Week 11 34–17 victory over the New Orleans Saints where he was 19 of 26 for 258 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week nod in 2001.[129] In Week 15, against the Miami Dolphins, he recorded a 23-yard reception from Kevin Faulk on a trick play.[130] Brady finished the 2001 season with 2,843 passing yards and 18 touchdowns and earned an invitation to the 2002 Pro Bowl.[118][131]  2001 postseason  In Brady's first playoff game, he threw for 312 yards against the Oakland Raiders and led the Patriots back from a ten-point fourth-quarter deficit to send the game to overtime, where they won on an Adam Vinatieri field goal. A controversial play occurred in the fourth quarter of that game. Trailing by three points, Brady lost control of the ball after being hit by Raiders cornerback and former Michigan teammate Charles Woodson. Oakland initially recovered the ball, but, citing the ""tuck rule,"" which states that any forward throwing motion by a quarterback begins a pass even if the quarterback loses possession of the ball as he is attempting to tuck it back toward his body, referee Walt Coleman overturned the call on instant replay, ruling it an incomplete pass rather than a fumble.[132] Brady finished the game 32-of-52 for 312 passing yards and one interception.[133]  In the AFC Championship Game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Brady injured his knee, and was relieved by Bledsoe.[134] The Patriots won the game by a score of 24–17 and were immediately installed by Las Vegas oddsmakers as 14-point underdogs against the NFC champion St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI.[135][136]  Brady returned from his knee injury in the AFC Championship Game to start in the Super Bowl a week later at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. Despite being heavy underdogs, the Patriots played well, holding the Rams' high powered offense in check through the first three quarters. The Rams rallied from a 17–3 deficit to tie the game with 1:30 left in regulation. The Patriots then got the ball back at their own 17-yard line with no timeouts remaining. Sportscaster and former Super Bowl-winning coach John Madden said he thought the Patriots should run out the clock and try to win the game in overtime.[137] Instead, Brady drove the Patriots' offense down the field to the Rams' 31-yard line before spiking the ball with seven seconds left. Kicker Adam Vinatieri converted a 48-yard field goal as time expired to give the Patriots a 20–17 win and their first ever league championship.[138] Brady was named MVP of Super Bowl XXXVI while throwing for 145 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions. At the age of 24 years and six months, Brady surpassed Joe Namath in Super Bowl III and Joe Montana in Super Bowl XVI, who were both 25 years, seven months, and 13 days old at the time of their victories, to earn the title of youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl.[139][140] A possible quarterback controversy was averted when Bledsoe was traded to the Buffalo Bills during the off-season; this event cemented Brady's status as the starting quarterback.[141]  2002 season  In the 2002 season opener, Brady had 294 passing yards and three touchdowns in the 30–14 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers to earn his third AFC Offensive Player of the Week title.[142][143] In Week 9, in a 38–7 victory over the Buffalo Bills, he had 265 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn another AFC Offensive Player of the Week nod.[144][145] Brady and the Patriots finished the year at 9–7, tied with the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins for the best record in the division; however, the Jets won the division on the third tiebreaker, and the Patriots missed the playoffs.[146] Though Brady posted a career-low single-season passer rating of 85.7 and a career-high of 14 interceptions, he threw for a league-leading 28 touchdown passes and 921 more yards than in the 2001 season.[122]  2003 season  After opening the 2003 NFL season with a 2–2 start, Brady led the Patriots to twelve consecutive victories to finish the regular season in winning the AFC East.[147] In Week 9, against the Denver Broncos, he had 350 passing yards, three touchdowns, and one interception in the 30–26 victory to earn his fifth AFC Offensive Player of the Week honor.[148][149] In Week 14, a 12–0 victory against the Miami Dolphins, he recorded a 36-yard punt in the game.[150] Statistically, Brady's strongest game of the season was in Week 17 against the division rival Buffalo Bills, when he achieved a season-high quarterback rating of 122.9, and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[122][151] Brady finished with 3,620 passing yards and 23 touchdowns,[118] and was third in NFL MVP voting to co-winners Peyton Manning and Steve McNair.[152]  2003 postseason  In the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Patriots defeated the Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round by a score of 17–14. In the win, Brady was 21 of 41 for 201 passing yards and one passing touchdown.[153] In the following round, they defeated Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship by a score of 24–14. Brady completed 22 of 37 passes for 237 yards, one passing touchdown, and an interception.[154] On February 1, 2004, Brady led the Patriots to a 32–29 victory over the NFC champion Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl XXXVIII and was named Super Bowl MVP for the second time. During the game, Brady threw for 354 yards with three touchdowns and set the record for most completions by a quarterback in a Super Bowl with 32. With 1:08 left in the fourth quarter and the score tied 29–29, Brady engineered a drive with five pass completions to put the Patriots in position for the game-winning 41-yard field goal by Vinatieri.[155][156]  2004 season  During the 2004 season, Brady helped the Patriots set an NFL record with 21 straight wins dating from the previous year, an accomplishment honored in the Pro Football Hall of Fame (though for official records, the NFL considers it an 18-game regular season winning streak; it does not count playoff games).[157] New England finished with a 14–2 record, equaling their 2003 record and the best regular-season record ever for a defending champion.[158] The Patriots also won the AFC East divisional title for the third time in four years.[159] Brady threw for 3,692 yards and 28 touchdowns, with a 92.6 passer rating, and was voted to his second Pro Bowl.[118]  2004 postseason  In the playoffs, Brady led the Patriots to victories over the Indianapolis Colts in the Divisional Round by a score of 20–3 and the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship by a score of 41–27.[160] Brady played his best game of the year in Pittsburgh despite requiring intravenous treatment the previous night when he ran a temperature of 103°.[161] Against the NFL's best defense,[160] he recorded a quarterback passer rating of 130.5, his highest of the season.[122] On February 6, 2005, the Patriots narrowly defeated the Philadelphia Eagles, 24–21, to win Super Bowl XXXIX at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida. Brady threw for 236 yards and two touchdowns[162] while capturing the Patriots' third championship in four years. They became the first franchise since the Dallas Cowboys in 1992–1995 to win three Super Bowls in four years.[163]  2005 season  During the 2005 season, injuries suffered by running backs Corey Dillon, Patrick Pass, and Kevin Faulk forced the Patriots to rely more on Brady's passing.[164][165] Brady also had to adjust to new center Russ Hochstein and running back Heath Evans. On October 9, in a 31–28 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, he had 350 passing yards, three touchdowns, and one interception to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors.[166][167] Brady finished first in the league with 4,110 passing yards and third in the league with 26 touchdowns.[118] At 92.3, his 2005 passer rating was the second-highest of his career at the time, although he equaled his career high for interceptions with 14.[122] He rushed for 89 yards and fumbled a career-low four times.[122] He and the Patriots finished with a 10–6 record, winning their third straight AFC East title.[168] He was named to his third Pro Bowl at the end of the season.[169]  2005 postseason  In the playoffs, Brady recorded 201 passing yards and three passing touchdowns to help lead the Patriots to a 28–3 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Wild Card Round. On January 14, 2006, the Patriots lost 27–13 to the Denver Broncos at INVESCO Field in the Divisional Round.[170][171] Brady threw for 341 yards in the game with one touchdown and two interceptions, in the first playoff loss of his career after ten playoff victories.[172] After the season's end, it was revealed that Brady had been playing with a sports hernia since December. Linebacker Willie McGinest commented on it and said he knew, but Brady continued playing.[173]  2006 season  Brady started the 2006 season with 163 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, and an interception against the Buffalo Bills in a 19–17 victory.[174] In Week 8, against the Minnesota Vikings, he had one of his stronger performances of the season with 372 passing yards, four passing touchdowns, and one interception in the 31–7 victory.[175] He posted another game with four passing touchdowns in the Week 11 35–0 victory over the Green Bay Packers.[176] Brady led the Patriots to a 12–4 record and the fourth seed in the AFC playoffs.[177] In the regular season, Brady threw for 3,529 yards and 24 touchdowns.[118] He was not among the players initially selected to the Pro Bowl,[178] although he was offered an injury-replacement selection when San Diego Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers was forced to withdraw. Brady ended up declining the invitation.[179]  2006 postseason  In the postseason, the Patriots first hosted their division rivals, the New York Jets, in the Wild Card Round. The Patriots defeated the Jets 37–16, as Brady went 22–34 for 212 yards and two touchdowns.[180] The Patriots traveled to San Diego to take on the Chargers in the Divisional Round. This was Brady's first playoff game in his home state of California. Brady and the Patriots struggled against the Chargers, whom many had picked as favorites to win Super Bowl XLI.[181] With eight minutes left in the fourth quarter and the Patriots down by eight points, Brady and the Patriots started a key drive that would ultimately decide the game. After a 49-yard pass play to wide receiver Reche Caldwell, a Stephen Gostkowski field goal gave the Patriots a 24–21 lead with 1:10 remaining. The Chargers drove down and attempted to tie the game with a 54-yard field goal attempt from Nate Kaeding, but it went no good and the Patriots won.[182]  In the AFC Championship, the Patriots faced the Indianapolis Colts. The Patriots and Colts had faced each other twice in the previous three postseasons at Foxborough; this game, however, was played at Indianapolis. The Patriots led at halftime, 21–6; however, the Colts and Peyton Manning staged a comeback, culminating in a last minute interception thrown by Brady, and the Patriots lost the game to the Colts, 34–38.[183] Brady finished the loss 21 of 34 for 232 yards, one touchdown, and one interception.[184]  2007 season  Playing with a dramatically overhauled receiver corps—in the 2007 off-season, the Patriots acquired wide receivers Donté Stallworth, Wes Welker, Kelley Washington, and Randy Moss; tight end Kyle Brady; and running back Sammy Morris—Brady enjoyed what some sportswriters described as one of the best seasons by a quarterback.[185][186] The average score of a 2007 Patriots regular-season game would be 37–17 by the end of the year.[187] Brady led the Patriots to the first 16–0 regular-season record in league history, outscoring opponents by more than a 2-to-1 margin, but also attained numerous career, franchise, and NFL records and milestones in the process. He was named as the AFC Offensive Player of the Week five separate times that year.[188][189][190][191][192] While away at Dallas, he had a career-high five passing touchdowns in a 48–27 win. The win tied him with Cowboys Hall of Fame quarterback Roger Staubach for the most wins ever by a starting quarterback in his first 100 regular-season games, with 76.[193] The next week, in part of a 49–28 win at Miami, he had yet another record day, with a career-high six passing touchdowns, setting a franchise record. He also had the first game with a perfect passer rating of his career.[194] Two weeks later, as part of a come-from-behind 24–20 victory at Indianapolis, he threw for another three touchdowns, the ninth consecutive game in which he had done so, breaking Peyton Manning's NFL record of eight.[195] During the last game of the year against the New York Giants, Brady threw two touchdown passes; his second touchdown was his 50th, breaking Peyton Manning's record of 49 in the 2004 season.[196]  Brady in Baltimore in December 2007  Brady finished the season with 4,806 passing yards, 50 touchdown passes, and only eight interceptions. It was unanimously voted the greatest passing season of all time by ESPN in 2013. His 50:8 touchdown to interception ratio was, at the time, an NFL record. He became the first quarterback to pass for 50 touchdowns in a season and his 117.2 passer rating is[when?] the fourth highest in a single season. His 8.7% touchdown passing percentage is[when?] the third highest ever in a season. He led the Patriots to becoming the first team to ever go undefeated in the regular season since the 16 game schedule was enforced and directed an offense that scored a then NFL record 589 points and 75 total touchdowns. Those records stood until they were eclipsed by the 2013 Denver Broncos. The team's 50 total touchdown passes is the fourth most ever in a season. For his efforts, Brady was named the Most Valuable Player of this season, as well as Offensive Player of the Year. He was also honored by the Associated Press as their Male Athlete of the Year, the first time an NFL player has been so honored since Joe Montana won the award in 1990.[197] He was named as a First Team All-Pro and to his fourth career Pro Bowl as a result of his historic season.[198][199]  2007 postseason  In the Patriots' first playoff game, a Divisional Round game against Jacksonville, Brady began the game with an NFL postseason record 16 consecutive completed passes, and finished the game with 26 completions in 28 attempts, a completion rate of 92.9%. That mark is the highest single-game completion percentage (for passers with at least 20 attempts) in NFL history, regular season or postseason.[200] With the win, the Patriots matched the undefeated 1972 Miami Dolphins as the only team to win 17 consecutive games in one season.  Statistically, Brady did not fare as well in the AFC Championship Game against the San Diego Chargers, throwing for 209 yards, two touchdowns, three interceptions (including his first interception in the red zone since the playoff loss to Denver in the 2005 postseason). Nevertheless, the Patriots won their 18th game of the season, 21–12, to advance to the Super Bowl for the fourth time in seven seasons. Brady, with the 100th win of his career, also set an NFL record for the fewest games needed by a starting quarterback to do so: his 100–26 record is sixteen games better than Joe Montana's.[201] In Super Bowl XLII at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, Brady was pressured heavily and sacked five times. The Patriots did manage to take the lead with a Brady touchdown to Moss with less than three minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, but the Giants were able to drive and score a last-minute touchdown to upset the Patriots 17–14, taking away what would have been the first perfect season since the NFL expanded its regular season to 16 games.[202]  Brady in action against the Washington Redskins on August 28, 2009.  2008 season  Brady did not play in any games during the 2008 preseason or in the 2008 Pro Bowl due to two different foot injuries.[203][204] In the Patriots' 2008 season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs at Gillette Stadium, Brady's left knee was seriously injured midway through the first quarter on a hit by Chiefs safety Bernard Pollard; he left the game and did not return. The team later confirmed that Brady would require surgery, and it would prematurely end his 2008 season.[205] Brady tore both his anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament.[206] The injury ended Brady's streak of 111 consecutive starts (ninth in the list of most consecutive starts by an NFL quarterback, behind Brett Favre, Peyton Manning, Eli Manning, Philip Rivers, Matt Ryan, Matthew Stafford, Ron Jaworski, and Joe Flacco).[207] Dr. Neal ElAttrache performed the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction at the Los Angeles Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic October 6, using Brady's patellar tendon graft to replace the torn ligament, and also repaired his medial collateral ligament, through a separate incision in his left knee.[208] An infection in the wound resulted in further debridement surgery several times since the original procedure. Brady received IV antibiotics for this infection which, at the time, threatened to delay his rehab.[209][210] Despite Brady's absence, the Patriots managed to finish the 2008 season with an 11–5 record; however, due to tiebreakers, the Patriots not only failed to win the AFC East division title, but missed the playoffs altogether for the first time since the 2002 season.[211]  2009 season  Brady playing on October 11, 2009 against the Denver Broncos  In his first game in nearly a year, Brady threw for 378 yards and two touchdowns in the 2009 season opener against the Buffalo Bills. In the final three minutes of the game, the Patriots were down 24–13 before Brady and tight end Benjamin Watson connected on two straight touchdowns to lead the Patriots to a 25–24 win.[212] Brady was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the 13th time in his career for his performance.[213]  On October 18, 2009, in an early season snowstorm, Brady set an NFL record against the Tennessee Titans for most touchdowns in a single quarter, throwing five in the second quarter. Brady finished the game with six touchdowns, tying his career-high from the 2007 season, and 380 yards, completing 29-of-34 attempts, finishing with a nearly perfect passer rating of 152.8.[214][215] He earned his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week nod for his efforts against the Titans.[216] The Patriots' 59–0 victory over the Titans tied the record for the largest margin of victory since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger,[217] and set a record for largest halftime lead in NFL history, which was 45–0.[218]  Brady finished the 2009 regular season with 4,398 yards passing and 28 touchdowns for a 96.2 rating,[118] despite a broken right ring finger and three fractured ribs, all which were suffered over the course of the season.[219] He was selected as a reserve to the 2010 Pro Bowl and named the 2009 NFL Comeback Player of the Year.[220][221]  2009 postseason  Brady ended the 2009 season throwing for 154 passing yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions in a Wild Card Round loss to the Baltimore Ravens, 33–14, his first career home playoff loss, and the first playoff loss at home by a Patriots quarterback since Steve Grogan lost to the Houston Oilers in the 1978 Divisional Round.[222]  2010 season  On September 10, 2010, Brady signed a four-year, $72 million contract extension, making him the highest-paid player in the NFL. The extension included $48.5 million in guaranteed money.[223]  Brady became the quickest quarterback to achieve 100 regular season wins by helping his team defeat the Miami Dolphins 41–14 on October 4.[224] In a 31–28 win over the Indianapolis Colts on November 21, Brady tied Brett Favre's record of winning 25 consecutive regular-season home starts.[225] Brady's last regular-season defeat at home was a 17–14 loss to the New York Jets on November 12, 2006.[226] On November 25, in a 45–24 victory over the Detroit Lions, he had 341 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[227][228] In the game, he earned a perfect passer rating for the second time in his career.[229][230] The next week, in a 45–3 victory over the New York Jets, he had 326 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for the second consecutive week. The victory over the Jets set an NFL record by winning 26 consecutive regular-season home starts.[231][232][233]  Brady threw for 3,900 yards with 36 touchdowns and only four interceptions on the season.[118] He had a 111.0 passer rating; this gave him — at the time — two of the top five season ratings in NFL history and made him the first player to finish with a rating above 110 in two different seasons.[234] The 2010 Patriots also tied an NFL record for a team by throwing only five interceptions in an entire season; as in addition to another touchdown towards the team total, Brian Hoyer also threw the first interception of his career.[235]  Brady was selected as a starter to the 2011 Pro Bowl.[236] However, he pulled out of the game (and was replaced by his former backup Matt Cassel, who then played for the Kansas City Chiefs) after undergoing surgery for a stress fracture in his right foot dating back to 2008.[237] Brady was also the only unanimous selection for the AP All-Pro Team and was named the 2010 Associated Press NFL Offensive Player of the Year. By unanimous decision, he won the MVP award for the second time in his career.[238] On the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011 players' list, Brady was ranked as the best player in the NFL by his fellow players.[239]  2010 postseason  After earning the #1 seed and a bye week, the Patriots lost to the New York Jets in the Divisional Round by a score of 28–21. Brady finished the game 29-of-45 for 299 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception. His one interception ended his NFL record of consecutive pass attempts without an interception at 340.[240][241]  2011 season  Brady in 2011  In Week 1 of the 2011 NFL season, Brady threw for a career-high 517 yards, four touchdowns, and one interception in a 38–24 victory over the Miami Dolphins and earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors.[242] In the game, he threw a record-tying 99-yard touchdown pass to Wes Welker.[243][244][16] In the next game, a 35–21 victory over the San Diego Chargers, he had 423 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn another AFC Offensive Player of the Week nod.[245][246] In Week 16, against the Miami Dolphins, Brady had 304 passing yards and one passing touchdown to go along with nine rushes for 17 yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 27–24 victory to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the third time in 2011.[247][248] In the regular season finale against the Buffalo Bills, Brady became the fourth quarterback to throw for 5,000 yards in a single season, finishing with 5,235; although Brady surpassed Dan Marino's longstanding record of 5,084 passing yards, he finished the season second in passing yards behind Drew Brees' 5,476.[118] The Patriots finished the season 13–3 and clinched the AFC's #1 seed.[249] For his efforts in the 2011 season, Brady was named to the Pro Bowl and was named as the fourth best player in the NFL on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012 by his peers.[250][251]  2011 postseason  [252] There's no quarterback I'd rather have than Tom Brady. He's the best. He does so much for us in so many ways on so many different levels. I'm very fortunate that he's our quarterback and what he's able to do for this team. It's good to win with him and all the rest of our players. If that's more than somebody else did, I don't really care about that. —Bill Belichick  In the Patriots' 45–10 win over the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round, Brady set a personal postseason best with 363 passing yards, and tied an NFL playoff record shared by Daryle Lamonica and Steve Young, throwing for six touchdown passes.[253] The win, his first postseason win since the 2007 season, gave Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick sole possession of the NFL record for postseason wins by a quarterback-head coach duo with 15.[254] In the AFC Championship game against the Baltimore Ravens, Brady failed to throw a touchdown pass for the first time in 36 games, though he did pass for 239 yards and scored a one-yard rushing touchdown late in the game. A missed field goal from Ravens kicker Billy Cundiff gave Brady and the Patriots a 23–20 victory, sending Brady to his fifth Super Bowl.[255] In Super Bowl XLVI at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Brady and the Patriots met the New York Giants in a rematch of their Super Bowl XLII meeting four years earlier. On the Patriots' first offensive series, Brady was penalized for intentional grounding in the end zone, giving up a safety which gave the Giants an early 2–0 lead. Brady would bounce back from this early blunder, leading a Super Bowl record-tying 96-yard touchdown drive to close the first half and at one point completing 16 consecutive passes to give him a 20-of-23 mark partway into the third quarter, another Super Bowl record.[256] However, as was also the case four years earlier, the Patriots could not hold a late lead and allowed Eli Manning to lead the Giants to a game-winning touchdown with less than a minute left, giving Brady his second career Super Bowl loss.[257]  2012 season  Brady started all 16 regular season games of the 2012 NFL season and led the Patriots to a 12–4 record. Among the many highlights of the team was a 42–14 win over the Houston Texans in Week 14. Brady had 296 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[258][259] The Patriots scored 557 total points, the third highest in league history and Brady became the first quarterback to lead his team to ten division titles.[260] With that point total, the Patriots became the first team to score at least 500 points in a season four different times, with Brady leading all four squads, which was a record as well. He finished the season with 4,827 passing yards, 34 touchdowns, only eight interceptions, and a passer rating of 98.7. It was Brady's third straight season throwing for over 30 touchdowns.[261] He was named to the Pro Bowl for the eighth time in his career.[262] On the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013, Brady was ranked fourth by his fellow players for the second consecutive year.[263]  2012 postseason  Brady started both Patriots playoff games, winning 41–28 over the Houston Texans in the Divisional Round.[264] Brady passed for 344 yards and three touchdowns as he led the team to the AFC Championship Game. With the victory, Brady surpassed Joe Montana for most career playoff wins, with 17.[265] The Patriots were then upset by the eventual Super Bowl XLVII champion Baltimore Ravens, 28–13 in the AFC Championship. He threw for 320 yards and one touchdown with two interceptions.[266] He suffered his first career loss at home when leading by halftime, in which he was previously 67–0.[267]  On February 25, 2013, Brady and the Patriots agreed on a three-year contract extension, which kept him with the team through 2017.[268] Sportswriter Peter King called it an ""amazing"" deal, as Brady took just $27 million in new money over the 2015, 2016, and 2017 seasons, and also noted that it reflected Patriots owner Robert Kraft's desire to make sure that Brady retired as a Patriot.[269]  2013 season  Brady and the Patriots began the season with much upheaval on the offensive side of the ball. Tight end Rob Gronkowski was injured and Aaron Hernandez was arrested. Wes Welker departed to the Denver Broncos, Danny Woodhead left in free agency for the San Diego Chargers, and Brandon Lloyd was released from the team. In order to replace the five players, the Patriots signed Danny Amendola in free agency from the Rams, drafted rookie wide receivers Aaron Dobson and Josh Boyce, and signed undrafted rookie free agent wide receiver Kenbrell Thompkins. In the first two games of the season, Brady completed 52% of his passes and had three touchdowns and one interception.[270][271]  Brady during the 2013 season  Brady was in pursuit of Drew Brees's record of at least one touchdown in 54 consecutive regular season games and saw the streak end at 52 games in a Week 5 loss against the Cincinnati Bengals.[272] In a Week 6 game against the Saints, the Patriots struggled in the first half and bounced back in the second with Brady passing for 269 yards with a touchdown to Kenbrell Thompkins as time expired to pull out the win over the Saints.[273]  In Week 12, Brady faced-off against Peyton Manning for the fourteenth time in his career.

On May 11, Brady was suspended for four games by the NFL for his involvement based on ""substantial and credible evidence"" that Brady knew Patriots employees were deflating footballs and that he failed to cooperate with the investigators.[302] On May 11, Troy Vincent—NFL Executive Vice President of Football Operations—penned a letter to Brady that stated in part: ""Your actions as set forth in the report clearly constitute conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in the game of professional football."" Vincent's letter further stated: ""With respect to your particular involvement, the report established that there is substantial and credible evidence to conclude you were at least generally aware of the actions of the Patriots' employees involved in the deflation of the footballs and that it was unlikely that their actions were done without your knowledge. Moreover, the report documents your failure to cooperate fully and candidly with the investigation, including by refusing to produce any relevant electronic evidence (emails, texts, etc.), despite being offered extraordinary safeguards by the investigators to protect unrelated personal information, and by providing testimony that the report concludes was not plausible and contradicted by other evidence."" Brady, through the NFL Players Association, appealed the suspension on May 14.[304]  On July 28, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell upheld Brady's four-game suspension.[305] Brady gave permission to the NFLPA to appeal the suspension in federal court.[306] Goodell cited Brady's destruction of his cell phone as a critical factor in his decision to uphold Brady's suspension.[307][308] The NFL also filed papers in federal court seeking to confirm Roger Goodell's decision.[309] On July 29 Brady released a statement on his Facebook page that criticized Goodell's decision to uphold the suspension, saying in part ""I am very disappointed by the NFL's decision to uphold the 4 game suspension against me. I did nothing wrong, and no one in the Patriots organization did either... I will not allow my unfair discipline to become a precedent for other NFL players without a fight.""[310][311]  Brady in November 2015  Commentary on the initial punishment was mixed. Bleacher Report writer Mike Freeman made a statement agreeing with Goodell's decision, saying the penalties were ""brutal, but it deserved to be.""[312] Various commentators also implied that the prior reputation of the Patriots organization as a team that bends rules appeared to factor into the harshness of the punishment.[312][313] Others described the punishment as ""firm but fair"".[314]  On September 3, Judge Richard M. Berman of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated Brady's suspension; this ruling allowed Brady to play in the first four games of the 2015 NFL season. In his decision, Judge Berman cited the NFL's failure to provide proper notice to Brady of the charges against him and the potential for a suspension.[315] Post-appeal commentary also criticized Goodell for ""manipulating Brady's testimony"" at the appeal hearing in his decision.[316]  2015 season  In the NFL Kickoff Game, Brady led the Patriots to a 28–21 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. He threw for 288 yards and four touchdowns, three of them to Rob Gronkowski.[317] The Patriots' victory was the 161st victory of Brady's career, all with the Patriots, which surpassed the record held by former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre for most regular season wins by a starting quarterback with a single team.[318] In Week 2, Brady threw for 466 yards and three touchdowns against the Buffalo Bills.

The Broncos' top-ranked defense limited Brady, who completed 27-of-56 passes with two interceptions and a passing touchdown, all day, and the Patriots eventually lost the game 20–18 after a potential game-tying two-point conversion attempt failed with less than half a minute remaining.[331]  2016 off-season  On February 29, 2016, Brady signed a two-year contract extension covering the 2018 and 2019 seasons.[332] On March 3, the NFL appealed Judge Richard M. Berman's 2015 decision to vacate Brady's four-game suspension as punishment for his alleged role in the Deflategate scandal. At the hearing, the three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit questioned Players Association lawyer Jeffrey L. Kessler and NFL lawyer Paul Clement, with Circuit Judge Denny Chin stating that ""the evidence of ball tampering is compelling, if not overwhelming.""[333]  On April 25, the decision to vacate Brady's four-game suspension was overturned by the U.S. Appeals Court.[334][335] Circuit Judge Barrington Daniels Parker Jr., joined by Circuit Judge Chin, wrote that they could not ""second-guess"" the arbitration but were merely determining it ""met the minimum legal standards established by the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947"".[336] Circuit Chief Judge Robert Katzmann dissented, writing that the NFL's fines for using stickum was ""highly analogous"" and that here ""the Commissioner was doling out his own brand of industrial justice.""[337] On May 23, Brady appealed for his case to be reheard by the full U.S. 2nd Circuit Court.[338] The 2nd Circuit Court denied Brady's request for an en banc hearing on July 13.[339] On July 15, Brady announced on that he would give up his Deflategate fight and accept his suspension for the first four regular season games of the 2016 season.[340]  2016 season  Brady during the 2016 season  After serving his four-game suspension, Brady made his 2016 season debut on October 9 on the road against the Cleveland Browns; he completed 28-of-40 passes for 406 yards and three touchdowns in a 33–13 victory to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[341][342] In his home debut the following week, Brady completed 29-of-35 passes for 376 yards and three touchdowns in a 35–17 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals.[343] In Week 7, Brady completed 19 of 26 passes for 222 yards and two touchdowns as New England defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27–16.[344] The next week, the Patriots defeated the Buffalo Bills 41–25, with Brady completing 22-of-33 passes for 315 yards and four touchdowns.[345] Brady's outstanding numbers during his first four games following the suspension earned him the AFC Offensive Player of the Month award for October.[346]  Following a bye week, Brady and the Patriots faced the Seattle Seahawks in a Week 10 rematch of Super Bowl XLIX.

This was the first time in nine Super Bowl appearances in which Brady did not have a passing touchdown, though with the game tied 3–3 and less than eight minutes left he successfully connected with Rob Gronkowski down the sideline between three defenders to set up what would be the decisive touchdown.[423] With the victory, the Patriots became the second NFL team to win six Super Bowls, tying the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most in NFL history.[424] In addition, Brady became the first player ever to win six Super Bowls, breaking a tie with Charles Haley, as well as the oldest quarterback at 41 years of age to win a Super Bowl.[425][426]  2019 season: Final season in New England  On August 4, 2019, one day after his 42nd birthday, Brady signed a two-year contract extension worth $70 million that covered both the 2020 and the 2021 seasons;[427] the terms of the contract allowed Brady to become a free agent after the 2019 season.[428] Against the 2019 Patriots salary cap Brady was the highest-paid player on the team at $21.5 million.[429]  Brady began his 20th NFL season by completing 24 of 36 passes for 341 yards and three touchdowns in a 33–3 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers.[430] The next week, in a 43–0 win over the Miami Dolphins, Brady completed 20 out of 28 passes for 264 yards and two touchdowns; in addition, he also scored a rushing touchdown. During a 33–7 victory against the Washington Redskins in Week 5, Brady surpassed Brett Favre for third place on the all-time passing yards list and finished only 17 yards short of tying his former rival Peyton Manning for second place.[431] On the first drive of the following week against the New York Giants, Brady surpassed Manning to take over second place on the all-time passing yards list, behind only New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees.[432] However, Brady struggled during the second half of the season, and the Patriots lost three out of their next five games following an 8–0 start, including back-to-back losses in Weeks 13 and 14 against the Houston Texans and Kansas City Chiefs. Brady's career passer rating dropped from fourth to sixth highest among qualified QBs in NFL history.[433] In Week 15, against the Cincinnati Bengals, Brady moved to within one touchdown of tying Peyton Manning on the all-time passing touchdowns list with 538.[434] In the Patriots’ 34–13 victory, which guaranteed the team a spot in the playoffs for an 11th straight season, Brady had 128 passing yards and two touchdowns.[435] Brady played in his final regular season game with the Patriots two weeks later, in Week 17 at home against the Miami Dolphins. Brady threw for 221 yards and two touchdowns, but also threw an interception that was returned by former Patriots teammate Eric Rowe for a touchdown. The game ended with the Dolphins defeating the Patriots 27–24; this result, combined with a win by the Chiefs, denied New England a first round bye for the first time in 10 years. The first of Brady's two touchdowns against Miami in Week 17 was the 540th of his career, moving him ahead of Peyton Manning for the second most touchdown passes in NFL history.[436]  For the first time since the 2008 season, the year when he tore his ACL, Brady was not selected to the Pro Bowl.[437] That season as the Patriots' defense that was winning games while the offense was stagnant, Brady told friends that he ""felt Belichick had taken the offense for granted because of how good it had been for so long"" and said to NBC that he was the ""most miserable 8–0 quarterback in the NFL.""[423] However, Sporting News would name him their ""NFL Athlete of the Decade"".[438]  2019 postseason  Despite finishing the regular season with a 12–4 record and winning the AFC East title for the 11th consecutive year, the Patriots were forced to start their postseason run in the Wild Card Round for the first time since 2009, where they faced the Tennessee Titans. With his team trailing by a 14–13 score and pinned back on their own 1-yard line with 15 seconds left in the game, Brady's 37th and final pass attempt of the game – and his last pass attempt as a New England Patriot – was intercepted and returned for a touchdown by former teammate and Titans cornerback Logan Ryan, which effectively sealed the 20–13 win for Tennessee.[439] This marked the first time since the 2010 season that the Patriots went one-and-done in the playoffs;[440] The loss ended the Patriots' chance of advancing to their fourth consecutive Super Bowl appearance, which would have matched a feat that only their division rival, the Buffalo Bills (1990–1993), had accomplished. In addition, this also marked the first time since the 2010 season in which the Patriots did not reach the AFC Championship Game, ending their NFL record run of eight consecutive AFC title game appearances. The loss to the Titans was Brady's final game as a New England Patriot; on March 17, 2020, the day before his contract with the Patriots expired, Brady announced that he would not re-sign with the team for the 2020 season, ending his 20-year tenure in New England.[441]  After Brady signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, billboards thanking Brady for his 20 years were posted alongside the Massachusetts Turnpike, a mile from Gillette Stadium and ten other locations around New England.[442]  Tampa Bay Buccaneers  Brady signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on March 20, 2020. The two-year contract was worth $50 million in fully guaranteed money, with up to $4.5 million each year in incentives. The deal also included a no-trade and a no-tag clause.[443] Although his career number of 12 was already taken, Chris Godwin agreed to give it to Brady and switched to number 14.[444]  In April 2020, Brady was reunited with his former Patriots teammate Rob Gronkowski when the tight end came out of retirement, and was traded to the Buccaneers.[445] Head coach Bruce Arians stated that it was Brady himself who was adamant for the team to trade for Gronkowski.[446]  NFL career statistics  Regular season  Tom Brady regular season statistics Year Team Games Passing Rushing Sacked Fumbles Record G

within a week of that year's Super Bowl.[479][480] In 2009, he appeared as himself in a sixth season episode of Entourage.[481] In 2015, he had cameo appearances as fictionalized versions of himself in the Entourage movie[482] and Ted 2.[483]  In 2007, Brady was a model for the Stetson cologne.[484] Brady has endorsed brands including Uggs, Under Armour, Movado, Aston Martin and Glaceau Smartwater. According to Forbes, he earned about $7 million from endorsements alone in 2014.[485][486][487] In 2016, he began appearing in a Beautyrest Black commercial campaign for Simmons Bedding Company.[488] In 2016, he launched his own line of vegan snacks.[489]  On January 20, 2016, Brady announced the launch of his peak performance website TB12Sports.com. The site features information on Brady's training regimen and includes a store to purchase TB12 equipment and merchandise.[490] Later in the year, on August 23, 2016, the TB12 brand then expanded to offer a snack line. The snacks contain raw, vegan, and organic ingredients that are also free of gluten and dairy.[491] The following month, Brady, alongside Boston Private and Robert Paul Properties, announced the formation of the TB12 Foundation. The purpose of the nonprofit foundation is to provide free post-injury rehabilitation care and training to underprivileged, young athletes.[492] In March 2017, Brady moved beyond his snack line and partnered with meal-kit startup Purple Carrot to offer his own line of TB12 Performance Meals. The meals utilize whole foods and focus on providing nutrients for workout recovery.[493][494] On September 19, 2017, Simon & Schuster published Brady's first book, The TB12 Method: How to Achieve a Lifetime of Sustained Peak Performance. Within 48 hours, it had become a number one best-seller on Amazon.com.[495] The book also reached #1 on The New York Times' weekly Best Sellers list, to be featured in the edition of October 8, 2017.[496]  Filmmaker Gotham Chopra filmed Brady during the 2017 off-season and regular season for a Facebook Watch documentary series entitled Tom vs Time. According to The New York Times, the documentary follows Brady as he ""conducts his ongoing subversion campaign against the actuarial tables of quarterback longevity.""[497]  Personal life  Brady dated actress Bridget Moynahan from 2004 until late 2006.[498] On February 18, 2007, Moynahan confirmed to People magazine that she was more than three months pregnant with Brady's child.[498][499] Brady and Moynahan ended their relationship sometime in early December 2006, around the time Moynahan became pregnant.[500] John Edward Thomas Moynahan[501] was born in August 2007 at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California.[502]  Brady began dating Brazilian model Gisele Bündchen in December 2006.[503] In 2009, Brady said they had been set up on a blind date by a mutual friend.[504] Brady and Bündchen married on February 26, 2009, in an intimate Catholic ceremony in Santa Monica, California.[505] Together, they have two children: a son named Benjamin Rein born in December 2009,[506] and a daughter named Vivian Lake born in December 2012.[507]  Brady and baseball player Kevin Youkilis became brothers-in-law in 2012, when Youkilis married Brady's sister Julie.[508] He and his family reside in Brookline, Massachusetts, as well as New York City.[509] They own several homes together and spend time during the summer at the Yellowstone Club near Big Sky, Montana, as well as their home at Silo Ridge in Amenia, New York.[510][511] When Brady signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he rented a mansion in Tampa, Florida, owned by retired baseball player and Miami Marlins owner Derek Jeter.[512]  Politics  Brady attended the 2004 State of the Union Address as a special guest of then-President George W. Bush.[513] In 2004, he told ESPN The Magazine that being a U.S. Senator would be his ""craziest ambition"".[514][515]  Brady is a friend of President Donald Trump;[516][517] in 2017, Brady indicated he had known Trump ""for 16 years"".[518] At a political event in New Hampshire on the day before the 2016 presidential election, Trump said he had received a call from Brady, and that Brady told him ""Donald, I support you, you're my friend, and I voted for you."" However, after his wife was asked directly on Instagram whether she and Brady backed Trump, Bündchen answered ""NO!""[519] After a Trump campaign ""Make America Great Again"" cap was photographed in Brady's locker, Brady said that Bündchen told him not to discuss politics anymore, which he thought was a ""good decision"".[520] Brady did not join the New England Patriots in visiting Trump and the White House in April 2017 after their Super Bowl victory, citing ""personal family matters"".[521]  In an interview with Howard Stern on The Howard Stern Show in April 2020, Brady talked about how Donald Trump had reached out to him to speak at the 2016 Republican National Convention and that he had politely declined, telling Stern: "" It was uncomfortable for me because you can't undo things, not that I would",real

3580,"""I have always had Caitlyn's back, but she is not a good person,"" Kim says on the season premiere of KUWTK  Kim Kardashian Slams 'Liar' Caitlyn Jenner for Comments About Late Father Robert: 'She Is Not a Good Person'  In a sneak peek at Sunday’s season 14 premiere, Kim and Kourtney Kardashian travel to Cleveland to visit Khloé Kardashian, who spends much of time there with her boyfriend, Cavaliers player Tristan Thompson — but they’re interrupted by a news alert about Caitlyn’s then-unreleased memoir, The Secrets of My Life.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “It says in Caitlyn’s book Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty, but joined the defense team to get back at his re-married ex,” reads Kim, 36. “Robert told Caitlyn in secret after the O.J. murder trial that he believed his friend was guilty.”  “That’s not true!” interrupts Khloé, 33. “Like, what?”  “Like, to sell a book, you’re gonna make something up?” says Kourtney, 37.  “Dad so believed in him,” Kim says. “It is so shady that Caitlyn came over and gave me the book, and then on the phone she said, ‘Well, the final version has a few more things in it, but don’t worry, it’s nothing about you.’ So she lied to me, because that is about me, if it’s about our dad.”  “I have always had Caitlyn’s back,” she tells her sisters. “But she is a liar. She is not a good person.”  “My relationship with Caitlyn was strained,” Kim later admits in a confessional. “I was just trying to be respectful. But if you talk about my dad, I will cut you.”  RELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian Threatens Caitlyn Jenner Over Her New Memoir — ‘Talk Bad About My Mom, I Come for You’  In her memoir, which was released April 25, Caitlyn claimed the late Robert Kardashian Sr. once implied he thought his friend O.J. Simpson was guilty of having killed wife Nicole Brown Simpson and waiter Ron Goldman — despite having served as the NFL star’s defense attorney in his 1994 murder trial.  Caitlyn, 67, wrote that she was in the car with Robert in the late ’90s — following Simpson’s initial acquittal and later conviction of manslaughter in a civil trial — when he allegedly said, “I would’ve been okay with it if they had gotten him in the first trial.”  “The implication was obvious that [Robert] believed O.J. was guilty,” she added.  Caitlyn went on to speculate whether part of Robert’s motivation behind defending Simpson was to obtain some form of revenge against his ex-wife Kris Jenner, who was close friends with Brown Simpson.  “I wonder if it was his way of saying to [Kris] what I think she was saying to him when she married me: a big f— you,” she wrote.",fake
14539,"In his follow-up to The People v OJ Simpson, Ryan Murphy spins the designer’s murder into a compelling story of deceit, ambition and what it meant to be gay at the turn of the century  The title of the new season of Ryan Murphy’s American Crime Story is tailor-made to drum up anticipation: “The Assassination of Gianni Versace”, it reads, invoking one of the most notorious murders of the 1990s.  Where the first installment of the anthology series – The People v OJ Simpson – was about exactly that, this time both the name and the promotional material amount to a shiny, sequined red herring. The assassination in question takes place in the very first scene of the series and, unlike the crimes of which Simpson was accused, there’s no ensuing legal battle that grips the country, collectively watching a White Bronco on the 405. So Murphy, television’s pre-eminent dramatist, quite literally flips the script. Versace doesn’t reach the heights of season one, and it’s slow to boil, but at it’s best it makes for thrilling, macabre, deliciously campy television.  Glitz, glamour and tragedy: how Gianni Versace rewrote the rules of fashion Read more  If The People v OJ took the gruesome murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman and wove them into a fraught tale of racial politics, Versace uses its eponymous victim to tell a story about being gay in America: the seclusion and loneliness of the closet, the pain of stymied desire, the necessary accumulation of lies, and the confusion of a post-Aids-crisis, pre-Will-and-Grace world in which tolerance is nascent but skepticism still pervasive.  At the center of all this is Andrew Cunanan, who in 1997 went on a cross-country murder spree, killing Jeffrey Trail, David Madson, Lee Miglin, William Reese and, finally, Gianni Versace, on the front steps of his Miami Beach mansion. Murphy, with Tom Rob Smith adapting Maureen Orth’s book Vulgar Favors, chooses to tell the story in reverse, a gambit that can be confusing but begins to pay off several episodes in. The desired effect is to watch criminality unfurl itself backwards, to show the origin story of a killer as perversely apathetic and strangely endearing as Cunanan. But the tactic is neither necessary nor particularly enhancing.  Cunanan is played by Darren Criss, the velvet-voiced Warbler of Glee fame. His portrayal is not convincing at first, but like everything in the series, it improves with time and exposure. As the closeted, bespectacled killer, Criss is clearly inspired by Anthony Perkins’ Norman Bates and Malcolm McDowell’s Alex DeLarge; charm is conveyed through widened eyes, sweetness through an uptick in cadence, and homosexuality through a cock of the wrist or a wiggle of the hips, which is maybe why we should cast gay actors to play gay characters a little more often. But despite the capital-A acting, Criss is nothing if not dedicated, and he comes to embody Cunanan quite formidably by the time he’s gallivanting through gay bars telling people he’s a set designer on the upcoming movie Titanic.

The next installment of Ryan Murphy's award-winning series premieres 1/17 on FX. #ACSVersace pic.twitter.com/ktM44SNzLw  What really makes this series excel is an inarguably stellar supporting cast. It’s impossible to turn away from Penélope Cruz as Donatella Versace, wearing a black-laced veil as she confronts her brother’s corpse; Edgar Ramírez as Gianni is commanding and quietly tortured; Max Greenfield is superb as a South Beach junkie who crosses paths with Cunanan and makes it out alive; Finn Wittrock, playing a closeted naval officer after the signing of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, is the first of Cunanan’s victims; and Judith Light, in a single-episode cameo as the widow of the Chicago real estate developer Lee Miglin, is, well, Judith Light (read: brilliant). Murphy’s heavy-handedness is not to everyone’s liking, but he always manages to squeeze all the pulp out of his performers.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Penélope Cruz as Donatella Versace in a scene from The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story. Photograph: Jeff Daly/AP  In following Cunanan’s deadly joyride, the show also takes us from Miami to Minneapolis to Chicago to La Jolla. One moment, we’re at the Versace mansion, as chiseled butlers serve orange juice on silver trays, and the next we’re in seedy motels and lakeside cottages as characters snort heroin and hunt quail. The contrast says as much about class as it does the geographical scope of the murders; Cunanan is both killer and liar, but more than anything he’s a striver, with Versace advertisements thumb-tacked to his wall and an expensive wardrobe mostly gifted to him by the older, rich men whom he dates and, in some cases, slays.  The smartest thing about the show is that, in stark contrast to the courtroom procedural style of The People v OJ Simpson, each episode plays like a standalone film. Versace’s name may be in the title, but Miglin, Trail and Madson get almost as much backstory, not to mention Cunanan, the only character who appears in every episode. Which is to say that, in the world of the show, queer lives mean very little to law enforcement; in the world of Ryan Murphy, though, they’re each deserving of attention, regardless of wealth or fame.",real

The episode, filmed at least a month prior to her filing for divorce on Dec. 13, shows Odom calling Kardashian, begging for forgiveness regarding nasty comments his father Joe made to the media about her family.  ""Lamar called and was crying,"" Kardashian revealed. ""He was really sad and he kept apologizing about today. He was making me cry.""  In fact, Kardashian said Odom told her he would ""kill"" for her family and that he loves the Kardashians.

Take me through the mud, but please don't drag my family through it.""  In another apologetic call, Khloe's sister Kourtney Kardashian spoke to Odom about their relationship and said: ""We love you and we're here for you. I just want to do whatever I can.""  Odom went as far as to send Khloe's other sister Kim Kardashian his statement about his father's comments he was about to release, which he eventually tweeted Sept. 24.

After all this, Odom tried desperately to see his estranged wife.  ""I'll see you tonight,"" he said. ""I'll bring dinner tonight with champagne.""  It's also revealed he stopped by at 1 a.m. and that Khloe didn't want him at the house.  ""I miss you too but I can't see you,"" she told him. ""It's just so confusing.""

There’s no reason I would get one but I have been secretly hoping @KimKardashian would send me one of those chocolate hearts with perfume in it so I could bust it open with a tiny mallet,” she tweeted.

Listening to Malika try play voice of reason knowing her dating history for the past decade has exclusively been as a side piece, is blowing me!    Always knew Dorothy was a little insecure, unassuming & passive aggressive but she hid behind Morgan well on her show and played victim. She truly is unfriendly and cannot hide her deeply superficial judgement of people, that's why she has few friends and no dates - if people only approach/deal with her for her money then she has a part in that. Her fillers were not needed.    Callum should not be on this show, he fancies himself this big character as a reality star and he's just not. It's wearing me thin watching him center himself in every scene.    Karina's a tad neurotic. Like girl, he's shit...he's shown you he's a fuckboy. You've dated men like him before and it never worked, so openly meet new people. Geez, relax.    Chad is ugly and another one who overestimates his level of importance, appeal, & aesthetic. Ugh.    Tiffany's joking but she's going to the extreme with the sex talk that I'm thinking there's truth to some of it. She's deeply insecure and anxious, probably doesn't want to come across as undesirable to others.    I don't think they learn anything on this show, and they always seem pretty bored with the process unless they find someone in-house to hookup with. If you really wanted a cast that could date each other as tests, then have members who are compatible in more ways than not or suitable to teach them about themselves. The show just needs some amping up and better therapy sessions w more structured workshops for the cast.",real

4395,"There are probably quite a lot of things that Kristen Stewart would like to undo after pictures showed her cheating on Robert Pattinson with a married film director.  But unfortunately for Kristen, life doesn’t have the ctrl+z option so she’s stuck with any mistakes she (might) have made – and embarrassing things she might have said.  Just one month before she was exposed as a cheat with Rupert Sanders, she revealed that she wants to have babies with her long-term boyfriend R-Pattz.  In an un-guarded moment, she told Vogue journalist Christa D’Souza: ""My God, I'm so in love with my boyfriend. I wish he were here now. I think I want to have his babies.""  Before adding: “I love the way he smells. And him me. Like, he loves to lick under my armpits.”  While it’s ultimately quite a gross thing to say, it proves that Rob found Kristen so amazing he was happy to lick her sweaty pits. But he’s not the only person to think his Twilight co-star is, er, flawless.  Rupert describes Kristen, 22, as ""amazing"" and ""flawless"" in the voiceover on the Snow White and the Huntsman DVD director's commentary.  It’s a fair assumption this was filmed before his fling with K-Stew became world (and wife Liberty Ross) knowledge.  (Image: Getty)  Before the affair, Rupert was asked whether Kristen and Liberty – who also featured in the movie – were friends.  He replied: ""She and Liberty didn't have very many scenes together, so they didn't get to know each other that well. But they definitely have similarities. There's a look they share.""  Yesterday, Kristen wore Rob's t-shirt which had the word IRIE printed on the front when she arrived in Toronto for the film festival.  And if you didn't know what that means, it stands for ‘the way you feel when you have no worries – to be at total peace with your current state of being’.

While the past 14 years have just flown by, fans of the Disney series have never given up hope on getting another sequel. And if new reports are to be believed, The Princess Diaries 3 is finally on the way, but will Anne Hathaway and Chris Pine return? Here's what we know so far.  As of 2019, the film is still very much on.  While the bulk of updates about Princess Diaries 3 came out in 2017, Anne Hathaway was asked about the status of the project during her January 2019 appearance on Watch What Happens Live. She wants it to happen. Julie Andrews wants it to happen. They're working on it.  ""There is a script for the third movie.... There is a script,” she said. ""I want to do it. Julie [Andrews] wants to do it. Debra Martin Chase, our producer, wants to do it. We all really want it to happen.

Even before Hathaway confirmed there was a script, the author of The Princess Diaries book series, Meg Cabot told Entertainment Weekly that a script exists. She also said that if the movie gets made, it'll happen ""kind of as a tribute"" to Garry Marshall, director of the first two movies, who passed away in 2016. But Cabot refused to reveal any further details, apart from saying that the movies would likely deviate from the book series. She said, ""I think of them as two different universes.""  Garry Marshall was planning the third installment before he died.  In an interview with People in March 2016, Marshall said, ""I was with Anne Hathaway a couple weeks ago. It looks like we want to do The Princess Diaries 3 in Manhattan."" Sadly, Marshall's plan never came to fruition, but it's possible that the sequel will still be set in New York, to honor his idea.  Anne Hathaway has a secret idea for the sequel.  Julie Andrews, who plays Queen Clarisse Renaldi in the movies, told Buzzfeed in February 2017, ""Annie had an idea that she wanted to pursue about it, and I'm all for it, so if she'd like to…"" And, yes, the ""Annie"" she's referring to is Anne Hathaway. Andrews also confirmed, ""I would very willingly and happily do it.""  However, it might be some time before 'The Princess Diaries 3' eventuates.  Hathaway's rep reportedly told Buzzfeed in March 2017, ""It's way too premature to discuss this project.""  While appearing on Watch What Happens Live in October 2019, Andrews was asked about the status of a Princess Diaries 3 script, to which she replied, ""Well, the truth is I haven't heard. But there's been talk about it for quite a while,"" adding, ""I think [co-star Hathaway] had or is having a second child and she's busy and I've been busy.

13037,"Entrepreneur and former MTV reality star Whitney Port has established herself as a mom-guru since she and husband Tim Rosenman welcomed their first child, Sonny, back in July. From early morning feedings to mental breakdowns, and even the occasional celebratory first-time-mom moments, 32-year-old Port documents it all on her YouTube channel and blog. By developing a strong relationship with her followers who look to her for advice and even offer tips and tricks in return, she's taken the parenting world by storm.  A post shared by Bundle Organics (@bundleorganics) on Aug 22, 2017 at 5:37pm PDT  You may recognize Port from MTV's hit show The Hills, which first aired back in 2006. At the time, Port worked alongside Lauren Conrad at Teen Vogue, as the stylish, soft-spoken intern to join the Laguna Beach spinoff. She continued her stint on reality TV with The City—a continuation of The Hills that followed Port's life working for designer Diane Von Furstenberg in New York City. Since her time on MTV, Port has transformed from TV personality to fashion designer, creative director, and CEO of her fashion brand Whitney Eve.  Image zoom  Now, with the holidays just around the corner, Port has paired up with Tylenol to promote healthy living during cold and flu season. As she and Rosenman prepare Sonny for his first trip on an airplane, they are relying on Tylenol to manage their families well-being through all the chaos.  We caught up with Port to talk surviving the holidays, Sonny's first flight, and what she has in store for the new year.  She wants to be fully prepared for the holidays. ""I definitely feel the pressure. Let me put it this way: I don't feel so much pressure to make everything so perfect because Sonny at this point is only going to be 5-months-old. I feel a little bit of pressure that I need to have everything prepared and ready to go for the travel and for Sonny's schedule to be organized. We are going to be with family and I don't want to feel like I don't have it under control.""  She understands that she can't plan everything. ""I'm most nervous that Sonny is going to be uncomfortable on the plane and I'm not going to know why—that really scares me. I don't want to disrupt everyone's flight. We're taking a red-eye and everyone's going to try to sleep and I don't want a screaming baby. Obviously, there are things I can pack in my bag that will help, like Tylenol since Sonny is starting to teethe right now. I feel like having Tylenol on hand will give me peace of mind to know that maybe his pain can subside. Then I want to have his little toys to distract him and I'll make sure he is always changed and fed. I think having enough bottles and food for him to suck on during takeoff and landing will help because his ears can be uncomfortable if they're popping—it's really about anticipating all of those things.""  Throughout the chaos, she remembers what's important. ""As a first time mom, I feel like I'm constantly trying to stay 5 steps ahead. For example, Sonny may be fine right now but I'm always planning for when he starts crying, when he needs a bottle, when it's time for his next nap, and when he has to be changed. I think that it's so important to stop that for just a second and appreciate where you are and really stay in the moment. You can't control babies, they aren't robots and we don't have them all figured out. I think it's important for new moms to to be easy on themselves because it's obviously a high-stress time.""",real

In a recent visit to the company's headquarters, we chatted with a group of designers about how their process works.  Hidden away in the depths of Zara's sprawling headquarters in northern Spain, 300 designers are hard at work trying to discover the next big fashion trend.

Markle was raised in Los Angeles, California. During her studies at Northwestern University, she began playing small roles in television series and films. From 2011 to 2017, she played Rachel Zane on the American legal drama Suits. She is an outspoken feminist and has addressed issues of gender inequality, and her lifestyle website The Tig featured a column profiling influential women. She represented international charity organizations and received recognition for her fashion and style, releasing a line of clothing in 2016.  Markle was married to actor and producer Trevor Engelson from 2011 until their divorce in 2013. In 2017, she announced her engagement to Prince Harry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, and she moved to London. She retired from acting, closed her related social media accounts, and started undertaking public engagements as part of the British royal family. She became Duchess of Sussex upon her marriage to Prince Harry in 2018. They have a son, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor. In 2020, the couple announced their intention to step back as senior members of the royal family and split their time between the UK and North America.  Early life  Rachel Meghan Markle[1] was born August 4, 1981, in Los Angeles, California.[2] Her mother, Doria Ragland, is a former social worker and yoga instructor living in View Park–Windsor Hills, California.[3][4] Markle has often been described as having a very close friendship with her mother.[5] Her father, Thomas Markle Sr., lives in Rosarito, Mexico,[6][7] and is a retired television director of photography and lighting director whose profession resulted in his young daughter often visiting the set of Married...with Children.[8][9] Markle's parents divorced when she was six years old.[10][11] Her older paternal half-siblings are Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jr., from whom she is reportedly estranged.[12]  Markle is descended on her mother's side from enslaved Africans,[13] and on her father's side from European settlers.[14][15][16] She described her heritage in a 2015 essay for Elle magazine: ""My dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American. I'm half black and half white .... While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. To say who I am, to share where I'm from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.""[17]  Markle grew up in Hollywood.[18] She was educated at private schools, beginning at age two at the Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse.[19][20] Nick News with Linda Ellerbee profiled her successful campaign at age 11 to get Procter & Gamble to change a national television commercial that she viewed as sexist.[21] Raised as a Protestant,[22] she nonetheless attended Immaculate Heart High School, an all-girl Catholic private school in Los Angeles.[23] Markle was then admitted to Northwestern University, where she joined Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and participated in community service and charity projects.[24][25] She also served an internship at the American embassy in Buenos Aires,[26] and studied for one semester in Madrid.[25] She earned her bachelor's degree from Northwestern's School of Communication in 2003, with a double major in theater and international studies.[27][26]  Acting  Early in her career, Markle worked as a freelance calligrapher and taught bookbinding to support herself between acting jobs.[8][28] Her first on-screen appearance was a small role as a nurse in an episode of the daytime soap opera General Hospital.[29][30] Markle had small guest roles on the television shows Century City (2004), The War at Home (2006), and CSI: NY (2006).[30] She also took on several contract acting and modeling jobs, including a stint as a ""briefcase girl"" on the US game show Deal or No Deal.[8] She appeared in Fox's series Fringe as Junior Agent Amy Jessup in the first two episodes of its second season.[31]  Markle had some difficulty getting roles early in her career. In 2015, she wrote: ""Being 'ethnically ambiguous', as I was pegged in the industry, meant I could audition for virtually any role ... Sadly, it didn't matter: I wasn't black enough for the black roles and I wasn't white enough for the white ones, leaving me somewhere in the middle as the ethnic chameleon who couldn't book a job.""[32]  Markle appeared in two 2010 films, Get Him to the Greek and Remember Me, and one 2011 film, Horrible Bosses.[33] She was paid $187,000 for her role in Remember Me and $171,429 for her role in the short film The Candidate.[34]  In July 2011, Markle joined the cast of the USA Network show Suits. Her character, Rachel Zane, began as a paralegal and eventually became an attorney. She completed work on the seventh season in late 2017.[35] According to a critique in The Irish Times, Markle ""actively re-positioned"" her character from ingénue to ""the show's moral conscience"" and gave viewers the unique portrayal of a daughter whose African-American father is in a position to help her career and advance her ""desire to crack both racial and gender glass ceilings"".[36] While working on Suits, Markle lived for nine months each year in a rented house in the Seaton Village neighborhood of Toronto.[37][38] Fortune magazine estimated that Markle was paid $50,000 per episode, amounting to an annual salary of about $450,000.[39]  Personal life  Markle began a relationship with actor and producer Trevor Engelson in 2004.[40][41] They were married in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, on September 10, 2011,[42] and concluded a no-fault divorce in August 2013,[43] citing irreconcilable differences.[44] Markle's subsequent relationship with celebrity chef and restaurateur Cory Vitiello lasted almost two years, ending in May 2016.[45]  Markle and Prince Harry attending church on Christmas Day, 2017  In June 2016, Markle began a relationship with Prince Harry,[46] whom she had met on a blind date set up by a mutual friend.[47] At the time, he was fifth in line to the British throne;[48] his grandmother is Elizabeth II, queen of the United Kingdom and 15 other Commonwealth realms, as well as head of the Commonwealth.[49] In November, the British royal family's communications secretary released an official statement that addressed sexism, racism, and defamatory stories directed toward Markle.[50][51] In September 2017, Markle and Prince Harry appeared together in public for the first time at an official royal engagement at the Invictus Games in Toronto.[52][53]  Marriage to Prince Harry  Markle's engagement to Prince Harry was announced on November 27, 2017, by Clarence House and Kensington Palace.[46][54] The announcement prompted generally positive comments about the possible social significance of a mixed-race member of the royal family.[55] Markle announced that she would retire from acting,[56][57] and began the process of becoming a British citizen.[58] In preparation for the wedding, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, baptized Markle and confirmed her into the Church of England on March 6, 2018.[59] The private ceremony, performed with water from the River Jordan, took place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace.[59] The marriage ceremony was held on May 19 at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[60]  After the wedding, the Duke and Duchess originally lived at Nottingham Cottage in London, on the grounds of Kensington Palace.[61] The couple later moved to the more than two-centuries-old Frogmore Cottage in the Home Park of Windsor Castle.[62][63] The Crown Estate refurbished the cottage at a cost of £2.4 million, paid out of the Sovereign Grant, with the couple picking up expenses beyond restoration and ordinary maintenance.[64][65] Their office was moved to Buckingham Palace.[66] On May 6, 2019, the Duchess gave birth to Archie Mountbatten-Windsor,[67] who is seventh in line to the throne.[68]  Fashion and style  In 2014, Markle founded the lifestyle website The Tig, where she wrote about food, fashion, beauty and travel, and profiled inspirational women.[69] As the website grew, Markle brought in experts such as dieticians, make-up artists, and fitness and yoga instructors. The website's audience consisted primarily of the fans of Markle and Suits. Markle reinforced The Tig's messages of self-love, positivity, and spirituality on social media, reaching 3 million followers on Instagram, 800,000 on Facebook, and 350,000 on Twitter. She closed The Tig in April 2017, taking all of its articles offline, and deleted her social media accounts in January 2018.[70] It was estimated that, as a lifestyle blogger, Markle earned about $80,000 annually from endorsements and sponsorships.[34]  As editor-in-chief of The Tig, Markle became known for her fashion sense.[38] She released two fashion collections with Canadian clothing company Reitmans in 2015 and 2016.[70] The lines were based on her personal style and that of her Suits character, described as ""aspirational girl next door"", and quickly sold out.[38]  Markle has cited Emmanuelle Alt as her style inspiration.[71][72] In an interview with Glamour, the Duchess said that she favored ""that French way of styling, where if your outfit is pulled together, then something's got to be dishevelled—your hair, your make-up"".[71] In her youth, Markle's ""sensibility had always been relaxed California girl style"" consisting of jeans, cut-offs and flip-flops.[72] She usually prefers ""streamlined dresses"" with ""neutral colors"" and bateau necklines,[73][74] and likes ""monochromatic and tonal dressing"".[72] She has worn outfits and ensembles by a wide variety of fashion designers.[71]  In December 2017, Markle caused a surge in interest in Scottish retailer Strathberry after carrying one of their handbags to a public event shortly after her engagement.[75][76] This was reported as an indication that her fashion choices would produce her own version of the Kate effect.[75][77] After Markle and Prince Harry's first appearance as a couple, brands Mackage, Birks, R&R Jewelers, Crown Jewelers and Everlane noted an upswing in their website hits and sales.[78][79][76] It has been speculated that Markle's effect would be greater, as she has a strong appeal in America.[77] She caused a boost in the sales of yellow gold in the first quarter of 2018 in the United States.[80]  In 2018, Tatler named the Duchess on its list of Britain's best dressed people, praising her for redefining ""modern royal style with every subsequent appearance"".[81] Following the announcement of her pregnancy, the Duchess appeared in a Karen Gee dress that resulted in the breakdown of the designer's website.[82] She was ranked one of the best dressed women in 2018 by fashion website Net-a-Porter,[83] and was nominated for the 2018 Teen Choice Awards in the category Choice Style Icon.[84] In 2019, British brand Reiss reported a growth in profits, after the Duchess was seen wearing a mini-dress by them on International Women's Day.[85]  Public role  Markle greeting the public in Belfast, March 2018  Markle was politically vocal before joining the British royal family. She backed Hillary Clinton during the 2016 United States presidential election and described Clinton's opponent, Donald Trump, as ""misogynistic"" and ""divisive"". The same year, when the referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union resulted in 51.9% of voters being in favor of Brexit, Markle expressed her disappointment on Instagram and posted a placard saying: ""If EU leave me now, you take away the biggest part of me.""[86] This, as well as her recommendation of Noam Chomsky's book Who Rules the World?, led Emine Saner of The Guardian to write that Markle would become ""the most leftwing member of the royal family"".[87] Members of the royal family are politically neutral by convention, and Dickie Arbiter, former press secretary to Prince Charles, expects the Duchess to follow suit.[86] Historian Robert Lacey said she was the most ""feisty and spiky"" person to marry into the royal family since her grandfather-in-law Prince Philip.[86]  After the engagement, Markle's first official public appearance with Prince Harry was at a World AIDS Day walkabout in Nottingham on December 1, 2017.[88][89] The Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on March 12 was the first royal event she attended with the Queen.[90] The couple made their first visit to Northern Ireland on March 23.[91] Markle carried out a total of 26 public engagements prior to the wedding.[92]  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex welcomed to New Zealand, October 2018  The Duchess's first official engagement after the wedding came on May 22 when she and her husband celebrated the charity work of his father, Prince Charles.[93] Her first trip abroad at the request of the British government was to Dublin, Ireland, in July 2018.[94][95] The Duchess takes part in her husband's work as youth ambassador to the Commonwealth, which includes overseas tours.[96] The first such trip was to Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand in October 2018.[97][98] Despite public debate on the future of the monarchy in Australia, the couple were greeted by crowds in Sydney, and the announcement of the Duchess's pregnancy hours after their arrival was received enthusiastically by the public and media.[98][99] During their visit to Morocco in February 2019, the Duke and Duchess focused on projects centered on ""women's empowerment, girls' education, inclusivity and encouragement of social entrepreneurship"".[100]  In 2018, Time magazine included Markle on its list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World,[101] and placed her on its shortlist for Person of the Year.[102] She was also chosen as one of the most influential women in the United Kingdom by British Vogue magazine.[103] Her influence was also recognised in both the 2019 and 2020 editions of Powerlist, the 100 most influential Britons of African and Afro-Caribbean descent.[104]  As part of setting up their separate office or 'court' in 2019, the Duke and Duchess created an Instagram social media account, which broke the record for fastest account to reach 1 million followers.[105] In August 2019, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were criticized by environmental campaigners for using private jets regularly when taking their personal trips abroad, which would leave more carbon footprint per person compared to commercial planes. The criticism was in line with the reactions the royal family faced in June 2019, after it was revealed that they ""had doubled [their] carbon footprint from business travel"".[106][107]  The Sussexes' discontent with their public roles and unfavourable media scrutiny grew in 2019.[108] In May 2019, Splash News issued a formal apology to Harry and his wife for sending photographers to their Cotswolds residence, which put their privacy at risk. The agency also agreed to pay a ""substantial"" sum of damages and legal costs associated with the case.[109][110] At the end of their tour of Southern African countries in September–October 2019, it emerged that the Duchess was suing The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline over the publication of a letter she had sent to her father.[111][112] Seventy-two female British MPs sent a public letter of support to the Duchess, condemning the ""outdated, colonial undertones"" in the press.[113]  In January 2020, the Duke and Duchess announced that they were stepping back from their role as senior members of the royal family, and that they would balance their time between the United Kingdom and North America.[114] The couple also said that they would seek financial independence while continuing to support their charities and the Queen.[115] In the same month, the couple's lawyers issued a legal warning to the press after paparazzi photographs were published in the media.[116] The Duchess's final solo engagement as a senior royal was a visit to Robert Clack School in Dagenham ahead of International Women's Day. She and her husband officially stepped down on March 31.[117]  Charity work  Markle was a counselor for international charity One Young World.[119] At the 2014 summit in Dublin, she spoke on the topics of gender equality and modern-day slavery.[120] Also in 2014, she toured Afghanistan and Spain with the United Service Organizations.[121][122][123]  In 2016, Markle became a global ambassador for World Vision Canada, traveling to Rwanda for the Clean Water Campaign.[124][125][32] In 2016, after a trip to India focused on raising awareness for women's issues, she penned an op-ed for Time magazine concerning stigmatization of women in regard to menstrual health.[126] She has also worked with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women as an Advocate.[124][127] The Duchess is a vocal feminist and intends to use her role as a member of the royal family to continue supporting women's rights and social justice.[128] In 2017, Markle joined Prince Harry in teaming up with the charity Elephants Without Borders to assist with the conservation efforts taking place in Botswana.[129]  Markle became interested in the Hubb Community Kitchen, run by the survivors of Grenfell Tower fire, in January 2018. She visited the kitchen regularly throughout 2018, and suggested that the displaced women publish a cookbook to obtain funding for it.[130] Together: Our Community Cookbook, her first charity project as Duchess of Sussex, was announced in September.[131]  The Duchess's patronage of London's National Theatre, the Association of Commonwealth Universities, Smart Works, and Mayhew reflects her earlier interests in the arts, access to education, women's empowerment, and animal well-being, respectively.[132] The Duchess was appointed the vice president of the Queen's Commonwealth Trust, which focuses on projects involving children and welfare of prisoners, in March 2019.[133] In October 2019, the Duchess voiced a Public Health England announcement with other members of the royal family for the ""Every Mind Matters"" mental health program.[134]  In 2019, the Duchess became a contributor and guest editor for the September issue of British Vogue and highlighted the works of 15 women from different areas, who were described as ""Forces for Change"".[135] Edward Enninful, editor-in-chief of the British Vogue, later revealed that the issue had become the ""fastest-selling issue in the history of British Vogue"".[136] In the same issue, it was revealed that she had collaborated with a number of British fashion houses and stores to launch a capsule collection, called The Smart Set, in September 2019 to benefit the charity Smart Works, of which she is a patron. The collection sought to help ""unemployed and disadvantaged women"", through selling items ""on a one-for-one basis, meaning an item is donated for each item purchased"".[137] Taking advantage of ""the Meghan effect"" (driving consumer purchases), in 10 days the collection provided a year's worth of clothes for the charity.[138]  In March 2020, it was announced that the Duchess would serve as the narrator of Disneynature's documentary Elephant. The proceeds from the documentary will be donated to Elephant Without Borders in order to help elephants in Botswana.[139][140]  In February 2018, Markle attended the first annual forum of The Royal Foundation.[141] After her marriage into the royal family, the Duchess became the foundation's fourth patron, alongside Prince Harry, his brother Prince William, and sister-in-law Catherine.[142] In June 2019, it was announced that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would split from the charity and establish their own charity foundation by the end of 2019. It was reported that the couples would collaborate on mutual projects, such as the mental health initiative Heads Together.[143][144] In July 2019, Harry and Meghan's new charity was registered in England and Wales under the title ""Sussex Royal The Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex"".[145] However, on 21 February 2020 it was confirmed that ""Sussex Royal"" would not be used as a brand name for the couple following their step back from public life as working royals.[146] In April 2020, responding to inquiries from The Telegraph, the couple confirmed their new foundation would be called ""Archewell"".[147] The name stems from the Greek word ""arche"", which means ""source of action""; it is the same word that inspired the name of the couple's son, Archie.[147]  In April 2020, Meghan and Harry volunteered to deliver foods prepared by the Project Angel Food to Los Angeles residents amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.[148]  Titles, styles, and arms  Upon her marriage to Prince Harry, Meghan Markle became a princess of the United Kingdom entitled to the style of Royal Highness, as well as Duchess of Sussex, Countess of Dumbarton and Baroness Kilkeel.[149][150][151] She is styled as ""Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex"",[152] the first person to hold that title.[153] Following a decision to step back from royal duties, she and her husband have agreed not to use the style ""Royal Highness"" from early 2020, although they still retain the style.[154][155][156]  Filmography  Television  Film  Authored articles  See also",fake

Kendra’s Faking It for TV.”  “2. Yes we are having issues,” she continued. “3. My job has been reality tv for 13 years 4. My show was a comedy and light hearted til sad times happened then we had to change my show from comedy to drama. Not what i wanted but was a part of my journey and story.”  In a fifth point, Kendra shared that “these issues Hank n I are having in our home which we are tryin to hard to over come, everyone knows about, including producers and network, friends and family.”  “6.

2277,"I thought this book was well researched and a fascinating snapshot into the PR machine that is ""brangelina"". The author goes to great lengths to infiltrate many organisations including the psychiatric hospital where Jolie stayed as an inpatient, to discover the truth about this famous couple. While the book is heavily centred on Jolie (with Pitt starring more in a supporting role- perhaps because his background is rather more typical and therefore, less interesting) I thought the book was very fair on both of them- it doesn't refute the fact that they are both talented, intelligent and loving parents devoted to their humanitarian causes, but it does debunk alot of the saccharin rubbish that is continually pumped out by their PR. For example, I laughed at Halperin's description of how they refuse to allow their nannies to be photographed when they are all on family outings to give the impression that they do everything for the kids when its blatently obvious that noone- not even a superwoman, could look after 6 children, do back to back movies and travel with UNICEF all at the same time. It also emphasised the downside of their fame mentioning how shiloh referred to her nanny as ""mummy"" as she spent most of her time with her instead of Jolie.    Much is also made of their philanthropic efforts but then, surely if you have as much wealth as they do, you would have to have a heart of stone and no social conscience whatsoever to see the horrific poverty in Africa and other parts of the world and then spend $5,000 on a handbag. I just like this book for debunking the myth that celebrities are perfect when in fact they hire PR and management specifically to manipulate the press and to portray a certain image- most of it is smoke and mirrors. After all, if this book was truly slanderous then why didn't they sue?  I just think this book balances out the hollywood hype and shows us that celebrities have their own issues, problems and sruggles just like the rest of us.",fake

Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids. Perhaps staying in Los Angeles is her way of making sure Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox continue to have a relationship with their father? Either way, the house is insane — check it out in the gallery above.  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Angelina’s new house? Do you think she’s prepping for a wedding?",fake
4953,"Have you ever had an unexpected run in with an old co-worker? In the latest trailer for Marvel's Thor: Ragnarok, Thor finds himself fighting the Hulk in a massive battle arena. The gladiator-esque face off is not exactly a warm reunion between two former Avengers, and it creates a lot of questions. At first Thor seems relieved to run into a familiar face, even if that face is enormous, angry, and green. For a small moment it appears the superhero might be in the clear, but that would be too simple, and the Hulk doesn't seem to recognize his old pal. Instead, the Hulk charges full throttle toward Thor, and right before the two meet in the air the trailer cuts to black.  So, what's going on here? It's clear that something fishy is afoot, or the Hulk wouldn't be trying to clobber a superhero he used to fight evil with. It might have a lot to do with the Grandmaster, a decadently dressed yet rather sinister new villain played by Jeff Goldblum. The Grandmaster seems to be orchestrating this whole fight, and can be seen looking on in disapproval from a skybox above the arena. The big mystery is how the character got the Hulk to turn on a friend. ""Oh, come on,"" Thor says in frustration as the Hulk growls at his friendly approach, and as viewers, we can relate.  Of course, the face off between Thor and the Hulk isn't the only excitement in the new trailer. This is the big reveal of Cate Blanchett's Hela, the Asgardian goddess of death, a character expected to challenge the series' protagonist in a major way. ""She plays the worst of the worst. So evil,"" Mark Ruffalo, who plays the Hulk, described Blanchett's character in an interview with ET Online. ""She is going to kill us. It's such a great part she gets to play.""  Even without Blanchett's Oscar-winning acting, the film is packed with stars. Tom Hiddleston reprises his role as Loki, who can only be back once more to try and defeat Thor. It also appears Benedict Cumberbatch will make a high-profile appearance as Doctor Strange, and Tessa Thompson (Creed, Westworld) will play the Asgardian superhero Valkyrie. Anthony Hopkins will once again appear as Odin, and Idris Elba returns as Heimdall. On the performance front, this is not the Marvel movie to miss.  Let's just hope that the Hulk recognizes Thor at some point, because it looks like the hero might be in a bit of trouble. It's going to take a lot to defeat Blanchett's Hela, who was a scary enough villain before they introduced that hat with the evil mutant deer horns and thorn studded sword in this trailer. That's not to mention the evil work of Loki and the Grandmaster, who are just two more obstacles in the way of saving Asgard.  The film hits theaters on November 3, 2017, and director Taika Waititi has promised in interviews that even for a superhero movie, it will be truly strange and ""out there"". This first look trailer definitely supports that claim, but let's just hope we get a few more answers before the movie premieres in the fall.",real

4365,"No doubt, you are still distraught after learning nearly a week ago that Selena Gomez broke up with Justin Bieber.  Nothing make sense anymore: Black is white, up is down and you are questioning if love even exists. Well, hold on tight, because things are about to get even crazier when it comes to ""Jelena"" breakup rumors.  The pop-star power couple are splitsville now, but rumors that Bieber, 18, proposed to his 20-year-old girlfriend, not once but twice, in the months before the breakup are gaining traction. Proposal rumors developed out of a blind item from earlier this month, and there is talk that their relationship began as a PR arrangement -- which was fine for Gomez, who saw it as a job from the get go -- but Bieber actually fell for her and wanted to make things official.  This isn't the first time we've heard that their relationship was a publicity stunt and it's not the first time we've heard engagement rumors. There were multiple reports the couple was engaged or that Bieber had proposed throughout their nearly two year relationship, and more recently it was reported that Gomez's team had encouraged her to stay with Bieber because it was good for her brand.  While the proposals are likely a bit of a stretch, it definitely sounds like Gomez wasn't as into the relationship as the teen pop star and she also wasn't about to be made a fool of, because of his tendency to flirt with other women.  According to Gossip Cop, Gomez had ""trust issues"" with Bieber, but she also wasn't able to spend as much time with him as he wanted. Sources told the website that the teen heartthrob was ""very needy,"" and ""constantly complaining” for her to “make time for him.""  Multiple sources told E! news that the breakup was ""a long time coming"" and jealousy had been building up for some time between the pair.  Though it was a photo of Biebs with model Barbara Palvin that sparked rumors he'd already moved on, sources say it was a photo of Gomez kissing her ""Parental Guidance"" co-star Nat Wolff that set the couple on rocky ground. The kiss happened while the actors were filming a scene, but it sounds like Bieber and Gomez have been playing a game of emotional chicken -- trying to see who can make the other jealous.  ""They're young. Of course they have their jealous streaks. Justin has gotten jealous, and so has Selena,"" a source told E! News.  Their relationship sounds less than ideal, so it's not shocking that Gomez would want out. RadarOnline is also reporting that jealousy contributed to the downfall of ""Jelena,"" and sources say that Bieber has promised he'll stop texting other girls if Gomez takes him back.  ""He is texting her like crazy trying to stay in her good graces,"" the source told the website. ""If either one of them slows down and they actually have the chance to spend time together again, they will end up back together.""  Bieber is reportedly desperate to get back with Gomez, but it doesn't look like the breakup has slowed him down -- at all. The pop star has kept himself busy by posting shirtless photos to Twitter, riding around on his $20,000 Ducati, and hanging out with Ashley Olsen at a Textile Elizabeth & James event -- that's just weird.  UPDATE: Selena must be tired of the constant texts she's reportedly getting from the Biebs, as sources tell TMZ she's spent the last day blocking her phone number and other communication devices so he can't contact her. Though she's still following him on Twitter, the source says she wants no contact with the pop star. It's not surprising, since sources also say the breakup ""absolutely, positively involved another woman.""  PHOTO GALLERY Justin Bieber & Selena Gomez's Couple Style",fake
16665,"Travis Scott won’t have his name dragged through the mud. The 25-year-old rapper has fired back at “wannabe promoters” with a countersuit after being sued for cancelling a February 3 Super Bowl LII concert in Minneapolis.  In a Tuesday, April 17, counterclaim obtained by Us Weekly, Scott claims that Minnesota-based promoters Alex Martini, Jefferson Agar and Patrick Johnston failed to set up travel arrangements for his return to Los Angeles following the performance.  Scott’s attorney, Howard King, state that the men — who run events company PJAM LLC — breached their contact and owe the entertainer a balance of his fee.  King called Martini, Agar, Johnston and Johnston “three wannabe promoters” in a statement to Us Weekly.  “In an obvious effort to shake Travis down and avoid the consequences of their breaches, they filed a spurious lawsuit while spreading falsehoods in the press,” said King in the statement. “Rather than suing, these so-called promoters hold have apologized and taken responsibility for their inability to provide the agreed-upon transportation.”  King added that Scott “apologizes to any fans who were duped by these promoters into showing up at the cancelled show even after the promoters failed to take the steps to get Travis there.”  As previously reported in March, PJAM claims it paid Scott a $150,000 advance of his $200,00 performance fee for a show at Myth Live Nightclub in Maplewood, Minnesota, one day ahead of the February 4 Super Bowl. In addition, his agent reportedly received a $10,000 booking fee and had arranged for a private jet to fly Scott to the venue.  TMZ reported in March that the “Goosebumps” rapper bailed because his and Kylie Jenner’s daughter Stormi was born on February 1, two days before the scheduled show.",real
505,"Just when it seemed things couldn’t get any worse.…They did. Capping of a tumultuous week of bizarre rants and a Trump-related Twitter firestorm, Kanye West showed up in the TMZ newsroom on May 1 and dropped a few new bombshells. During a rambling 42-minute interview, the erratic rapper announced that he’d been hooked on opioids after liposuction in 2016 and declared that ""when you hear about slavery for 400 years…that sounds like a choice."" His shocking comments were met with instant backlash from fans, fellow celebrities and especially his own wife, Kim Kardashian.  ""She’s just so mad at him for embarrassing her — and her family — over and over and over again,"" says a Kardashian source, noting that Kim is fearful about how Kanye’s behavior affects everything from their children to the Kardashians’ public image and business empire. The pair fought bitterly, adds an insider, because ""Kanye was furious that she would even try to silence him. He stormed off, leaving Kim in tears."" Now with Kanye, 40, holed up at a Wyoming resort — purportedly to work on his music — Kim, 37, is facing the fact that her third marriage is in free fall. ""She’s more humiliated than ever,"" says the source. ""Her sisters and mom, Kris Jenner, are asking her how much more of this she can take.""  She’s put up with so much already. ""Kim has tried to talk to Kanye about the effect his words are having, not only on his friends and his fans, but on those closest to him,"" says the insider, noting that she’s been living in fear for the family — including kids North, Saint, and Chicago — after rapper Daz Dillinger urged the notorious Crips gang to “f— Kanye up.”  While Kanye brushed of the danger during his TMZ rant, he and Kim did appear to beef up security, says the insider: ""They’re taking this very seriously."" All of the Kardashians are on red alert. ""This is most definitely a family crisis,"" says the insider. ""Everyone has been in heated conversations, trying to figure out how the hell to shut Kanye up."" And how to keep the family businesses running smoothly.  ""Kim hopes people won’t hold Kanye’s actions against her,"" says the source, ""but Kris has been on the phone tirelessly with the execs they work with to make sure that there are no problems."" Kim is already breathing a little easier now that Kanye’s out of town. ""It’s way less stressful,"" says the source, noting that they hardly speak when he’s working. ""She wants to unwind and not make any rash decisions. But just having him out of LA has already been great for her mental state. And she’s doing whatever she can to be vocal about how Kanye’s opinions are NOT hers.""  But Kim knows his actions reflect on her — and she’s got a big decision to make about their future. As embarrassing as it will be for the reality star to have ""a third failed marriage under her belt,"" says the insider, ""there’s no coming back from Kanye’s latest meltdown. It’s time for Kim to not only distance herself from Kanye, but to make it offcial and divorce him.""  For more on this, pick up the new issue of In Touch magazine, on stands now!",fake
2614,"Slow your roll ‘Baywatch’ fans. Alexandra Daddario is squashing claims that she’s loved up with costar Zac Efron.  Alexandra Daddario, 32, wants to make something very clear: She’s not dating Zac Efron. Yes, he was her love interest in the 2017 Baywatch film but the actress claims that, in real life, they’re just “good friends.” Alexandra clarified their relationship in an interview with PEOPLE. Crushing the hopes of Baywatch fans everywhere, she said on May 31, “We’re very good friends. Zac and I’ve worked together, and we’re very good friends.”  It’s not the first time that Alexandra has claimed that Zac, 30, is in the friendship zone. In May 2017, she told E! News, “We work together closely; he’s my love interest in the film. I understand why people would go crazy over something like that, but Zac and I are very good friends.” So, what happened? Alexandra’s comments don’t match what HollywoodLife and other outlets have been told about the status of her relationship with Zac. In April a source EXCLUSIVELY told us that the actress has been “very coy” about their rumored romance. The person added, “But people that are close to her know that this a defense mechanism because she really wants it to work and doesn’t want anything to get in the way of a great love match. She wants to make it look like she is single in public but is 100 percent all about Zac and the relationship they are brewing.”  If we take Alexandra at her word, she and Zac have definitely – at the very least – formed their own mutual admiration society. On March 16, he posted a tribute to the actress on his Instagram page. Next to a photo of them together, he wished her a “Happy Birthday” calling her the, “most real, down to earth, stunning, intelligent, creative, loving and most rare Pokemon ever created.” And on April 4, when Alexandra posted a photo of her looking at her dog on Instagram, he commented, “Two hot b*tches.” Because, with flirting like that, of course people wouldn’t think they’re dating.

11224,"Selena Gomez‘s red carpet looks are never anything less than stunning, and last night was no exception. On Monday, the 25-year-old singer attended the 3rd annual InStyle Awards in Los Angeles, where she turned heads in an adorable little black dress, gold hoops, and smudgy purple eye makeup. And though Gomez kept things simple up top, the bottom half of her body was a completely different story.  For shoes, the “Fetish” singer wore mismatched heels. On her right foot, Gomez sported a strappy sandal with a bright yellow ball as the heel, while the singer’s left foot was elevated by a trapezoid-shaped wooden box. And though the shoes complement each other with similar children’s blocks-shaped heels, they are far from identical.  As unconventional as Gomez’s heels were, she wasn’t the first to sport them. In early October, three weeks ago, Emily Ratajkowski wore the exact same pair when she was attending a party for Paris Fashion Week. However, instead of Gomez’s LBD, the supermodel opted to go lighter with an oversized white shirtdress. She also kept the mismatched theme going with different dangly earrings. On one ear, Ratajkowski sported a gold square, while the other flaunted a silver circle.  Of course, both women looked equally incredible, and likely inspired legions of fans to mismatch their shoe collection as well. Plus, there’s a bright side to someone having the same mismatched pair as you. When you get bored with not matching, you can always swap shoes to complete your pair. Given that Ratajkowski and Gomez are friends, the ladies might be on the same wavelength.",real
2016,"After several months of the couple trying and failing to keep their relationship on the down-low, we now know that Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx are dating.  We still don't know exactly how long the actors have been together, but it seems they're moving very quickly.  Despite the fact that Foxx doesn't even tell his friends about Holmes (The man is seriously committed to maintaining his privacy.), sources say the relationship is already very serious.  In fact, sources are now claiming that there's a very good reason Holmes and Foxx decided to finally go public with their relationship last week.  According to Australian tabloid NW, Holmes and Foxx are expecting a child together.  Insiders tell the magazine that the pregnancy was planned, and Katie is roughly three months along.  ""Katie had always wanted to have another baby and knew her biological clock was ticking - and, at long last, it's happening!"" says one source.  Noting that Holmes described the pregnancy as ""perfect timing,"" the insider adds:  ""Katie's always wanted a sibling for Suri and now she'll have a little sister.""  We'll hold off on offering out congratulations until the news comes from a source that's slightly more credible than a random Australian tabloid.  That said, we wouldn't be surprised if it turns out there's some truth to these reports.  After all, Katie and Jamie are both devoted parents, and sources close to the couple have confirmed their relationship is very serious.  Plus, after the experience of having a child with Tom Cruise, we imagine Katie would like to find out what child-rearing is like when you're not under 24-hour surveillance from a cabal of cult leaders.  Just kidding, Scientologists! Please don't sue us!  Anyway, sources say that in the years after her split from Cruise, Katie pretty much holed up and devoted herself thoroughly to being a mom.  These days, she's loosening up a bit, and her loved ones credit Foxx with teaching her how to relax and have fun.  “She was a homebody,” says one insider.  “It’s great to see her out and having fun, and I bet Jamie has played a big part in that.”  Hopefully, the knowledge that everyone will now be scrutinizing her midsection in search of a baby bump won't stop Katie from continuing to go out and enjoy herself.",fake

But for Victoria Adams, then known as Posh Spice, it turned out to be a key moment in her personal life too.  The video would soon catch the eye of Premier League soccer player David Beckham, who immediately picked out the brunette Spice Girl in her black PVC catsuit and matching gloves.  He declared: “That’s the girl for me and I'm going to get her! She's my idea of perfection. I knew that if she wanted me, we would be together forever.”  They later met at a Manchester United soccer players’ lounge, where it was love at first sight—although Victoria later admitted she was a little tipsy at the time.  The couple married in 1999 and had four children; sons Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper. The pair have also forged a successful brand over their almost 20-year marriage, with Victoria starting a successful fashion label after attempting a less-than-stellar solo music career.

If there’s one person the Kardashian clan wants to stop from spilling their family secrets, it’s Blac Chyna, 29. She’s currently at war with her ex and baby daddy Rob Kardashian, 30, and has taken out a restraining order against him that has already led to dramatic claims of violence and suicide attempts. The last thing the family wants is more publicity towards this ugly feud, and Kim Kardashian, 36, wants to make sure her hubby Kanye West. 40, doesn’t escalate matters by starting a rap war with Chyna. Especially since she’s starting a new career as a hip hop artist.  “Kim is a bit disturbed with Blac Chyna’s recent legal action towards the family and she wants to avoid any talk or interaction with Chyna at all costs. She has already told Kanye time and time again not to rap about her in any future music to the point it would affect their relationship in a bad way if he crossed Kim on this request,” a source close to the reality star tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  “She doesn’t want any reference to Blac Chyna either positively or negatively in any of Kanye’s music because that lives forever and she would rather have Chyna in the background and out of her family’s life as much as possible moving forward,” our insider adds.” Chy has claimed in court papers that Rob was abusive to her and threatened suicide several times. Not to mention, she has 11-month-old daughter Dream by Rob and a child with Kylie Jenner’s ex Tyga, 27, so she’s totally intertwined with the Kardashian crew. See Chyna’s court papers documenting her claims against the family, here.  So far Chyna has already spilled in court documents obtained by HollywoodLife.com, that she alleges that the Kardashian family was responsible for using their “power and influence over the E! network to kill the second season,” of her reality TV show with Rob. She also claimed to have texts that said Rob was going to kill himself, multiple times and said he knocked her to the ground in front of her son by Tyga, four-year-old King Cairo.

Get The Christian Post newsletter in your inbox. The top 7 stories of the day, curated just for you!  Delivery: Weekdays  There are rumors that ""The Big Bang Theory"" actress is getting ready to start a family with her husband, Ryan Sweeting. The couple has just bought Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom's former home in Tarzana, California, and according to reports, they have converted what used to be Odom's man cave into a nursery.  Though Cuoco is not pregnant as of the moment, fans of the actress are supporting her if ever she does decide to have a baby anytime soon. For now, Cuoco is busy filming the eighth season of ""The Big Bang Theory"" and caring for her dogs. The actress is also a known advocate for animal rights and adoption of rescue dogs, and she has been seen frequenting events which support those causes.  Recently, the actress made headlines when she successfully secured a new contract for the show, with the actress now set to earn $1 million per episode. Her cast mates Johnny Galecki and Jim Parsons were also able to negotiate their contracts for the same amount of money.  Though she's now one of the highest paid actresses on television, she appears to still enjoy going out and about on her usual activities. On Monday, Cuoco was seen in a flowing pink maxi dress while leaving her yoga class in Los Angeles. She was seen carrying three bags, a rolled-up yoga mat, and a lime green water bottle. Her hair, which is cut in a pixie style, appeared to be slightly damp after her workout.  In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, she explained the need for her drastic makeover as the actress is known for her flowing blonde locks.  ""I talked to the producers [of Big Bang Theory], I have this idea to cut my hair and I cut it really short but it was for a movie over the summer,"" said Cuoco. ""I had a talk with the writers who loved it and they were great about it and they said 'I think it will be a great change for Penny and the show.' They were really cool about it and on my side when they wrote it in, so I got lucky!""",fake
2710,"Anna Wintour Net Worth and Salary: Anna Wintour is an American magazine editor and fashion news icon. Anna Wintour has a net worth of $50 million. Her annual salary as Editor of Vogue is $4 million. She is considered one of the most influential figures in the fashion industry. She served as the (albeit not very flattering) inspiration for the popular novel and movie The Devil Wears Prada.  Her career began in the world of fashion before moving into journalism, largely at the behest of her parents. Her father Charles Wintour was the editor of the London Evening Standard for nearly two decades.  In 1970, Wintour was hired on as an editorial assistant for the new Harper's & Queen fashion magazine. Even at this early stage of her career, Wintour divulged to coworkers that she had the desire to edit Vogue, a desire that would grow to be fulfilled nearly 20 years later. Wintour introduced sweeping changes to Vogue from her first issue forward. Many of these changes could be seen right on the cover. Wintour favored more naturalistic photography of lesser-known models outside, as opposed to the tight headshots the magazine had previously favored. Additionally, Wintour's first Vogue cover was also the first to feature a model wearing jeans, with the added bonus of wearing a bejeweled T-shirt valued at around $10,000. Under Wintour, Vogue has continued to be one of the pillars of fashion journalism.",fake
322,"Ahead of his 55th birthday, Johnny Depp more determined than ever to maintain his youth. He’s even having a ‘bit of a mid-life crisis’ over the possible effects of aging, HollywoodLife has EXCLUSIVELY learned.  Johnny Depp has been indulging in quite the rockstar life while on tour with his band, Hollywood Vampires, and it’s left fans worried for his health. However, HollywoodLife has learned EXCLUSIVELY that there’s a reason he’s pushing so hard to keep up with the demanding lifestyle. “Johnny’s 55th birthday is this Saturday [June 9] and, like most of us, he doesn’t like getting older,” a source close to the actor tells us EXCLUSIVELY. “He is accustomed to being adored and has been named Sexiest Man Alive twice, so he likes doing the rockstar thing and living the life he’s always led because he doesn’t feel 55 or want to be 55.”  Our insider says this desire to live the life of an ultimate rockstar may have contributed to the skinny, gaunt look Johnny recently debuted, which has fans concerned about his health. “He wants to be forever young, so he is doing things that make him feel young,” our source adds. “So what we might be seeing is the start of a little bit of a mid-life crisis for him.” As we previously reported EXCLUSIVELY, Johnny is totally unbothered by all the talk surrounding his appearance, as it’s the exact look he’s going for as the frontman of his band.  Still, that hasn’t stopped those close to him from worrying about the effect this rock ‘n roll lifestyle will have on his health and well-being. “He’s partying hard,” another source previously told us. “When Johnny’s single, he doesn’t have anyone to reign him in, and he can get pretty wild when let to his own devices.”",fake

The pair, who welcomed daughter True on April 12, were seen walking into the celebration for their pal Savas, a.k.a Rich Youngin, in Cleveland. In photos posted by the Daily Mail, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star, 33, could be seen wearing black pants and a black long-sleeve top, over-the-knee boots, a Panama hat and large hoop earrings, the Cleveland Cavaliers player, 27, was dressed down in a blue and grey tracksuit and baseball cap.  E! News reports that Kardashian threw the party for their friend at the Marble Room and the group of about a dozen people celebrated over dinner in a private room.  Both the Good American designer and Thompson shared videos on their Instagram Stories of Savas being presented with a birthday cake decorated with a shirtless photo of him, while another video posted on Instagram showed them standing together at the celebration.  “This is what you’re gonna look like, Savas,” Kardashian told her workout buddy of the six-pack abs depicted on the cake.  As Us Weekly exclusively reported, the new mom has put her boyfriend’s infidelity in the past and a source told us they are “fully back together,” despite the fact that he cheated on her with at least five women while she was pregnant.  Kardashian has remained in Cleveland since giving birth to their daughter, but her mom, Kris Jenner, told Us earlier this month that the Revenge Body host is due to move back to L.A. very soon.  She also told Us on Friday, June 8, that she stands by her daughter’s decision to stay with the power forward. “I think you just have to be there for your kid and follow their lead,” the momager said. “I’m not in that relationship or in that situation, so I really trust Khloé.

8171,"We were swimming our second lap in the lake when I lost the feeling in my toes. When you first jump in water this cold you scream, gasp for air, but immediately laugh because it makes you feel extra-alive. You learn, after a few jumps, you don't have to fear the cold. If you move around, it fades away. Soon, it's as if you're inside a house looking out at a snow flurry as it lightly taps the windows. You know there is cold, all around you, but it can't hurt you.  For a while, this kind of numb makes me feel invincible.  But now, after maybe a half-hour in the water, the cold has returned, and not just outside the window, it's in my skin. Beneath the surface, I probably looked like a chicken breast sitting under plastic in a refrigerator of a grocery store, pale and goose-pimpled. Then it's in my joints, making it difficult to move. Soon, it's in my bones, so much that even though I knew I was kicking my legs, I couldn't tell you where they ended and the water began. I wasn't even sure if I had toes anymore.  Suddenly, I'm in very familiar territory. I know I should get out of the water before I hurt myself or make myself sick, but I just don't. I keep swimming.  Here I am, 31 years old, and I'm still denying my body the one thing it is asking me to do: take care of it.  ***  When I shot the pilot of Pretty Little Liars, it was December in Vancouver, and I was 24 years old. We were shooting a summer scene (the exterior of the funeral for Alison, the Queen Bee of Rosewood), and even though I don't remember exactly how cold it was outside, I can tell you it was too cold to snow. The girls and I were dressed in skimpy black dresses with kitten heels and ballet flats. Later, in editing, they could push the saturation, add a golden filter, and BAM, it would look like we were sweating in July. But while we were shooting, well, it was December in Canada.  ""Rolling!"" yelled the assistant director, and wardrobe would rush in and apologetically remove the giant down coats from our shoulders. Everyone watched, hoping we could get the scene before our jaws locked or our shoulders unintentionally rose around our ears. Eventually, Leslie, our director, yelled ""Cut!,""and the beautiful warm jackets reappeared.  Wanting to be the most professional I could be, I sniffed back the snot that was threatening to ruin every take and forced my shoulders to stay where they were, even though I could see my breath on the air. I looked around: Lucy, Ashley, and Shay all seemed cold but fine; they looked professional, powerful. Was I not cut out for this? I pushed that thought out of my mind. Suck it up, Bellisario, do your job.  There came a point when I mentioned offhand, ""Huh, I can't feel my feet."" ""Stop!""a voice screamed, and an angel in the form of a crew member descended upon me and demanded I follow her inside the church we were shooting near.  She sat me down, removed my shoes, and began to rub my feet. She asked me to let her know when I had feeling in them again. ""Don't worry about my feet! They're fine!""I tried to sweetly wiggle away from her, my eyes flitting to the crew that was waiting nearby. I was holding up production, a production that costs thousands of dollars per minute, all for my stupid comment about my stupid toes. I started to panic: Everyone is going to think I'm a diva, that I can't hack it, that I'm a horrible actor, and they'll never want to work with me again.  I am practiced at ignoring [my disease], for the most part, but it's still there, finding new ways to undermine me.  But the angel remained resolute. She told me that she had worked with people who had lost toes to frostbite, and she wasn't about to see me lose mine. Eventually, I announced (truthfully) that the feeling in my feet had returned, and she let me go.",real

After agreeing to allow Bravo cameras to film her interaction with Bethenny Frankel and her husband Bobby’s funeral, Jill Zarin’s name immediately went to the top of the list.  Housewives head honcho, Andy Cohen, added fuel to the fire when he was asked about a possible return for Zarin at the Tribeca TV Festival’s Tribeca Talks: Ten Years with The Real Housewives of New York City. After comparing being a housewife to being in the mob, Cohen stunned fans be seeming onboard with the idea.  “And regarding Jill, I was happy to see she and Bethenny [Frankel] have that moment last season. And, as I said, I was happy it happened in front of a camera, actually, just as a fan of the show and their kind of evolution,” he shared. “But never say never. I think it would be cool.”  Frankel ended her long-standing friendship with Jill Zarin following Season 3 of the Real Housewives of New York and left the show to start filming a spin-off. During that time Frankel also went on the launch her billion-dollar Skinnygirl company.  Zarin has popped up a couple times since she was let go from the cast in 2011.  Zarin went to lunch with Dorinda Medley and Luann de Lesseps in Season 9 and Frankel was the hot topic of conversation due to her fight with Ramona Singer at Medley’s home in the Berkshires.

But Sonja Morgan and Dorinda Medley both revealed they would love to see her come back.  Advertisement  Season 11 of the Real Housewives of New York will premiere in the spring of 2019.",real

On Wednesday, Kardashian West posted a nude, behind-the-scenes selfie of her body covered in glitter.  “I named my product[s] after his song,” Kardashian told Refinery29. “Because I heard it and I was like, ‘Oh shit — someone needs to name a highlighter Ultra Light Beam,’ and so I did.”  Looking for more style content?

You can even use the highlighter as a shadow on the eyes and then add the gloss on top. It’s really versatile.”  This comes after the successful launches of her KKW Beauty Contour Kits and KKW Fragrance, which sold out all three fragrances (Crystal Gardenia, Crystal Gardenia Citrus and Crystal Gardenia ) in six days for about $14 million in total.  Though Kardashian West has yet to preview the products themselves, fans got a first look at the highlighters and glosses thanks to makeup artist and beauty influencer Huda Kattan, who was the first to show off the never-before-seen products from KKW Beauty on Monday.  As seen in Kattan’s photo, each product comes in sparkly copper, bronze, rose gold, gold and silver tones, meaning you can match lip glosses and highlighting powders.

4709,"It took Kelly Ripa more than a year to find the right co-host for Live after Michael Strahan unexpectedly left for Good Morning America. Now, her incredible chemistry with Strahan’s replacement, Ryan Seacrest, is undeniable, but in the midst of the sexual misconduct allegations against him, Ripa is feeling betrayed and torn about standing beside him. Could these skeletons in Seacrest’s closet force Ripa to leave the popular morning show?  According to Life & Style, in the era of the #MeToo and #Time’sUp movements every business is playing it safe, and that means things could change at Live, especially if ratings start to drop and big names start to avoid the show.  “[Kelly’s] waiting to see what happens with Ryan. But [either way] this is a dark period for her,” reveals an insider. “She’s pissed…Kelly feels blindsided. The last thing she needs is celebrities boycotting. Everyone is on pins and needles.”  At this point, Ripa and Seacrest are still interviewing A-listers on the show, but that wasn’t the case when he was on the Oscar red carpet earlier this month. While hosting the E! Live from the Red Carpet Oscar special, Seacrest obviously had a slow night after publicists decided to steer their clients away from him because of the sexual misconduct claims.  This resulted in a 43 percent drop in ratings in key demographics compared to 2017, plus a 35 percent drop in overall number of viewers.  Ripa and her husband, Mark Consuelos, did walk by and acknowledge Seacrest by telling him he looked amazing and was doing a great job, but that doesn’t mean she still isn’t conflicted about the allegations.  She does want to side with her co-host, but no one thought he had any skeletons in the closet, and everyone is asking if he knew this was going to come out.  Ripa did seemingly take a dig at Seacrest on the show late last month when she asked him if he wanted her to put his shoes back on after they talked about having a treadmill day on the show. It seemed to be a reference to the allegations against Seacrest that included him pushing his accuser’s head towards his crotch while she tied his shoes.  But, the next day, Ripa told audiences that she fully supported her co-host, saying that she adores him, and it is a privilege to work with him, and those words led Seacrest to tears.  Oscar emcee Jimmy Kimmel also had no problem talking with Seacrest and avoiding jumping to any conclusions about the allegations. He said that we should afford people the opportunity for truth and find out the facts before hanging someone out to dry.

15871,"Late night host James Corden has the best answer if his children ever ask him about gay relationships.  They haven’t yet because gay people have always been a part of their lives.  Corden opened up about their family life and raising his children to be accepting in an Attitude interview.  ‘They haven’t brought it up, but we have lots of gay friends – like our friends Chris and Mark – who have come over a lot and stayed with us,’ he said. ‘I think my son has never questioned it as it’s always been there.’  Corden, who’s currently the host of The Late Late Show, has three children with his wife Julia Carey.  If any of his children ever ask, though, he has the perfect answer.  ‘I would know what those answers were, which is that these are simply two men that really love each other in the same way I love Mummy and Grandma loves Grandad and that’s it.’  That’s a perfect answer.  Born that way  Corden added ‘no one is born wanting to dislike anyone’ and his parents raised him to be accepting. Now it’s a lesson he’s passing on to his own children.  His support of the community is nothing new.  Soon after Trump wanted to ban trans soldiers from the movie, Corden did a number supporting trans troops.  The interview describes him as an LGBT ally and he said he has an affinity with the community. However, he’s aware of his own privilege too.  ‘I’ve always looked different, not the societal ideal, but I’ve never felt like an outsider to the extent that my gay friends have felt. It would be naive of me to think I have.’",real

The protests, which are ongoing, have so far led to more than 20 arrests, and 10 police officers were reportedly injured on Friday night, though many, of course, are also demonstrating peacefully.

The same cops whose actions sparked the protests.”  @RachWhittBarnes tweeted to the group, “@U2 Since you’re free tonight, I hope you’ll join in the protest at 5pm downtown. I’m sad to miss a show, but this is more important.” @isk9 argued, “People in St. Louis are b**ching because U2 canceled their show tonight? Get over yourselves, a cop got away with murder. Be pissed at that.” Still, others were dealing with logistical issues. @sparks4kids told the band, “We never received an email from Ticketmaster saying show was canceled but did receive an email about which entrance to use. #u2Stlouis.” @atu2comSherry also pointed out, “@Ticketmaster needs to catch up w/U2’s cancellation announcement – it seems tix holders haven’t been directly notified.”  “Feel just awful for all the #u2fam missing out on the gig In StLouis. Especially ones that this was only show. But #u2 had no choice,” commented @thedoorsdf71. @MeganClontz17 shared, “Sorry that this had to happen for those of you planning on going.

He said 'when you have children of your own, you realise you are responsible for their lives in a way you haven't been before, and you become conscious that you want to make an example of your own life that they will follow.'  However, Star claims that George is not taking his role as a father seriously enough.  'Amal has told him over and over not to ride scooters, but he refuses!' says the source, who adds that she 'blew up at him after the accident but he kind of smiled and shrugged it off.'  The source claims that while Amal was by George's side shortly after the accident, helping him onto a private plane leaving Sardinia, she's since left - and has taken the twins with her.  'She's telling friends she hopes the absence helps make him see things her way.'  'Amal is pretty clear about what she expects from George as a father and a husband,' says an insider, who adds that while Amal hasn't filed divorce papers, she's 'privately consulted a lawyer', Star's source explosively alleges.

It will be the second child for both, and marks a new chapter in their notoriously private relationship. Here's the story of how the two Hollywood stars got together, from the early days of friendship to tying the knot.    They have been friends for decades  This celebrity marriage might have come as a surprise to many, but in a 2012 interview with Marie Claire, Weisz revealed they had known each other for years. When asked if it was love at first sight with Craig, she responded: ""I'm going to change the subject... It wasn't really like that. We'd been friends for ages.""  Both started their film careers in the early 1990s and had previous long-term relationships. In 1992, Craig married actress Fiona Loudon, with whom he had a daughter before divorcing in 1994. Weisz began dating American filmmaker and producer Darren Aronofsky in 2001. Their son was born in 2006.  Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig at a screening of ’Enduring Love’ in New York, September 2004. Getty Images  Their romance reportedly started on a film set  In 2010, the thriller Dream House brought the two together. They played a married couple, with tabloids reporting that there was a chemistry between the actors on set in Canada. They made headlines in November that year when Weisz split from her partner of nine years, Darren Aronofsky. Despite rumours of their romance and a few paparazzi photographs of the co-stars together, both denied their relationship.    The relationship moved quickly  In June 2011, it was confirmed that Craig and Weisz had married in New York with just four guests present, including his daughter and her son. It came just six months after their relationship was first reported.  The couple are seen in the East Village on in March 2013. Getty Images  ""We did it privately and we've got a lot of people to thank for that,"" said Craig in a 2015 interview with GQ. ""But that was the point; we did it for private reasons. The whole point is that it was a secret. A secret is a secret"".  Both have remained very quiet on the subject of their wedding, but in a recent interview with The Evening Standard Magazine, Weisz said: ""I wear my ring with pride.""  Marriage came naturally for the couple  In the same interview, Weisz explained that she never planned on marrying the James Bond star. ""I never thought I would get married,"" she said. ""It was not an ambition of mine. It was the opposite. I couldn’t relate to romantic comedies — marriage seems to be the whole point of them... Then it just happened, happily, at a more mature moment.""  At the 2013 Oscars. Getty Images  They leave work at work  ""I don’t talk about my work, and nor does he. It’s very private,"" Weisz told The Sun in 2013. ""There is nothing worse than two actors getting together and talking about acting. It’s like the end — it’s the worst.""  As for being married to one of the most famous fictional characters of all time? In her 2017 interview with Harper's Bazaar, Weisz said: ""I did Lorraine [the ITV breakfast show] this morning, and she said, 'So, you're married to Bond!' And I said, 'No, I'm married to someone who pretends to be that character'.""  At The 11th Annual Night of Opportunity Gala in New York, April 2018. Getty Images  They like the quiet life  Aside from the odd red carpet appearance, the couple, who live in New York, like to keep a low profile. ""I love to cook.

1116,"Does Kourtney Kardashian and Younes Bendjima’s social media snafu meant they’re on the rocks? Scott Disick hopes so, as we’ve heard he’ll gladly ‘ghost’ Sofia Richie if Kourt’s single again.  When Kourtney Kardashian, 38, deactivated her Instagram and her boyfriend, Younes Bendjima, 24, made his account private, many thought there was trouble in paradise between these two. While everything seems to be back to normal, Scott Disick, 34, certainly hopes something is up, as a source close to “The Lord” EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com that he’s praying “that Kourtney unfollowing Younes on social media is the beginning of the end for Kourtney and her boy toy. Scott has never stopped loving Kourtney and he always will.” Uh-oh. Well, bad news for Scott: Kourt’s back on the ‘gram and following Younes.  Looks like Scott’s ready to swoop in the second Kourt’s back on the market. Wait. What about Sofia Richie? Scott has had quite the love affair with the 19-year-old. They’ve travelled the world and were even seen having lunch together a few weeks ago. Will Scott stay by Sofia’s side if his baby mama suddenly becomes Younes-less? “If it turns out Kourtney is single again,” the insider tells HollywoodLife.com, “you can bet that Scott will ghost Sofia and start spending more time at home with Kourt and the kids. As much fun as Scott has been having with Sofia, he still loves Kourt very much and would love to put his family back together.”  That’s….actually a bit harsh for Sofia. Even if this romance with Scott is “just a phase,” like her father Lionel Richie said it is, she doesn’t deserve to get ghosted by Scott the moment Kourt is single. Plus, even if she and Younes have split, it’s not like she’s going to throw open the doors and welcome Scott (and all his problems) back in her life. “The Lord” might want to take a hint and let go of those reconciliation dreams of his.  Also, with Scott ready to spend more with his ex and the kids, Sofia might want to hold on making any long-term plans with her current boyfriend. “Scott has been in a lot of pain since Kourt began sleeping with Younes,” the insider added, “and he’s has been waiting for the day that she deletes him from social media. Scott is hopeful that this as a major sign that it’s the beginning of the end for Kourt and Younes.”",fake

1335,"Now that it was clear that this was not just a university romance, aides at the Palace suddenly started paying attention to the middle-class girl who had so captured the prince’s imagination. Mindful of the mistakes that had been made with Diana, it was unanimously agreed that Kate should be introduced to royal life as quickly as possible. At William’s request, it was decided that Kate should be advised on how to cope with the intense media interest in her. He was determined that she should suffer none of the loneliness or isolation his mother had felt in the early days of her courtship with his father. Kate was given the support of the Prince of Wales’s press team and, when she was with William, her own protection officer. At a polo match she was spotted with a two-way radio in case she required backup. She received advice on how to handle the photographers who followed her about, which included watching footage of the late Princess of Wales to see how she had coped with the paparazzi. According to friends, Kate found it all fascinating if “a little creepy.”  Even without a ring on her finger, Kate had become one of the world’s most photographed women, and she was surprisingly confident. Always impeccably dressed, she was advised never to talk to the press, but to politely smile at photographers, whom she handled with aplomb. She had recently taken a day job at the head office of the High Street store Jigsaw, where she was working as an accessories buyer, and she was looking forward to spending time with William over Christmas.  William had promised Kate he would join the Middletons to celebrate Hogmanay, the Scottish New Year, at a country estate called Jordanstone House, and Kate was eagerly awaiting his arrival. The 18th-century property, on the outskirts of Alyth, was set in snowy countryside. A Christmas tree twinkled in the grand drawing room, and with fires burning in every room, the setting could not have been more romantic. But at the last minute William had a change of heart and decided to stay with his own family instead. According to a source close to the family, he informed a tearful Kate during a late-night conversation on Boxing Day. For William it was no big deal, but for Kate the cancellation was a sign of something more sinister to come. She had good reason to be concerned. William had been having second thoughts and sat down with his father and his grandmother to have a frank discussion about his future with Kate. Both advised him not to hurry into anything.  Kate turned 25 on January 9, 2007. The day before, William had joined the Blues and Royals regiment of the Household Cavalry at Combermere Barracks, in Windsor, where he would be stationed until March. They had had a joint celebration at Highgrove before he reported for duty, but Kate was still reeling over the snub in Scotland. In the newspapers, however, the engagement rumor was gathering momentum once more. Kate’s birthday was preceded by an article written for The Spectator by Diana’s former private secretary Patrick Jephson in which he claimed that Kate was on her way to becoming a royal bride. Under the headline THE NEXT PEOPLE’S PRINCESS, the article was highly speculative, but there was no doubting the thrust—William was set to make Kate his wife, and her 25th birthday looked like a likely date for an announcement. The story snowballed, and by the morning of Kate’s birthday dozens of photographers were camped outside her house waiting for the “pre-engagement picture.” The rumors could not have been further from the truth—William had no plans to propose. Instead, he phoned Kate from the Combermere Barracks to apologize. William was furious that Kate’s birthday had been spoiled, and in an unprecedented statement he complained that she was being harassed and said he wanted “more than anything” for her to be left alone. For the first time Kate felt overwhelmed and desperately isolated. Usually she smiled brightly for the photographers, but now as she made her way to work in central London she looked as though she was about to crack under the pressure. Those close to the couple began to speak of doubts about their relationship. The Palace’s plans for a spring wedding were shredded as quickly as they had been drawn up, and the talk now, among their friends at least, was that an engagement was certainly not in the cards. William had started a two-and-a-half-month tank commander’s course at Bovington, and although the couple took a skiing trip to Zermatt with friends in March, he and Kate were spending less time together. He had warned her that his schedule was packed and he would have little time to visit her. She was upset when William came to London and went clubbing instead of seeing her. On one occasion he spent the night at Boujis flirting with another girl. William was with a group of friends when Tess Shepherd walked into the club. The petite blonde knew some of William’s circle, and before long she and William were on the dance floor, arms entwined.",fake
19355,"""He's home with the kids and picking the boys up from school,"" says Cavallari  With a booming company, hit TV show and three young kids, Kristin Cavallari makes doing it all look like a breeze — but she couldn’t do it without her husband Jay Cutler.  “We’ve definitely switched roles which has been really interesting, but it’s great,” Cavallari, 31, told PEOPLE at the Los Angeles pop-up of her store Uncommon James at The Grove. “I couldn’t do any of this without him. He’s home with the kids, picking the boys up from school and really allowing me to be able to have the time and freedom to do all this. He’s been really supportive.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The slower pace of life is a huge change for Cutler, 35, who up until 2017 had a nonstop football career. On the first season of Very Cavallari, the couple — who are parents to sons Camden, 6, and Jaxon, 4, and daughter Saylor, 3 — often joked about the athlete’s excess of free time.  “I call him my farmhand because he’s been planting trees around the house. He’s been taking care of all the animals,” says Cavallari, who recently moved with her family into a new home in the Tennessee countryside. “I’m just giving him time. I’m not gonna pressure him. He worked his ass off for so many years, so I get that all he’s ever known is football. He’s gonna figure it out.”  Image zoom Todd Williamson/Getty  The former Dolphins quarterback quickly became a fan favorite on Very Cavallari thanks to his dry humor, and Cavallari says he’s now fully embraced his new role.  “Coming from the football world where people didn’t get his personality, it’s been really nice for me and him [to have fans] appreciate him and see the real side of Jay,” she says. “He’s been having fun with the show. Now that he sees he had a really positive reaction, he’s been having a good time with it.”  Though they often reference their three kids on the show, the couple choose to keep their children away from the spotlight — though they know exactly what’s going on.  “We try to limit the time we shoot at home, and the boys are at school and Saylor takes a three-hour nap every day, but when they are home they love watching the monitors,” she says.  Image zoom Kristin Cavallari Courtesy Uncommon James  Usually filming four days a week, Cavallari says shooting the show has been easier than expected. “The Hills was a breeze ’cause we filmed three days a week, and it was three scenes and very regimented,” she says about her former MTV home. “This isn’t bad either. It’s nice for me because I’m killing two birds with one stone. It’s about my company and these are my real employees. I go into the office and handle business, and there happens to be cameras there.”  The reality star recently launched Little James, a baby-focused spin-off of her brand Uncommon James, and Cavallari says she’s excited to outfit her friend’s children — including the Hills castmates like Heidi Pratt and Audrina Patridge.  Her own kids are the fit models for the line, and “I really asked for their opinion,” adds Cavallari. “The great thing about them is they’re very opinionated … but they’re good sports about everything.”  RELATED VIDEO: Kristin Cavallari Reveals the Only Two Laguna Beach Alums She Follows on Instagram  When the reboot of The Hills airs next year, Cavallari says she’ll definitely be watching. “There’s a part of me that’s really sad I can’t be part of the show, but Heidi and I have joked that maybe we could swap an episode.”",real
2741,"Leonardo DiCaprio enjoys meeting beautiful women on boats – anyone who has ever seen paparazzi photographs of the 41-year-old in his spare time could tell you that. But despite the endless run of supermodels, actresses and socialites who have latched on to his arm on various vessels over the years, only one (his mother aside), seems to have stayed the course. And she just so happens to have been the first, too.  Yesterday, as Sunday night’s action from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood was digested, social media melted with nostalgic pride at clips of Kate Winslet, DiCaprio’s original maritime fling, watching her old friend sate his two-decade hunger for an Academy Award, with his performance as a post-watershed Ray Mears in the 19th-century survival epic the Revenant.  There was Leo, trussed up in a dinner jacket and reciting his speech with all the calm and poise of a man who has had too much time to practise, when the camera deliberately cut to a tearful Kate (herself a nominee, losing to Alicia Vikander in the Best Supporting Actress category).  Eyes fixed on stage, hands clasped in prayer, rocking back and forth: in another context, Winslet might have looked more like a deranged racehorse owner – but this was the Oscars, so any melodrama is forgiven.  As the footage circulated online, the internet briefly averted its gaze from Donald Trump, and oohed and ahhed with glee.  “LEO AND KATE ARE SO CUTE,” one person calmly Tweeted. “They are the pinnacle of friendship goals,” another concluded. Thousands of similar messages followed. Forget the prizes, controversies, dresses and jokes the night threw up, for many viewers the highlight of the 88th Academy Awards was the enduring tale of a strictly platonic friendship forged 19 years ago, on the deck of the Titanic.  Of course, both actors’ careers could easily have easily sunk with James Cameron’s epic story of that ill-fated cruise liner. Neither DiCaprio nor Winslet was an established lead when they were cast as Jack and Rose, so when Cameron’s film ran both well over-budget and far beyond schedule, that lack of star power was just one of many reasons industry critics doubted its success.  More fool them: Titanic became the first movie to gross more than a billion dollars, and instantly made the pair (then only 21 and 22 respectively) two of the most bankable actors in the world.  Looking at images of them together on the red carpet at the 1998 Oscars, they could scarcely seem further from the slick, seasoned professionals of 2016. DiCaprio has the air of a 12-year-old wearing his father’s spare suit to a school ball; while Winslet, in dark lipstick and black lace, looks more 'tormented adolescent going through a Goth phase’ than Hollywood star.  Photo: REX/Shutterstock  Still, that early success set them on course for careers of impressively even stead: both became critically acclaimed as well as box office stars, and for a long time both were united in an inability to claim the biggest prize of all, despite regular awards nominations (including Golden Globe nods for Revolutionary Road in 2008, their first on-screen reunion since the mid-Atlantic).  Things didn’t stay quite so even in their personal lives - while Winslet married for the third time in 2012 (guess who walked her down the aisle?), DiCaprio continues his diligent quest to date every model on earth for at least an evening.  When Winslet eventually got her Oscar for The Reader in 2008, at her sixth time of trying, DiCaprio was there at the front, cheering loudly. Last night, as he achieved his own dream, she did the same. Little wonder the world should feel warmed.  Floating selfishly on that Titanic door (which Jack could easily have squeezed onto), all those years ago, Rose might have reneged on her promise to never let go, but in real life, the pair never drifted apart. And now they’ve finally been reunited in the Oscars hall of fame.",fake

Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her.

11082,"I did not see Harvey again until September 2013 when I was in Toronto for the premiere of “12 Years a Slave,” the first feature film I was in. At an after-party, he found me and evicted whoever was sitting next to me to sit beside me. He said he couldn’t believe how fast I had gotten to where I was, and that he had treated me so badly in the past. He was ashamed of his actions and he promised to respect me moving forward. I said thank you and left it at that. But I made a quiet promise to myself to never ever work with Harvey Weinstein.  Not long after I won the Academy Award in 2014, I received an offer to play a role in one of the Weinstein Company’s forthcoming films. I knew I would not do it simply because it was the Weinstein Company, but I did not feel comfortable telling this to anybody. I turned down the role, but Harvey would not take no for an answer. While at Cannes, he insisted on meeting with me in person. I agreed to do it only because my agent would be present. In the meeting, he was honest about intending to persuade me to do his movie. I told him I simply did not feel it was a role I needed to play. He said he was open to making it bigger, more significant, maybe they could add a love scene. He said if I did this one for him, he would do another one for me — basically guaranteeing backing a star-vehicle film for me. I ran out of ways of politely saying no and so did my agent. I was so exasperated by the end that I just kept quiet. Harvey finally accepted my position and expressed that he still wanted to work with me at some point. “Thank you, I hope so,” I lied.  And that was the last of my personal encounters with Harvey Weinstein. I share all of this now because I know now what I did not know then. I was part of a growing community of women who were secretly dealing with harassment by Harvey Weinstein. But I also did not know that there was a world in which anybody would care about my experience with him. You see, I was entering into a community that Harvey Weinstein had been in, and even shaped, long before I got there. He was one of the first people I met in the industry, and he told me, “This is the way it is.” And wherever I looked, everyone seemed to be bracing themselves and dealing with him, unchallenged. I did not know that things could change. I did not know that anybody wanted things to change. So my survival plan was to avoid Harvey and men like him at all costs, and I did not know that I had allies in this.  Fortunately for me, I have not dealt with any such incidents in the business since. And I think it is because all the projects I have been a part of have had women in positions of power, along with men who are feminists in their own right who have not abused their power. What I am most interested in now is combating the shame we go through that keeps us isolated and allows for harm to continue to be done. I wish I had known that there were women in the business I could have talked to. I wish I had known that there were ears to hear me. That justice could be served. There is clearly power in numbers. I thank the women who have spoken up and given me the strength to revisit this unfortunate moment in my past.  Our business is complicated because intimacy is part and parcel of our profession; as actors we are paid to do very intimate things in public. That’s why someone can have the audacity to invite you to their home or hotel and you show up. Precisely because of this we must stay vigilant and ensure that the professional intimacy is not abused. I hope we are in a pivotal moment where a sisterhood — and brotherhood of allies — is being formed in our industry. I hope we can form a community where a woman can speak up about abuse and not suffer another abuse by not being believed and instead being ridiculed. That’s why we don’t speak up — for fear of suffering twice, and for fear of being labeled and characterized by our moment of powerlessness. Though we may have endured powerlessness at the hands of Harvey Weinstein, by speaking up, speaking out and speaking together, we regain that power. And we hopefully ensure that this kind of rampant predatory behavior as an accepted feature of our industry dies here and now.  Now that we are speaking, let us never shut up about this kind of thing. I speak up to make certain that this is not the kind of misconduct that deserves a second chance. I speak up to contribute to the end of the conspiracy of silence.",real

1773,"Depending on how you look at it, Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner are the most famous members of their family. Some favor Kim over Kylie and vice versa, but one thing Jenner has surpassed Kardashian in is her net worth. On July 11, Forbes revealed its new cover for the ""America's Women Billionaires"" issue, and Jenner is front and center. The outlet reports that thanks to Kylie Cosmetics, the new mom is almost a billionaire. People on Twitter started pitting the sisters against each other over their money, but Kim Kardashian's tweet about Kylie Jenner's Forbes cover shows that she's the farthest from jealous someone could get: she's proud.  When the Forbes cover was released on July 11, Jenner posted the cover to her Instagram in a moment of pride. She said, ""wow. i can’t believe I’m posting my very own @forbes cover. thank you for this article and the recognition. I’m so blessed to do what i love everyday. i couldn’t have dreamt this up! #KylieCosmetics."" The article finely outlines Jenner's net worth as a result of Kylie Cosmetics, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, her and Kendall Jenner's PacSun clothing line, and her other various money-making schemes, and she's worth $900 million. Kim Kardashian, on the other hand, is worth $350 million, according to Forbes.  It's not like either of those numbers are small or unimpressive, but nevertheless, people on Twitter started trolling Kardashian and Jenner, many joking that Kardashian must be extremely jealous that her youngest sister ended up more successful than her (money wise).  This is Kylie Jenner's Forbes cover.  And here's what Twitter had to say about it.  Lots of people (including Dictionary.com) are arguing that Jenner isn't self-made at all. I mean... I feel like it's obvious that she's objectively not. She was born into a famous family, was on KUWTK because it was about said famous family. Jenner has 100 percent taken the fame she already had and used it to her advantage better than any of her siblings, but self-made? Nah.  Dictionary.com trolled Jenner in the most savage way when this cover came out.  The account quoted Forbes tweet of Jenner's cover and said, ""Self-made means having succeeded in life unaided. Used in a sentence: Forbes says that Kylie Jenner is a self-made woman."" The (pretty true) shade! Jenner is a hard worker, no doubt, and the success of Kylie Cosmetics is thanks to her, but the literal definition of ""self-made"" consists of not having any help. You can't really be self-made when you're born into fame and then you use that fame to your favor. More power to Jenner for creating one of the most successful makeup companies in the world, but that success is in part thanks to the fact that she was born with more privilege than most.  One person who has no issue with Jenner's success, however, is Kim Kardashian.  Kardashian tweeted Jenner's Forbes cover not once, but twice. Her first tweet said, ""CONGRATS @KylieJenner"" with three flame emojis. The second said ""Wait I'm posting this again just because!!!! BILLION DOLLAR BABY"" with a bunch of emojis. Kim K has no time for people saying she's jealous. (She also posted a video on her Instagram story in honor of Jenner.)  One fan came to the family's defense about their work ethic and the doubt about their success.  The tweet said, ""The Kardashian Jenner women are the smartest, hardest working women that I know. They are the first to start their work day before the sun rises and always the last ones to end it. Debate and hate all you want but their success and longevity is no accident."" Kardashian quoted the tweet with three clapping emojis.  Whether you think Kylie Jenner is ""self-made"" or not, one person we can thank for all of this is Kris Jenner. Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and the Devil may work hard, but Kris Jenner works harder.",fake
8361,"Charlize Theron has officially weighed in on the possibility of playing a female version of James Bond. Daniel Craig is still playing 007 for now, but James Bond 25, which is set to arrive in theaters next November, is said to be his last. That means, the franchise is heading for a reboot in the next couple of years and there's been talk, mostly from fans, about having a female Bond. Theron's name has been thrown around and now she's addressed the possibility.  During a recent interview, Charlize Theron was asked about playing James Bond. Nobody involved with the franchise, as far as we know, is actually looking at a female to play 007 in the future. Nor is there any indication Theron has been specifically approached, but her name has been bandied about, largely thanks to her roles in movies like Mad Max: Fury Road and Atomic Blonde. Theron says she likes the idea of going against type, but she feels she's too old for the part. Here's what she had to say about it.  ""You know, I don't have a feeling about it one way or the other. I love the idea that people are thinking outside the box. And I know for a long time people were talking about Idris Elba for it. And it's just nice to see people now thinking outside of [these] confined ideas of what we think a character can be. I'm really all for that. I think it's great that we are developing more characters within that genre for females, that they can take ownership. So it's a really nice thing for people to say. I'm very old, though. I would be a very old James Bond.""  Charlize Theron has made quite the name for herself as a female action star in recent years, so it's understandable that if a gender-swapped version of James Bond is on the horizon, her name would be at the top of people's lists. Some fan art depicting her as the iconic MI6 spy even made the rounds online last year. Gillian Anderson from The X-Files is also a favorite for the part and she's even shown support for the idea.  As Charlize Theron points out, Idris Elba has been a name thrown out over the years, which also would represent a change for the character, as James Bond has always been portrayed as a white man. In regards to her being too old? That's not necessarily true. Daniel Craig is going to be 50 by the time James Bond 25 gets going and Roger Moore played the part until he was 57. That said, Theron, who is now 42, would be in her mid-40s by the time the opportunity came up, which may be a bit old for someone to start their tenure as the new 007.  The producers of the James Bond franchise are going to have a tough time following up Daniel Craig and one way to gain some attention would be to try something different. Though, gender-swapping one of the most iconic characters in cinema history may turn more fans off than it would bring to the franchise. At the very least, some changes could be coming. Producer Barbara Broccoli said last year that she's open to have a female direct a future Bond movie, which could help bring some new perspective to the character and the franchise. In any event, it doesn't sound like Charlize Theron plans on putting on a tux and taking out bad guys with a Walther PPK in the future. This news comes to us courtesy of Yahoo.",real
4373,"There are some things in life we humans accept to be true.  The sky is blue. The earth is round. Bachelor in Paradise is kinda weird.  Khloe Kardashian being pregnant, it would seem, is not one of them. Yes, that’s right.  Despite the fact the 33-year-old appears to be very, very with child – literally WEEKS from popping out a tiny infant – the internet is building a case to support their unusual theory that Khloe has been faking her pregnancy for months on her momager Kris’ orders in the name of publicity.  We are 99.83 per cent sure this theory is completely and utterly bogus. But that .17 per cent of us that lives for these kinds of wild conspiracies urged us to sort through all the facts for ourselves.  Thus began our investigation into whether one Khloe Alexandra Kardashian is actually pregnant.  Part One: The initial reports from Blind Gossip.  This theory all began with a single report from gossip website Blind Gossip saying the reason for Khloe’s delayed pregnancy confirmation was because she was not really with child.  “People think that she is just waiting to be safe before she confirms the pregnancy. She actually is not even pregnant! She is just stretching out the rumours as long as possible because of publicity,” the site reported a source said.  Credible, no?  Logical explanation:  Thankfully we didn’t have to dig too deep to figure this one out.  Khloe explained exactly why she kept her pregnancy news to herself for so long in an Instagram post in December 2017, saying “we wanted to enjoy this between our family and close friends as long as we could privately. To enjoy our first precious moments just us.”  Fair enough.",fake
12483,"Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle seem to be two of the biggest fashion icons of the moment. Though they have both worn some memorable ensembles, it looks like Markle may have had a bigger year than her royal sister-in-law when it comes to influencing the latest trends.  Both duchesses made it onto global fashion search platform Lyst's new ranking of the most powerful celebrity fashion influencers of the year, with Markle landing in a higher spot on the list than Middleton.  The list was generated by tracking more than 100 million searches and using sales data, page views, and social media mentions to determine each celebrity's influence. Kylie Jenner nabbed the top spot on the list, followed by her sister Kim Kardashian West.  Markle was found to be the third most popular celebrity fashion influencer of 2018  Boat neck dresses have become one of Markle's signature styles.

Nigel Roddis/Getty Images  According to Lyst's findings, Markle caused a huge spike in search traffic for certain brands and designs  Both Givenchy and Stella McCartney saw boosts in traffic following the royal wedding. People were also searching for ""boat neck"" and ""tuxedo dress"" designs.

Steve Parsons/WPA Pool/Getty Images  The list also cites that every time Markle wears a designer, that brand name will see more than a 200% spike in search results over the following week.  Markle caused a spike in searches for tuxedo dresses. WPA Pool/Getty Images  Middleton may have landed lower on the list than her new sister-in-law, but her influence is still going strong  The data showed that the bright pink Mulberry coat she wore in January inspired over 10,000 searches that month. The coat was actually first seen in 2014, proving that her penchant for outfit recycling still maintains its influence.  Read more: 35 stunning looks Kate Middleton repeats again and again  Middleton's bright pink coat was a huge hit. Eamonn M. McCormack/Getty Images  A Brand Finance survey from back in October named Middleton as the most popular royal influencer of the year, so results seem to vary based on the data. It's also worth noting that Middleton was out on royal maternity leave for much of the year after giving birth to Prince Louis in April, so she debuted fewer new looks than Markle.  Either way, both duchesses seem to be providing fashion inspiration in their own way.  Visit INSIDER's homepage for more.",real

They were reportedly spotted kissing during a group dinner on Jan. 26 at Taix French Restaurant in Los Angeles, a witness told Wonderwall.com. “They were making out,” an onlooker told the website.

The Twilight actor ended his engagement to FKA Twigs, 30, in Oct. 2017, and, as we’ve previously reported, he started getting close with the “Swish Swish” singer in the aftermath of the split. “Rob’s been talking and texting with Katy, and they’ve become super super close,” a source close to Rob previously told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “There’s always been a really strong chemistry between them, and a definite attraction, but they’ve never acted on it, because all the time they’ve known each other one or other of them has been involved with someone else.”  The pair have both been single since his breakup with his former fiancée, but Rob didn’t immediately try to start a new relationship last fall out of respect. “There’s no doubt that he’s really into Katy, and that he fancies her like crazy, but, he’s determined to not get in to some kind of rebound romance — he respects and cares about Katy way too much to risk blowing the friendship they currently have,” our insider added. The American Idol judge was last romantically involved with Orlando Bloom, 41, but they ended their relationship in Feb. 2017.

Recently, news broke that Jolie had been seeing a new man, amid rumors that Pitt has been dating new people too.

Getty Images  The Sun is also reporting that the divorce is imminent, and that the progress Jolie and Pitt have made is actually really positive: ""It’s a huge turnaround from where the marriage ended, especially given the claims Angelina made against Brad, but they are now on pretty good terms.""

18410,"The recent allegations of Hollywood star Morgan Freeman sexually harassing women has shocked many of his fans. Now, American TV host and writer Janet Mock has revealed that just a few years ago when she interviewed Freeman, she too had an unpleasant experience. In a new interview , she described him as 'the creepy uncle at the barbecue'.Janet, who was at the time working as an on-air reporter, sat down with the veteran actor to discuss his film '5 Flights Up' (2014). In a newly published clip of their interview, you can see him asking her, ""How you all manage to do that all the time?"" When she asked him if he was talking about hair and make-up, he responds, ""No, you got a dress that's halfway between your knee and your hips and you sit down right across from me and you cross your legs.""According to Janet, Freeman knew the camera was rolling. She told a reporter later that this shows how men in power believe that they have free rein to do whatever they want. She believes that as a young woman who was just trying to do a job as a reporter, she just wanted to interview him for the movie and so, for him to turn into the 'creepy uncle at the barbecue' was strange.",real

10861,"Dolly Parton is a country music legend, gifted with extraordinary talents since a young age. Have you noticed she is ALWAYS wearing long sleeves no matter the temperature? Ever wondered why? This is the reason…        It Started At A Young Age  Dolly’s upbringing certainly contributed to secrets she has kept hidden. She is passionate feminist, refuses to wear any clothes that reveal her arms, and has kept her private life on the down low despite her fame. To understand why she is the way that she is, you need to know about her childhood….  So Many Siblings!  Before fame, Parton was “dirt poor.” She was in Tennessee on January 19, 1946. Did you know she has 12 siblings?! Her father worked as a farmer and construction worker, and her mom took care of the kids. The entire family had to live in a one-room cabin.  The Church Was Her Stage  The Parton family were regular churchgoers, and it was a huge part of Dolly’s childhood. When she was just six, she began performing in front of the congregation. Two years later she was gifted her first guitar from her uncle. The rest is history! She started performing on local TV and radio shows.  Johnny Cash’s Advice  When Dolly was only 13, she sang at the legendary country music venue the Grand Ole Opry. After meeting Johnny Cash backstage, told her to never give up on her dreams, no matter how big they were. He also told her to trust her own instincts and to not get pushed around by music industry executives.    Moving to Nashville  After graduating high school in 1964, she moved to the epicenter of country music: Nashville. Despite her talent, she had a hard time at first. Parton started out by just composing songs for other artists with her uncle Bill Owens. Together they composed two top ten hits.  She Gets A Record Deal  Dolly signed with Monument Records when she was only 19 years old! However, their vision wasn’t exactly what Dolly had in mind for herself. They wanted her to be a squeaky clean pop artist who appealed to the teenage market. She recorded some singles, but none of them were successful.  She Makes A Change  You could definitely say the pop music world’s huge loss was country music’s gigantic gain! After Dolly composed Bill Phillips’ biggest hit ever, she went on to sing some simple harmonies for him. This allowed her to transition from pop to country music. The first two country singles she released were huge hits!  On The Wagon  With her country music career blossoming, Parton was asked to appear on The Porter Wagoner Show. This performance is considered to be the launch point for Dolly’s flourishing career. Initially, her appearance was not a success and she was actually replaced with singer Norma Jean. However, the audience came to greatly prefer Dolly and were very vocal about it.  Going Solo  Parton and Wagoner put out a number of songs together until she left the show in 1974. She was then signed to label RCA Victor. Her very first single, “Just Because I’m A Woman” only reached the #17 spot on the charts. She released a number of other solo singles in the late 60s, but none were as successful as the work she did with Wagoner.    At Last  Wagoner had an idea to help Dolly become the star she dreamed of being. He convinced her to record her own version of “Mule Skinner Blues,” originally a hit for Jimmie Rodgers. Finally, her solo career took off and the song hit #3 on the charts! She then recorded her first ever #1 single, “Joshua.” She continued to top the charts in the following years.  Tough Love  Despite the success of their collaborations, Parton and Wagoner often clashed about the direction of Dolly’s career. Over time, it became evident that Dolly needed to leave, but Wagoner sued her for a breach of contract when she tried. In an attempt to tell him how she would always feel, she had him take a seat as she sang “I Will Always Love You.”  Her Biggest Hit Yet  “Coat of Many Colors,” is regarded as one of Dolly Parton’s signature songs, but it actually only reached #4. In the late 70s, she released her biggest hit ever, “Jolene”. Not only did it soar straight to the top of the country charts, but it was a big success in the UK.  Back To Pop  While she hadn’t experienced much success with pop music, that didn’t stop her from trying again in the late 70s. She first started to work with Sandy Gallin, who went on to be her manager for the next 25 years.  Here She Comes Again  Dolly continued to aim at appealing to a more mainstream audience. She released “Here You Come Again,” which sold over 1 million copies! It just shot up to the top of the country charts and also reached number 20 on the pop charts! There was even bigger success to follow. One of her most successful songs actually weren’t composed by herself, it was written by Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann.  Award Winning!  It was actually not until the late 80s that Dolly Parton became a huge star. She released the album “Trio.” It spent an amazing 5 weeks on top of the country charts! Her streak didn’t stop there! Later in 1999, she was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. She went on to greate more Grammy-award winning albums with her unique Bluegrass style.  We Will Always Love Her!  As she started her career as a songwriter, it shouldn’t be shocking that some of her songs have been covered by other huge stars. Who could forget when Whitney Houston sang “I Will Always Love You,” for the film “The Bodyguard.” Also, Kenny Rogers and LeAnn Rimes have their own versions.  The Oscars Come a Calling  Dolly Parton hasn’t only won a series of music awards, but also she has been nominated for Academy Awards. Her song “9 to 5” was featured on the film’s soundtrack. The film actually starred Parton, Jane Fonda, and Lily Tomlin! What an all-star cast! She was nominated for an Oscar as well for a song featured in “Transamerica.” The film tells the story of a transgender woman on a road trip with her son.  Dinner With Dolly?  The song was about the 9 to 5 work days. It shouldn’t be surprising that Dolly Parton is a savvy entrepreneur but clearly doesn’t have to keep those hours. She has a number of investments in businesses in Eastern Tennessee, including her own Dollywood theme park! She also has a dinner theatre show called “Dolly Parton’s Dixie Stampede,” which is performed and popular all across the USA.  Not Riding High  You’d think if someone owns a theme park, they would probably like roller coasters. It turns out that Dolly Parton has never ridden a single ride at Dollywood! Why? She gets motion sickness. Her motion sickness was so severe that she even got sick on the school bus as a child.  A Talented Actress  Besides being a talented composer and songstress, Dolly Parton is also an accomplished actress. She first dabbled in acting on “The Port Wagoner Show,” and she didn’t stop there. She starred in her own show entitled “Dolly!” and got great reviews for her performance for “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.” She co-starred in this film with Burt Reynolds.  Signature Style  It turns out her role as Miss Mona in “The Best Little Whorehouse” wasn’t far-fetched. In the film, Dolly Parton runs the Chicken Ranch brothel. She has statted her signature look was inspired by a real-life woman of the night! She explained in an interview when she was a young girl she saw a lady with big yellow hair, bright red lipstick, and high heels. She decided that was exactly how she wanted to look.  Time for Love  Naturally, Dolly Parton’s life had more than just her career. She has had a very intriguing love life. She has been married to Cal Thomas Dean since 1966! That’s a long time! They got hitched in Ringgold, Georgia. Dolly changed her name to Dolly Parton Dean officially but still performs under her maiden name. Cal likes to stay out of the spotlight and has actually only seen her perform one time!  True Romance  Dolly Parton and Dean never spoke about it, and let fate decide when they would have children. She spoke very candidly about it and said she wasn’t destined to be the mother of two children, but rather a mother of everyone! She also has been open about praising Dean for his romantic gestures. The couple recently renewed their wedding vows and despite the rumors they are considered one of the strongest, longest lasting couples in showbiz!  A Family Affair  One very interesting fact is Dolly Parton is the godmother to Miley Cyrus! Now that Miley is all grown up, the pair has collaborated. They sang a rendition of Jolene together, and Parton acts as a source of support in her life. When the media has criticized Miley, Dolly has publically defended her.  Forever Young  Want to know how Dolly looks so great? It is due to a mixture of good genes but also plastic surgery! If something drops, she gets a little nip and tuck. She often jokes about it and we love that! She has stated in interviews while she might look fake on the outside, she’s real “where it counts.” She really believes every woman should do whatever they want as long as they feel and look good.  Not Herself?  Dolly Parton definitely has one of the most iconic looks in the music business. Her big blonde hair, big bosoms, coupled with her big personality is her trademark. As a joke, she actually competed in a Dolly Parton lookalike contest and lost. She said, “I didn’t even come close.” She also said many of the competitors were guys!    Just Friends  Because she is rarely seen with her husband, and due to her close relationship with her female childhood friend, Parton was accused of being secretly gay by the media. There are many pictures of her with Judy Ogle holding hands. The two have been best friends since she was in 3rd grade. While Dolly has said she loves Judy, they have nothing romantic going on between them.  Building Bridges  Despite their falling out many years prior, Dolly rushed to be at Porter Wagoner’s bedside when he was battling lung cancer. He passed away when he was 80 years old. Dolly was there to support him and also so they could say goodbye. She stated in an interview this experience was extremely difficult, and she prayed for him.  The Feud That Never Was  The media spun Dolly Parton as being jealous of Whitney Houston’s success with her own rendition of “I Will Always Love You.” This couldn’t be farther from the truth! The pair often spoke of how much they liked each other! Whitney personally thanked Dolly for allowing her to sing the song, and Parton said she was honored she wanted to cover it. How cute!  Book Days!  Growing up in poverty definitely led her to help other children in need when she was able to. She launched the Dollywood Foundation which allows children to get a new book every month from the time they are born until they reach kindergarten. She definitely is responsible for many bedtime stories!    Teaching Tolerance  Dolly Parton also holds an annual Gay Day charity event at Dollywood to support the LGBT community. She says, anyone, that judges in Dollywood is committing a sin. She stated, “I try to love everybody.” We love this and we love you, Dolly!  She Once Tried to Commit Suicide  While from the outside perspective, it might seem like she is happy and has it all. Like most of us, Dolly has had some hard times in her life and actually attempted suicide. While married, she and her husband decided to have an open relationship. When she broke up with her other man, it sent her on a downward spiral. She attempted to commit suicide, but fortunately, her Boston Terrier Popeye helped her realize she was making a huge mistake and she put down the gun.  President Parton  It is still a giant mystery how Dolly Parton voted in the last presidential election. There are some quotes that indicate she may have supported Hillary Clinton. She also has hinted she might run for herself and jokes that she has the hair for it! She’d definitely get our vote!  She’s More Relevant Than Ever  While Dolly is getting older, she is showing absolutely no signs of slowing down! Her most recent tour was one of her biggest ever in the USA. She also recently performed on The Voice with Miley Cyrus! It doesn’t stop there. She was also presented with the Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award at the Country Music Awards. Good things just keep on coming her way!  Rags to Riches  While Dolly grew up “dirt poor,” she obviously isn’t any longer! She is worth about $500 million! Wow! She earned a lot of money from royalties earned from Houston’s version of “I Will Always Love You.” She has real rags to riches story and we are so proud of her!  A Tattooed Lady?  There is speculation Dolly is covered with many secret tattoos. When you think about it, how often do you see Dolly wearing a super low cut or sleeveless shirts? The reality is she does have some ink! She has a little heart that has been spotted on her cleavage. Roseanne Barr stated Dolly also showed her an “awesome” pastel bow tattoo.    It’s All in the Hair  One part of Dolly Parton’s iconic image is her hair. She actually owns and wears a number of wings. Why? She first started experimenting with wigs at a young age and found it easier to achieve different shapes and styles. She claims she never leaves her home without a wig. Whatever works for you, Dolly! We think you look great!  Dolly the Sheep  One of the most infamous scientific experiments ever was named after her! Dolly, the sheep was named after Dolly Parton. If you didn’t know this, don’t feel bad. We didn’t know either! The experiment occurred in 1995 when scientists created a clone sleep from a somatic cell. The scientists named it after her because of her large bust. See, it wasn’t totally random!  The Lookalike Contest Fail  Dolly is known for taking a risk or two. On one Halloween night, she took part in a transgender lookalike contest on Santa Monica Boulevard and lost! I bet the audience went crazy when she revealed it was actually her competing!  Recreating Fond Memories  As we mentioned, Dolly was raised in a very low-income household with 12 siblings. Her childhood house in Tennessee didn’t have good plumbing or electricity. When she hit it big, she gave money to her brother Bobby to restore and improve the house. She wanted to keep it looking exactly the same, and only wanted to improve the plumbing and electricity. Interesting!  Barbie Influence  For a big portion of her life, Dolly wanted to be as pretty as Barbie. Part of this stems from the fact she comes from a poor family. Her entire life she has dreamed of being beautiful and even wrote “Backwards Barbie” about it. Some lyrics include, “I wanted to be pretty more than anything in the world, like Barbie. From rags to wishes in my dreams I could have it all. I’m just a backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair. Don’t be fooled by thinkin’ that the goods are not there.”  Body Art  Have you heard the rumors? For years the media has speculated that Dolly Parton is secretly covered in tattoos and that is the reason why she always has her arms covered. In a recent interview, she stated, “have a few little tattoos, but they were mostly done to cover scars because I’m so fair.” Will the rumor be laid to rest now? We will see!  Corn Song  Before Dolly even learned how to write, her mom helped her write songs! Even from a young age, the lyrics just came pouring out of Dolly. Her first song is called “Little Tiny Tasseltop.” Some lyrics from the song go: “Little tiny tasseltop, I love you an awful lot. Corn silk hair and big brown eyes, How you make me smile.”  5,000 Songs  To this day, guess how many songs Dolly has written? The answer: more than 5,000 songs! Not all of them have been released, but Dolly tries to write a new song every two or three days. How amazing!  Same-Same  Dolly Parton’s biggest hits? Easily her most popular songs are “Jolene” and “I Will Always Love You.” Did you know she penned both songs on the same night back in 1973? Pretty crazy, right?  Islands in the Stream  When Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers released their song, “Islands In The Stream,” it didn’t take long for it to soar to the top of the charts. It quickly rose to become the #1 duet of all time on the CMT 100 greatest country duets. Did you know the Bee Gees actually wrote the song?  Nothing But A Rumor  Billy Ray Cyrus credits Dolly Parton for kick-starting his career. After he released his first album, Dolly asked him to open for her in a few concerts. Once he started to open for her, his career really took off! The media speculated the two were more than just friends. When Cyrus began to apologize to Dolly for all the rumors, Dolly replied, “Honey, that sh*t sells records!”  Not Far Off  Many people think Dolly and her sister Stella look a lot alike. Do you agree? We do! Stella is actually also a singer who recently released a new album entitled, “Mountain Songbird.” Dolly inspired the album.  Huge Fan  In 1998, Drew Barrymore spoke about Dolly’s film: “Home Fries” before it was released. Barrymore’s character was a huge fan of Dolly Parton and told her that some of her songs would appear in the film. When the film was released, it wasn’t as Dolly centered as initially thought. There were few Dolly Parton references, but the film did include some posters and pictures of her.  Having A Laugh  Dolly is well known for her great sense of humor. It seems like she is always making people laugh! For example, she said, “I’m not offended by all the dumb blonde jokes because I know I’m not dumb… and I also know that I’m not blonde.” She also said, “I was the first woman to burn my bra – it took the fire department four days to put it out.” Oh, my.  Baaaaaaaa  Back in 1995, the first mammal was cloned successfully. Why should we care? Well, they named it after Dolly! Ian Wilmut, the man who cloned the sheep, explained, “Dolly is derived from a mammary gland cell and we couldn’t think of a more impressive pair of glands than Dolly Parton’s.”  Baaad Publicity  At first, when Dolly learned how the sheep got its name, she was happy! She stated, “she was called after me because she had big mammary glands. She gave me a lot of competition… but I always said there’s no such thing as baaad publicity.”  A Bridge Too  Having a sheep named after your bosom is nice, and it actually is not the only thing named after Dolly’s bust. Did you know the General W.K. Wilson Jr. Bridge or the Dolly Parton bridge is another example? It is located in Mobile, Alabama.  Nicknames-a-plenty  Dolly Parton has a ton of nicknames! Some include The Smoky Mountain Songbird, The Iron Butterfly, The Queen of Country, The Backwoods Barbie, The Queen of Nashville, The Book Lady, The Leading Lady of Country, and Aunt Granny. A pretty long list, right?    Thick And Thin Skin  When it comes to life, there is a lot we can learn from Dolly Parton. She has definitely made a point that having thick skin is absolutely critical to living a happy life. She believes being tough keeps bad vides out of your reach. She also very much believes in love!    Greatest Love  During a recent interview, Parton revealed, “My music is what took me everywhere I’ve been and everywhere I will go. It’s my greatest love. I can’t abandon it. I’ll always keep making records.” She truly is so passionate about what she does.  Big Spender  Dolly Parton has learned to care a little bit less when people criticize her fashion choices. Guess what? She loves how she looks. She is very confident, and this is one reason we love her so much.  Regrets  For a while now, Dolly has admitted she regrets not having children. In fact, during a recent interview with ABC news, she stated, “I used to think I should regret it. Early on, when my husband and I were dating, and then when we got married, we just assumed we would have kids. We weren’t doing anything to stop it. In fact, we thought maybe we would. We even had names if we did, but it didn’t turn out that way.”  Three’s Company  Did you know there was once a story about Dolly Parton, her BFF Jude and Sylvester Stallone? It is alleged the three of them got together and had a passionate threesome! Can you believe that? It is still unclear if this ever really happened or not.  Besties For Life  This wasn’t the only rumor about Dolly Parton and her best friend Judy Ogle. Many people are curious if they are friends or a little more! Some people even question if Dolly is bi-sexual! In an interview, Dolly stated, ” “Judy and I have been best friends since we were like in the third and fourth grade. I mean, I love her as much as I love anybody in the whole world, but we’re not romantically involved.”  Heart of the Matter  Everyone is curious about Dolly Parton’s love life and specifically her relationship with her husband, Carl. In an interview with the Daily Mail, Dolly stated, “I love to flirt, and I’ve never met a man I didn’t like. Men are my weakness. Short, fat, bald or skinny – I’ve had crushes on some very unusual men but Carl knows I’ll always come home and I’m not having sex with these people – I’m just flirtin’ and having fun.”  C-C-C-Changes  Dolly has experienced about 30 years of big boobs and it can be pretty painful! Dolly told Contact Music that she has been suffering and experiencing a ton of pain for the size of her boobs. She said in the interview, “My boobs are killing me – and I don’t know if I can stand the pain any longer. My boobs have been a trademark for me – but I’ve paid one hell of a price.”  Digits Please  Do you have any idea how tall Dolly Parton is? Turns out she is only 4 feet, 9 inches. You know what else? She is absolutely larger than life. Want to know her chest size? It is actually 40DD. She even has it insured! Yes, she has her chest insured! How much? A whopping $300,000 each.  That Famous Bust  Dolly is well known for not only her singing, appearance, songwriting abilities, but of course her chest size. And you know what? She isn’t afraid of it either. She once stated in an interview, “My boobs are fake, my hair’s fake but what is real is my voice and my heart.”  Busted  Kids sometimes pick up on some things that adults don’t. Parton explained in an interview, “Once I was going Christmas shopping. I did my makeup completely different with dark eyebrows, and wore a short black wig, and wore different clothes than I would normally wear.” She continued, “I said something, and this group of kids said, ‘You’re Dolly Parton in a black wig!'” Her voice was a dead giveaway in this case!  Disguises, Disguises  Surprisingly, there was a period in Dolly’s life where she felt the need to disguise herself when she went out in public. Just like most celebrities, sometimes they want some peace and quiet in public. Dolly attempted to conceal her identity with all sorts of things like wigs and makeup. Nothing seemed to work and she was totally recognizable!  The Imagination Library  Did you know in 1995 Dolly Parton started the book distribution company called “The Imagination Library.” She was actually inspired by her own father’s inability to read and write! How interesting! She started the drive in 1995, which does book donations to children under the age of 5. The goal is if they are introduced to books at a young age, they will fall in love with reading and keep reading!  Business Savvy  Dolly is also a very successful businesswoman. Pretty early on her career, she created Velvet Apple Music (BMI). This allows her to own the copyrights and publish all her own songs. In addition to that, she launched her own record label in 2007 called Dolly Records. When the label was first launched, she was the only person to appear on the label. She also did all the branding. Good on you, Dolly!  Crushing  Most people know this a little, but Johnny Cash had a huge influence on Dolly Parton. He told her to definitely pursue a career in music, and he was her first official crush. She stated when she saw him, “I was sitting in the audience and that’s when I first knew about sex appeal… he had this tick when he moved his shoulder… and it was still sexy. It still got to me.”  Dream Big  Dolly Parton knew from a young age that she was meant to be a star. When she was only 13 she recorded the song “Puppy Love.” When she first appeared on the Grand Ole Opry, she met Johnny Cash who told her to follow her instincts and pursue a career in music.  Stormzy Speaks  Stormzy is an English hip-hop star. When she reviewd Jolene on Twitter she stated, “And Jolene sounds like she’s the baddest b to ever walk this planet.”  First, I’m A Songwriter  Dolly Parton is a seriously talented songwriter! She has actually composed over 3,000 songs including “I Will Always Love You.” She is also one of few to be nominated for multiple Academy Awards, Grammys, Tony’s and Emmy Awards.",real
4716,"Some sad news in celebrity wedding land: Robert Pattinson and FKA twigs's upcoming nuptials have been canceled, according to an In Touch report. The tabloid says that Rob called off the summer wedding, quoting an insider who says ""it's been a long time coming"" and that the couple was ""fighting all the time."" The same source adds that ""Rob felt trapped"" and the wedding plans were not helping. And then there's this:  Furthermore, FKA twigs wasn't the girl Robert thought she was — and her true colors eventually came to light during their wedding planning. ""[She] isn't the girl for him. She's very jealous and he was sick of having to explain himself,"" the insider added. ""He's still young and just decided he wasn't ready to settle down.""  As with anything from In Touch, do take this with a grain of salt. For all you know, Rob and FKA are happily walking around a beach somewhere, laughing over this rumor, sipping wine, and looking beautiful. In fact, the folks at Gossip Cop are saying the report is false after checking in with a source ""close to the situation.""  Handsome Rob and FKA's engagement made headlines approximately one year ago when T-Pain accidentally revealed the news to Vulture. It was later confirmed by two sources to People and well, this is the ring, apparently:  Getty Images  Rob and FKA have not been spotted in public since last November's GO Campaign Gala in Beverly Hills but then again, their relationship has been generally private this whole time.

Today’s One Love Manchester benefit concert will not only continue, but will do so with greater purpose.”  The sold-out concert will include performances by Grande, Justin Bieber, Coldplay, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Pharrell Williams and more. Gates will open at 6 p.m. local time at the Manchester concert Sunday. The concert is happening nearly two weeks after a bomber killed 22 people at her Manchester Arena show on May 22.

Here's how to watch, stream Ariana Grande's Manchester concert in the U.S.  Grande said she was praying for London in a tweet shared Saturday night.  Event Commander, Chief Superintendent Stuart Ellison, said everyone coming to the concert will be searched at the event.  “I can understand some nervousness from members of the public perhaps but I can reassure them … they will see a heightened police presence.”  Ellison said armed police officers will be at the gates and inside the venue. John Fryer, major event transport planning lead with Transport for Greater Manchester, said those who plan to attend the concert should not drive. Free transportation is available. More information is available at tfgm.com.  Late Saturday, police said a van plowed into pedestrians on London Bridge and that assailants went on a stabbing rampage at nearby Borough Market.

Paris looked at the photographers as they headed to the tattoo parlor.  The two of them have occasionally hung out before. In 2016, Paris posted on Instagram photos of the two hanging out.

4255,"He says he decided to do like Rocky Balboa, to try to make the team “as a broken-down 40-year-old that didn’t have a lot of allies.” And he succeeded, finishing the season with 33 home runs. “I did that at 40 and 100 percent clean, and no one can take that away from me,” he says. “It told me everything about who I was.” When he retired, he agreed to stay on as an adviser to Yankee owner Hal Steinbrenner and as a mentor to younger players. “From where I came from, that honor is like hitting 800,” he says.  This, to Lopez, was a reveal. “The most impressive thing to me was how he did pick himself up and take that opportunity to make himself a better person,” she says. “The hardest times prove who you are. That’s what I love and admire the most about Alex. He doesn’t let anything beat him. He just comes back stronger.”  Each believes that if they had been single when they met, 12 years ago, the relationship wouldn’t have worked. “We had to grow and discover ourselves first,” she says. But it also works for another reason. As Goldsmith-Thomas says, “They weren’t afraid to dream, and they are still dreaming, both of them.”  The next night, Lopez is performing her smash show All I Have in Las Vegas. Onstage, she moves seamlessly from the best kind of sexy—with a sense of humor—to a festive Latin-inspired segment, to an utterly moving testimonial to her children, in which she sings Lee Ann Womack’s “I Hope You Dance.” She’s an incandescent performer, partly because, as Remini says, “there is nothing Jennifer does that she does half-assed. When she is in a project, she is in it, devouring it.”  “A-Rod’s in the house,” someone from the audience yells. She laughs. Yes, A-Rod is in the house. Although he’s seen the show many times, he’s still watching every detail. He nudges me, pointing out a middle-aged woman in a pink pantsuit dancing ecstatically to “Jenny from the Block.” Then he points out a gay couple in the front row practically swooning after one gets to touch Lopez’s feet. During a segment that’s all New York, with Lopez in a sequined baseball jersey, he nudges me again. “If you look closely, you’ll see what number she’s wearing on her jersey,” he says. It’s 13, his Yankee number.  He says, “We are very much twins.” She says, “I understand him in a way that I don’t think anyone else could.”  Earlier that day, she and Rodriguez were in Los Angeles at the premiere event for this season’s Shark Tank, in which Rodriguez will be the first Latino shark. At a panel where the sharks discussed the show, the investor and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban says, “A lot of us were pleasantly surprised that when Alex came in, he knew his stuff cold.”  During the red-carpet interviews, Lopez, who is impossibly glamorous in a floor-length tweed coat and aviator sunglasses, hangs at the back of the crowd. “Does it feel weird to be in the background?” I ask. “Noooo,” she says. “I like it. Because I’m out there enough. Some people, it wouldn’t work—they can’t stand not being the one in the spotlight. But not us.”  Back in Business  Their story is also a merger of business empires. Lopez, who back in 2002—way before everyone else was becoming an entrepreneur—launched her fragrance Glow by J.Lo, now has a big portfolio of business interests, which range from her production company to sprawling property holdings. Rodriguez seems to slot right into her world.  From a young age, he sought out mentors who could help him build a business that would one day replace his baseball income. During his suspension year, he took investing classes at Columbia and marketing classes at the University of Miami. Today, A-Rod Corp is an investment firm focused on a broad array of industries, including real estate, sports and wellness, media, and entertainment. “I don’t have your traditional formal education,” he says. “Mine comes through reading and passion and grit and collecting a lot of information from my mentors. I’ve never been afraid to say, ‘I don’t know. Can you explain that to me?’  That’s echoed by hedge-fund billionaire Marc Lasry, who has invested with Rodriguez for the last decade. “What’s interesting about Alex is that he’s a sponge,” Lasry says. “He really wants to learn.” Another mentor of sorts is Mary Callahan Erdoes, the C.E.O. of J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management, who met Rodriguez around the time that Lasry did. “You might be expecting something different,” she says. “But from the first day, he had his notebook out. He’s incredibly curious and serious. There’s no nonsense and no pomp and circumstance.” That’s true to this day, Erdoes says, whether he’s attending a JPMorgan-hosted conference on Brexit or a meeting with a hedge-fund manager. “He sits in the front of the room with his notebook out and his hand up, asking questions,” she says.",fake

1491,"Looks like there may be some trouble in paradise for Meghan Markle. Camilla Parker Bowles has allegedly warned the Suits star to stay away from Prince Harry but will she follow through?  According to Inquistr, Bowles was in Toronto last weekend and told Markle that she shouldn’t exchange vows with Harry. The actor has been dating the British prince since November 2016 and gotten along great with other members of the royal family. That might have changed after Markle agreed to meet Bowles on the occasion of Canada’s 150th anniversary.  Prince Harry has iftari with Muslim community in Singapore  “Camilla told Meghan that she didn’t like her relationship with Harry and that she should think twice before agreeing to his marriage proposal. Otherwise, Camilla was planning to make her life very tough,” a source revealed. “She’s long thought Meghan isn’t good enough for Harry and told her that she’s not welcome in the royal family.”  This isn’t the first sign of hostility from the Royals either. In January, rumours surfaced that Bowles was trying hard to ensure the youngsters’ romance didn’t last. Bowles doesn’t like Markle because she has been married in the past and brings a celebrity status to the royal family. Bowles was also thought to be the reason Prince William broke up with Kate Middleton in 2007.  Meanwhile, Daily Mail has released excerpts from Markle’s personal diary that show that the relationship is quite stressful. Between her acting career and Harry’s royal status in England, the two hardly have any time away from the media. That said, Markle’s diary closes with her thinking about a possible wedding, and it looks like 2018 might be the year. Of course, that will change if Bowles gets her way.  Harry confirmed his romance with Markle in November by issuing an official statement that slammed the media for hounding the latter. Although Harry is clearly protective of her privacy, the Markle family might be getting their own reality TV series called Meet the Markles in the near future.  Camilla Parker Bowles clawed and fought her way to acceptance into the British royal family and can’t understand how easy it is for one woman to be so warmly welcomed. Granted, this woman isn’t having an affair with a married future king or is central to placing the monarchy in a scandal. Instead, she’s an American who has caught the eye of a younger royal. Times have changed and tolerance for the unconventional exists more now than it did when Camilla was having an affair with Charles while he was married to the late Princess Diana.  The past lingers in the Duchess’ mind  A palace insider claims that Camilla Parker Bowles is resentful at how easy it is for #Meghan Markle to make her way into the firm.  She’s being warmly welcomed by the Windsors. The source sums it up by saying that Parker Bowles can’t believe “what an easy entree” Meghan is getting. It’s far easier for her to gain acceptance by everyone than it was for her. This is especially true of the queen, “who made her life hell” when she was dating Charles. Everything is fine now, but it was a rough ride for quite a while.  The source adds that “it’s as if a circle of Rottweilers” are sur Meghan because no one can say a bad word about her. Prince Harry is in love with Markle and wants support from his family. He’s getting it, according to the report.  The source continues that Camilla Parker Bowles intends to “obstruct” Meghan Markle’s path in any way that she can. It’s unfair in her eyes that this woman who isn’t even British is having it so easy.",fake
4557,"Things are changing quickly in Liam Payne and Cheryl Cole's life. They just welcomed their little bundle of joy into the world last week and have shared the amazing news with the world. Both Cheryl and Liam couldn't stop gushing about this new little human in their lives and they are super proud to call themselves parents. However, the former X-Factor judge did reveal that their son doesn't have a moniker yet.  Some reports are stating that Liam and Cheryl could be disagreeing on a name which is why one hasn't been picked out yet. Of course, this is all speculation and no one really knows why the baby doesn't have a name yet except the close family.  But, we did some digging and actually found old interviews where Liam and Cheryl talk about what they would name their future child. These interviews were done separately and before they even started dating. But, they each had completely different ideas when it came to the name.  Could this be a clue as to what's going on with the naming today? While there's no clear answer, it's interesting to think about.  Cheryl told GQ magazine, ""I love kids, I'm obsessed with babies. I know that's what I was put on the earth to do – to be a mother…Of course I've thought about baby names a million times. I like Alfie for a little boy.""  However, Liam told Hits Radio, ""I like the name Taylor. Taylor's pretty neutral for a boy or a girl. That's what I'm going to call my first child if I had children.""  Hmmm…there's no telling when or if they will reveal the baby name when they have decided but we have a feeling they will come to an agreement. And we're so excited when they do. However, multiple outlets are reporting that this photo could be the last fans see of the child. Apparently, Liam and Cheryl turned down lots of offers to publicly debut their baby and have vowed to keep his privacy and protect him from the public eye.  While this seems like something they would do, we're hoping they share bits and pieces of the baby. To be honest, we can't go through life wondering if he looks more like Liam or more like Cheryl! One thing is for sure, he's healthy and that's all that really matters. Here's to hoping picking out a name isn't actually putting stress on Cheryl and Liam's relationship.  Love J-14?

15169,"Placement of two or more otherwise discrete fictional characters, settings, or universes into the context of a single story  A crossover is the placement of two or more otherwise discrete fictional characters, settings, or universes into the context of a single story. They can arise from legal agreements between the relevant copyright holders, unauthorized efforts by fans or common corporate ownership.  Official and unofficial crossovers  Official  Crossovers often occur in an official capacity in order for the intellectual property rights holders to reap the financial reward of combining two or more popular, established properties. In other cases, the crossover can serve to introduce a new concept derivative of an older one.  Crossovers generally occur between properties owned by a single holder, but they can, more rarely, involve properties from different holders, provided that the inherent legal obstacles can be overcome. They may also involve using characters that have passed into the public domain with those concurrently under copyright protection.  A crossover story may try to explain its own reason for the crossover, such as characters being neighbors (notable examples being the casts from The Golden Girls and Empty Nest) or meeting via dimensional rift or similar phenomenon (a common explanation for science fiction properties that have different owners). Some crossovers are not explained at all. Others are absurd or simply impossible within the fictional setting, and have to be ignored by the series' respective continuities. Still, others intentionally make the relations between two or more fictional universes confusing, as with The Simpsons and Futurama, where each show is fiction in the other.  Unofficial  In contrast with legal crossovers, unofficial crossovers are created solely because of the artistic pleasure derived by its producers. Generally, unofficial crossovers take the form of fan-written fiction and fan art, but it is increasingly prevalent in amateur films and audio. Whereas official crossovers are frequently stymied by such concerns as copyright, royalties payments, quality of writing and ownership of the characters, unofficial crossovers are unfettered by such concerns, so long as property holders do not exercise their right to enjoin the distribution of such material.  A good example would be the unauthorised live action fan film Batman: Dead End, which brings together the properties of Batman, Alien and Predator in one setting.  Unofficial crossovers can also occur in a ""what-if"" scenario. Roger makes frequent cameo appearances in Family Guy, while Brian makes cameos on American Dad!. Roger, Rallo Tubbs, and Klaus Heissler were seen in the final Family Guy Star Wars spoof, ""It's A Trap!"", as an Imperial Officer, Nien Nunb, and Admiral Ackbar, respectively. Stewie also appears as an interactive hallucination of Booth on Bones when the agent has issues over possibly becoming a sperm donor, with David Boreanaz (who plays Booth) repaying the favor in ""Road to the North Pole"". An appearance by Elmo, from Sesame Street, was made, in a hallucination of Connie Ray's, on TV sitcom The Torkelsons. Fan fiction fusions between different science fiction movies and series are often created, such as Star Wars vs. Star Trek or Babylon 5 vs. Stargate. M.U.G.E.N. is a fighting game engine that features many fan-created and fictional characters and stages from various television series, movies, as well as other video games.  Comics  Speed Comics number 32, Artwork by Comic book crossovers may be traced back to the Golden Age , where characters frequently teamed up on the cover (though far more rarely on the inside).number 32, Artwork by Alex Schomburg  Crossovers of multiple characters, owned by one company or published by one publisher, have been used to set an established continuity, where characters can frequently meet within one setting. This is especially true of comic book publishers, as different characters in various Marvel, DC, or Valiant comic books frequently interact with one another since they live in a ""shared universe"". For example, in the Marvel Comics universe, Spider-Man has frequent dealings with another Marvel hero, Daredevil, just as in the DC Comics Universe, the Flash and Green Lantern often collaborate. In comic book terminology, these ""guest star"" roles are common enough that they are generally not considered crossovers; rather, this short-term collaboration to fight crime is called a team-up. A crossover in comic book terms only occurs when a story spans more than one title.[citation needed] This has led to ""crossover events"", in which major occurrences are shown as affecting most or all of the stories in the shared universe.  The earliest such crossover event was Gardner Fox's Zatanna's Search, which took place in Hawkman #4 (October/November 1964), Detective Comics #336 (February 1965), The Atom #19 (June/July 1965), Green Lantern #42 (January 1966), Detective Comics #355 (September 1966), and Justice League of America #51 (February 1967). This story dealt with Zatanna attempting to reconnect with her father, Zatara, and seeking the aid of Hawkman, Batman, Robin, the Atom, Green Lantern, and the Elongated Man along the way.  The first major crossover event was spearheaded by the Marvel Editor-in-Chief at the time, Jim Shooter. As a way to further toy sales he devised the Secret Wars crossover, which brought all the major Marvel heroes into a 12-issue miniseries to battle a common threat. After the threat was dealt with, they all returned to their regular titles. Secret Wars was hailed as both a critical and commercial success, largely because the events of the crossover had lasting effects on the characters (such as the introduction of Spider-Man's black suit which would later become the villain Venom). Jim Shooter later perfected his crossover technique at Valiant Comics with the Unity event. Unity brought all the Valiant characters together to defeat Mothergod, but was told within the existing Valiant Comics titles (and two bookend special issues). Readers were not obliged to buy all 18 chapters as the story was coherent when reading just one title, but far more layered when all were read. Like Secret Wars, the Unity crossover had lasting effects on the Valiant universe; most notably the introduction of Turok, the birth of Magnus, Robot Fighter and the death of a major Valiant hero.  Dark Horse Comics's Aliens Versus Predator comic book franchise was a success that continued into many video games, two movies and even an Aliens Versus Predator Versus The Terminator comic.  The comic crossovers from Raj Comics are very famous in India, in which the super heroes meet to fight a common enemy. Many of these crossovers have occurred between Nagraj and Super Commando Dhruva. In Kohram, all the heroes in Raj Universe meet to finish Haru, an extremely powerful enemy.  Webcomics creators sometimes produce crossovers; one of the first was a two-week sequence between Christopher Baldwin's Bruno and Peter Zale's Helen, Sweetheart of the Internet in 1998.[1]  In 2013, Archie Comics released a 12-part crossover of Capcom character Mega Man and Sega character Sonic the Hedgehog called ""Worlds Collide"". Taking place in issues of the Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Universe, and Mega Man comic series from Archie, the crossover involved Dr. Eggman and Dr. Wily forming an alliance to take over both their universes and destroy their respective nemeses. Sonic and Mega Man were briefly tricked into fighting each other, but later joined forces and teamed up with other heroes to battle the doctors' forces, which included virtually every Robot Master introduced in the Mega Man games. The popularity of this crossover and the books involved led to a second crossover in 2015 entitled ""Worlds Unite"", which not only reunited Sonic and Mega Man, but also featured comics-exclusive characters from both of their books, the Mega Man X and Sonic Boom spinoff franchises and various other SEGA and Capcom franchises. This crossover was enabled by the conclusion of the first crossover, which saw a reboot to the Sonic books as their universe was drastically rewritten. Aftereffects of this included the Genesis Portals, gateways connecting worlds that would be exploited by Mega Man X villain Sigma and his minions, forcing a reunion between Sonic and Mega Man and an alliance between heroes of the various franchises involved. ""Worlds Unite"" spans not only the three series featured in the first crossover, but also includes the Sonic Boom comic series, which entered publication between the two crossovers.  There are also intercompany crossovers, where characters owned by two different companies meet, such as those from DC and Marvel.  Animation  Cartoon crossovers are not uncommon, and most of them – like comics or live-action TV shows – will often feature characters owned by the same company or network. One example is Cartoon Network's The Grim Adventures of the Kids Next Door. It features five crossovers – Ed, Edd n Eddy, Codename: Kids Next Door, The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, a reference to The Powerpuff Girls and a quote from Scooby-Doo, which are all licensed Cartoon Network series. The cast of Ben 10: Ultimate Alien and Generator Rex team up in Ben 10/Generator Rex: Heroes United. Similarly, characters from Uncle Grandpa and Steven Universe appeared in a crossover episode ""Say Uncle"". The same occurred with The Powerpuff Girls and Teen Titans Go! in an episode called ""TTG v PPG"". OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes did a crossover episode called ""Crossover Nexus"" to celebrate 25 years of Cartoon Network where the lead character joined forces with Ben 10, Garnet from Steven Universe and Raven from Teen Titans. Most of the last episodes of the Lilo & Stitch: The Series (a spinoff of the film Lilo & Stitch) had crossovers with various other Disney cartoons, including The Proud Family, Kim Possible, Recess, and American Dragon Jake Long. The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour trilogy is another example, in which Jimmy Neutron and Timmy Turner switch universes. The Disney TV series Hercules, based on the 1997 film of the same name, had an episode titled ""Hercules and the Arabian Night"" that had a crossover between the characters of the TV series and film and with the characters of the Disney film Aladdin, in which Hades and Jafar each try to get rid of each other's enemies (Hades would try to defeat Aladdin while Jafar would try to defeat Hercules). Another crossover is Rugrats Go Wild in which the Rugrats are stranded on an island where The Wild Thornberrys were at the time. In Dexter's Laboratory ""Dial M for Monkey"" ""Huntor"" who tries to hunt Monkey is himself hunted; ""Huntor"" later makes a cameo crossover in Samurai Jack's ""Jack vs Mad Jack."" During the 1970s and 1980s, crossovers were particularly common among the Hanna-Barbera properties. Some of the earliest examples happened on The New Scooby-Doo Movies, which featured appearances by characters from Harlem Globetrotters, Josie and the Pussycats, Jeannie, Speed Buggy, Batman and Robin, and The Addams Family. Later, the Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10 set of movies involved several crossovers, including such combinations as The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones. This was taken to an extreme in the 1977–79 series Laff-A-Lympics, which was essentially a gathering of the Hanna-Barbera characters for a regular series.  Crossovers are not necessarily composed of characters under common ownership. Two of the most notable cartoon crossovers consisted of characters from different companies. Disney's movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit had characters from various companies, most notably Disney and Warner Bros. Daffy Duck and Donald Duck made a simultaneous appearance in one scene, in which the two of them exchanged blows during a piano duet. Later in the movie, Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny were shown parachuting together (to keep things from getting too iffy legally, Mickey and Bugs' lines were written so that each of them said exactly the same number of words in the movie).[citation needed] The film also includes cameos of characters from MGM. The end of the movie features all the cartoons from all of the animation companies joining together in song, to be concluded by Porky Pig stuttering his famous ""That's All, Folks!"" line as Tinker Bell ends the scene with a magical fade-out.  On February 27, 1998, Fox Kids show, Power Rangers in Space and Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation, had their crossover with the episode ""Shell Shocked"".  On October 4, 1997, The 2 Kids WB shows, Superman: The Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures, had their first crossover with the TV movie World's Finest, which was also released on DVD.  Another cartoon crossover would occur in 1990, Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue. This cartoon featured popular characters from children's Saturday morning cartoons, banding together to promote an anti-drug message. ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC aired this half-hour special one Saturday morning with characters from all their networks, including Huey, Dewey, and Louie (from Disney's DuckTales), Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Slimer (from The Real Ghostbusters and Extreme Ghostbusters), Michelangelo (from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Alvin and the Chipmunks, The Smurfs, ALF (from his short-lived cartoon spinoff), Garfield, and the trio of Baby Kermit, Baby Piggy, and Baby Gonzo (from Jim Henson's Muppet Babies). Animation companies granted unlimited, royalty-free use of their cartoon characters for this project, a feat that has been unequalled before or since then. This cartoon was also introduced by then-President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush, and would be distributed to schools and video stores free of charge nationwide.  Manga artist Leiji Matsumoto has been known to cross over the characters of his various stories and characters such as Captain Harlock, Galaxy Express 999, and Queen Millennia, all of which were originally written as separate, self-contained stories. In the Maetel Legend, Queen Promethium is revealed to be having been Yukino Yaoi, the protagonist from Queen Millennia. Matsumoto has also created various crossovers with Space Battleship Yamato, an anime on which he served as director, although the rights to Yamato are actually owned by Yoshinobu Nishizaki.  The adult parody-oriented series Drawn Together features many crossovers; while some are regular cameos, such as Peter and Lois Griffin from Family Guy, others involve a personality twist, such as the homicidal version of Bambi from the eponymous film or the gay version of Elmer Fudd from the Looney Tunes franchise.  The Disney/Marvel crossover Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel features the Marvel heroes Spider-Man, Iron Man, the Hulk, and Thor, the Marvel villains Whiplash, MODOK, Red Skull, and Venom, and characters from Phineas and Ferb, where the storyline involves Phineas and Ferb trying to restore power to the Marvel heroes, whose powers were taken away by Doofenshmirtz.  During its 26th season, The Simpsons has crossovers with Family Guy and Futurama. In the hour-long Family Guy season 13 premiere ""The Simpsons Guy"", the Griffins meet the Simpson family,[2] who meet the Planet Express crew in the Simpsons episode ""Simpsorama"".[3]  In the Disney series House of Mouse, Mickey Mouse and friends host a nightclub featuring cameos by other Disney characters.  Webtoons (animated shows from the internet) can also have crossovers with different webtoons, franchises, YouTubers and more. Some examples are when Kate from TomSka's Crash Zoom series makes an appearance in Eddsworld as a trick or treater who possesses Matt and Edd in the episode, ""Trick or Threat"". In addition to this a couple of characters from Eddsworld make appearances in some Crash Zoom episodes such as ""Orcs and Dorks"". Another example is Death Battle which is a show where two hosts (Wiz and Boomstick) put two characters from different franchises together to battle each other. These characters range from television, movie, video game, or comic franchises. Shows like One Minute Melee, Cartoon Fight Club, and Death Battle Exhibitions (the spinoff series) have a similar format to Death Battle.  By Disney, Hasbro and Universal, the crossover served as the films The Nature Vacations of Pokémon, Animals, Friendship Ponies and Dinosaurs and The Nature Vacations of Fantastic World of the Adventure, which were called The Nature Vacations Movie, includes Jacob Griffith the protagonist among with characters of My Little Pony, such as Twilight Sparkle, Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, especially all of those several characters around the world.  The Netflix original series Harvey Girls Forever is a crossover of the comics Little Audrey, Little Dot and Little Lotta, although later episodes in the third and fourth season are crossovers of Richie Rich and Casper the Friendly Ghost.  Anime and Manga  Anime has also participated in many crossover events featuring characters or shows from the same company or network. One of the biggest projects down would be Dream 9 Toriko x One Piece x Dragon Ball Z Super Special Collaboration as if includes three Shonen Jump franchises, being Dragon Ball Z, One Piece, and Toriko, crossed over into an hour long special Like most crossovers, this special is filler, a fan-service episode that follows the common plot line in most crossovers. In the first half of the special, characters from the three franchises meet-up and fight. In the second half, they team up to battle a stronger foe. What makes this crossover unique is when the characters from all three shows split into groups, where the members all share the same cliched character archetypes, such the main characters Goku, Luffy, and Toriko falling into the dumb, good natured, strong character archetype.[4]  Carnival Phantasm is also an OVA comedy series based off of a Type-Moon gag manga called Take-Moon. Created to celebrate the company's 10th anniversary, the anime consists of several funny and unusual scenarios involving various characters from the Type-Moon franchises.[5] Some examples include characters from Fate/stay night and Tsukihime.  The Dragon Ball franchise is one of the most popular manga and anime in the world, and has its fair share of crossovers as well. The creator of the franchise, Akira Toriyama, has used another character from a different manga series he created, Jaco from Jaco the Galactic Policeman as a reoccurring character in Dragon Ball Super. He comes to Earth to warn the characters about the return of Frieza and is later seen in the disputes involving Beerus and Champa. [6]  Cyborg 009 VS Devilman is a three part anime OVA that crosses over the Cyborg 009 and Devilman series. It originally aired on 17 October, 2015 [7] and then was released on 11 November 2015 [8] Netflix currently owns the rights to this title.  Other anime- or manga-based crossovers include: Digimon and Digimon Fusion, Fairy Tail x Rave Master, Isekai Quartet, It's a Rumic World: 50th Anniversary Weekly Shonen Sunday, Kamen Rider Fourze x Crayon Shin-chan, Lupin III vs. Detective Conan: the Movie, Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Undersea Super Train: Marine Express, and Yu-Gi-Oh!: Bonds Beyond Time.  Film  King Kong vs. Godzilla showing the title characters fighting each other. Battle sequence inshowing the title characters fighting each other.  The first film crossover in a series of Universal Studios monster films was Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, in 1943. In 2003, Freddy vs. Jason was released by New Line Cinema. In 2004, 20th Century Fox released Alien vs. Predator along with the sequel Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem in 2007. One year later, both Dollman vs. Demonic Toys and Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys were released by 20th Century Fox and Terry Kelley Studios. In 2015, Sony released Lake Placid vs. Anaconda.  After the comics publishing house Marvel Comics ventured into movie production, they set off to produce solitary films with popular superheroes from the Avengers team, with characters from upcoming films making cameo appearances in films starring another superhero, while it all lead to the crossover movie The Avengers (2012). The same process was repeated for Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019) and all the movies together form the crossover film series referred to as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Inspired by Marvel's success, Warner Bros., who hold movie rights for DC Comics' heroes, announced the production of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and further plans to develop the cinematic DC Extended Universe, while Paramount Pictures and Allspark Pictures announced plans to create a cinematic universe on the Transformers film series.  There have been numerous crossovers in Japanese cinema. The boom of kaiju films saw a lot of crossovers produced at Toho Studios, with some of the monsters forming teams in numerous movies, much like the Marvel movie franchise. Godzilla, Mothra and Rodan (Radon) each first appeared in standalone films before being set against each other or even teaming up against stronger enemies. Their first encounter was in 1964, first in Mothra vs. Godzilla and a few months later of all three in Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster. In 1962 Toho released King Kong vs. Godzilla. The long running Zatoichi series sees Shintaro Katsu's blind master swordsman face off with Toshiro Mifune in his iconic role in Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo (1970) and also features a unique cross-Asian project Zatoichi and the One-Armed Swordsman (1971). This coproduction sees Jimmy Wang reprise his famous part of the One-Armed Swordsman while featuring two different endings for both the Japanese and Hong Kong audiences.  Games  Crossovers in video games occur when otherwise separated fictional characters, stories, settings, universes, or media in a video game meet and interact with each other. These can range from a character simply appearing as a playable character or boss in the game, as a special guest character, or a major crossover where two or more franchises encounter.  Konami made the first crossover video game featuring Simon Belmont from Castlevania, Universal Picture's King Kong and Mikey from the Warner Bros. movie The Goonies in Konami Wai Wai World for the Famicom in 1988. The King of Fighters, Marvel vs. Capcom, and many other franchises from third-party developers such as Capcom and SNK bring these licenses together.  The 2.5D fighting game series Super Smash Bros. brings various Nintendo characters together and allow players to fight against each other as these characters in arenas. The third game in the series, Super Smash Bros. Brawl introduced two third-party characters with the inclusion of Solid Snake and Sonic the Hedgehog, of Konami's Metal Gear series and Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series respectively. The fourth installments, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, feature characters from the third-party franchises of Capcom's Mega Man (Mega Man) and Street Fighter (Ryu), Sega's Bayonetta (Bayonetta), Bandai Namco's Pac-Man (Pac-Man), and Square Enix's Final Fantasy (Cloud Strife), in addition to other Nintendo characters from the company's different universes. The fifth installment, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate also introduced Simon and Richter Belmont from Konami's Castlevania series, Ken Masters from Capcom's Street Fighter series, Joker from Persona 5, the Hero from the Dragon Quest series, Banjo-Kazooie from the Banjo-Kazooie series and Terry Bogard from the Fatal Fury series in addition to bringing back all of the playable characters from the previous entries in the series.  The Namco-developed Soul series features characters from a variety of other franchises including Link from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series, Heihachi Mishima from Tekken, Todd McFarlane's Spawn, Darth Vader, Yoda, and Starkiller from Star Wars, Lloyd Irving from Tales of Symphonia, Ubisoft Montreal's Ezio Auditore from the Assassin's Creed series, Geralt of Rivia from Andrzej Sapkowski's The Witcher, and YoRHa No. 2 Type B from PlatinumGames' Nier: Automata.  Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games, released in Japan two months before Super Smash Bros. Brawl, was the first time that Mario and Sonic (as well as their associated characters) appeared in a game together.  The Kingdom Hearts series of role-playing games developed by Square Enix features a number of characters from Disney films, Final Fantasy, and The World Ends With You.  Starting with Mortal Kombat, video game developer NetherRealm Studios has guest characters ranging from Mortal Kombat veterans Scorpion, Sub-Zero and Raiden to Freddy Krueger from A Nightmare on Elm Street, Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Xenomorph from Alien, The Predator from Predator, the T-800 from Terminator, Kratos from God of War, The Joker from Batman, all four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Todd McFarlane's Spawn and Mike Mignola's Hellboy.  Super Robot Wars are turn-based strategy games featuring a variety of Japanese mecha series from many generations, such as Mazinger Z, Gundam, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and GaoGaiGar.  Warriors Orochi is the game that features the casts of both the Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors series. The third installment of this series included a number of playable characters from other Koei Tecmo properties, such as Ninja Gaiden, Dead or Alive, Zill O'll, and Sophitia Alexandra from Bandai Namco's Soul series. Warriors All-Stars similarly crossed-over a number of characters from Koei Tecmo series.  More recently, there has been a collaboration between Capcom and Namco, which results in Street Fighter X Tekken and the upcoming Tekken X Street Fighter.  Heroes of the Storm is an example of the major crossover video game, which is developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. This hero brawler brings various Blizzard's characters together as playable heroes, as well as different battlegrounds based on Warcraft, Diablo, StarCraft, and Overwatch universes.  Perhaps one of the most notable video game crossovers is Lego Dimensions, which makes use of over 30 different franchises, including DC Comics, Doctor Who, The Lego Movie, The Lord of the Rings, Sonic the Hedgehog, and more.  A large number of video game characters make cameo appearances in the Disney computer-animated film Wreck-It Ralph and its sequel.  Literature  In literature, some authors also engage in crossovers by including characters from different novels they have written in one. Kim Newman frequently uses this device, as does Stephen King. The works of James Branch Cabell, J.D. Salinger, William Faulkner, Margaret Laurence, Thomas Pynchon, Kurt Vonnegut, Mordecai Richler, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Robert Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov also cross over with each other, linking different characters and settings together over a number of different works. Author Rick Riordan publishes multiple book series featuring gods of ancient civilizations in the modern day, which have had two crossovers and three references to other series. The first popular crossover in literature was the 1885 Mark Twain novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which had an important guest appearance by Tom Sawyer. Similarly, Lady Glencora Palliser from the Pallisers series of Anthony Trollope appears towards the end of Miss Mackenzie, a novel published between the first and second Palliser novels in 1865, a character first introduced in the novel, Can You Forgive Her? (1864).  Science Fiction writer Poul Anderson allowed fellow writer A. Bertram Chandler to ""borrow"" Anderson's space-faring character Dominic Flandry and let Flandry meet with Chandler's John Grimes in a common adventure (the two fail to like each other). Alex Scarrow featured the characters Cato and Macro from his brother Simon's Eagles of the Empire series in one book of the TimeRiders series: Gates of Rome (2012), serving as supporting characters when the three protagonists travel back in time to Ancient Rome.  Brazilian writer Monteiro Lobato also created solid and imaginative crossovers, using elements and characters from Brazilian folklore such as the Cuca and Saci, from Greek mythology, from the Arabian Nights, from fairy tales such as Grimm's ""Snow White"", Western literature such as Peter Pan, cartoons such as Popeye and Felix the Cat, and Western films.  Public domain  It is also common for authors to 'crossover' characters who have passed into the public domain, and thus do not require copyright or royalty payments for their use in other works. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill is another example of this, as all of the main characters and most of the secondary / background characters are fictional characters whose copyright has expired, and all are characters of different authors and creators brought together within one massive extended universe. Many of the works of Philip José Farmer's Wold Newton family sequences (which has also been explored and developed by other authors) also utilize and interweave numerous otherwise unrelated fictional characters into a rich family history by speculating familial connections between them (such as a blood-relationship between Sherlock Holmes and Tarzan). Roger Zelazny's novel A Night in the Lonesome October combines Sherlock Holmes, Doctor Frankenstein, Jack the Ripper, and the Cthulhu Mythos, although he never specifically identifies them as such (""The Count"", ""The Good Doctor"", ""Jack"", etc.).  Occasionally, authors will include into crossovers classic fictional characters whose copyright is still held by the original authors (or at least their estates), but who are nevertheless considered iconic or 'mythic' enough to be recognised from a few character traits or descriptions without being directly named (thus not requiring royalties payments to be made to the copyright holder). A prominent example occurs within The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume One, wherein a character who is clearly intended in appearance and description by other characters to be Dr. Fu Manchu appears as a significant villain; however, as this character was not in the public domain at the time of writing and the rights still held by the estate of his creator Sax Rohmer, he is not directly named as such in the work and is only referred to as 'the Devil Doctor'. Something similar occurs in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier, wherein a character named ""Jimmy"" is clearly intended to be Ian Fleming's character James Bond, though here he is satirized as being an inept and unfavorable antagonist, likely to parody Sean Connery's appearance in the 2003 film adaptation. Another example in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is when a character is named to be the Anti-Christ, yet, despite never being named, is shown to be an evil Harry Potter.  The TV show Once Upon a Time is set in a world in which all fairy tales coexist, including Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood, and even Alice in Wonderland. (As a production of The Walt Disney Company, copyrighted elements from that company's productions have appeared in Once Upon a Time.) The Shrek film series is built on the same concept, and even includes references to then-copyrighted elements like Peter Pan (often in the form of satire).  Television series  Between established shows  Crossovers involving principals can also occur when the characters have no prior relationship, but are related by time period, locale or profession. The Law and Order series, for example, afford a commonality of setting and profession which lends itself to crossovers, both within the franchise and in a wider universe. Law & Order: SVU has crossed over several times with Chicago P.D. and Chicago Fire, as well as sharing a common character with Homicide: Life on the Street. NCIS has crossed over with NCIS: Los Angeles, NCIS: New Orleans and JAG, while NCIS: Los Angeles has crossed over with both Scorpion and Hawaii Five-0. Following the cancellation of the ABC soap opera One Life to Live and its high rated finale, several characters crossed over into the network's remaining soap opera General Hospital, remaining in the same timeline as their former show.  The CSI franchise is another common example of the crossover phenomena, with the original series crossing over with CSI: Miami, CSI: Cyber, CSI: NY and Without a Trace. CSI: NY crossed over with fellow CBS series Cold Case, and Ted Danson appeared as a regular on both CSI and Cyber. Similarly, Family Guy has crossed over with The Simpsons, while The Simpsons has crossed over with Futurama. The X-Files has in turn crossed over with Millennium, Homicide: Life on the Street, The Lone Gunmen and Cops. A proposed crossover with The West Wing was planned, but was never produced.  The Beverly Hillbillies, Green Acres, and Petticoat Junction shared a common universe, so crossovers were not uncommon. Doctor Who and Torchwood both take place in the same universe, and have had multiple crossovers, including Torchwood characters appearing in ""The Stolen Earth"" and ""Journey's End"". Torchwood's first series finale ends with the materialisation sound of the TARDIS, which is seen in Doctor Who's series 3 episode ""Utopia"".  Between related shows  Though most common on shows of the same production company (see, for example, ""Hurricane Saturday""), crossovers have also occurred because shows share the same distributor or television network. A notable example of this kind of link is that between Murder, She Wrote and Magnum, P.I. These shows were made by different companies, but owned by Universal Studios and broadcast on CBS. Another case is that of Mad About You and Friends, which share the character of Ursula Buffay. Neither show shares any production or distribution commonality, but rather an actress (Lisa Kudrow), a setting (New York City) and a schedule (Friends initially followed Mad About You on NBC's Thursday night schedule).  Mad About You and Friends share another type of ""network crossover"". On rare occasions, networks have chosen to theme an entire night's programming around a crossover ""event"". In one case, a New York City blackout caused by Paul Reiser's character on Mad About You was experienced by the characters on Friends and Madman of the People.[9] Such ""event nights"" can also be linked by a single character's quest across multiple shows on the same evening. ABC attempted this kind of ""event night"" crossover with its Friday night programming during the 1997 season. There, they proposed that the title character of Sabrina the Teenage Witch should chase her cat, Salem, through Boy Meets World, You Wish and Teen Angel because it had run away with a ""time ball"" that was displacing each show through time.[10]  ABC also attempted a ""crossover"" when four of its sitcoms (Grace Under Fire, Ellen, The Drew Carey Show and Coach) all went to Las Vegas during the 1996–1997 season.  Dan Schneider used his show Zoey 101 to promote his new show iCarly by making characters from Zoey 101 go to ICarly.com or use the song the iCarly theme song as a ringtone. A Henry Danger comic book and Gibby's wax head is seen in the Game Shakers episode ""Lost Jacket, Falling Pigeons"", the subway station's lost and found.  The CW's superhero franchise Arrowverse has held annual crossover events since 2014.[11]  Narrative rationales  On other occasions, crossovers between established shows can occur without a network or production commonality, but simply because there is some narrative rationale for the crossover. The appearance of detective John Munch (from NBC's Homicide: Life on the Street) on Fox's The X-Files happened merely because the episode revolved around a crime scene in Baltimore, a logical place for characters on The X-Files to have encountered Munch. Munch would also appear on the TV series Law & Order on NBC in which it had one episode which began on that series in New York City and concluded in Baltimore on Homicide: Life on the Street. Later, when Homicide went off the air in 1999, Detective Munch ends up leaving Baltimore to move to New York, and becoming a permanent character (as New York City Detective Munch) on NBC's Law & Order: Special Victims Unit until October 2013.  A two-part crossover episode between CSI: Crime Scene Investigation with Without a Trace aired on November 8, 2007. The first hour was on CSI and the second hour was on Without a Trace.[12] While both series are on the same network in the United States, spreading two parts of a story across two different shows can cause problems in international markets where they have been separately sold to different broadcasters. For example, in the United Kingdom, Without a Trace was shown on Channel 4 and CSI on Channel 5, meaning the two companies had to come to a special agreement to show both episodes.[13] Another CSI crossover occurred in 2009 when Raymond Langston from CSI: Crime Scene Investigation appeared both in CSI: Miami[14] and CSI: NY,[15] traveling to Miami and New York to track a human trafficking and organ harvesting ring. ER had a crossover with Third Watch which corresponded with a peak in viewership for the latter show, with 17.2 million viewers.[16]  In 2013, the Canadian crime drama series Republic of Doyle and Murdoch Mysteries produced a crossover,[17] which was complicated by the shows' incompatible historical settings; Murdoch Mysteries is a historical series set in the 1890s, while Republic of Doyle is set in the present day. The problem was solved by having the actors cross over as relatives of their primary characters; Allan Hawco appeared on the November 25, 2013 episode of Murdoch Mysteries as Jacob Doyle, a 19th-century ancestor of his regular character Jake Doyle, while Yannick Bisson appeared on a January 2014 episode of Republic of Doyle as Bill Murdoch, a 21st-century descendant of his regular character William Murdoch.[17]  In children's television  Disney Channel's Suite Life franchise has featured three crossovers: In 2006, That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana featured characters from Hannah Montana and That's So Raven taking a vacation at the Tipton Hotel (the main setting of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody); Hannah Montana/Miley Stewart (Miley Cyrus) also eats cake off Zack; this recurs when she eats cake off of Cody during the 2009 crossover Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana, in which characters from Wizards of Waverly Place and Hannah Montana come on aboard the S.S. Tipton (though the characters from Wizards of Waverly Place and Hannah Montana do not interact). The New Year's special Austin & Jessie & Ally All Star New Year, which aired in 2013, features characters from Austin & Ally and Jessie. In 2015 a crossover between two Disney XD shows Lab Rats: Bionic Island and Mighty Med crossed over in the special ""Lab Rats vs. Mighty Med"".  Another type of crossover involves characters from an off-the-air series resurfacing in a newer series. This occurred in a 2010 episode of the Nickelodeon sitcom iCarly; the episode ""iStart a Fan War"" featured recurring characters from two Nickelodeon series: Drake & Josh characters Eric Blonowitz, Craig Ramirez, Gavin Mitchell, and Zoey 101 character Stacey Dillsen. A crossover between Victorious and Drake & Josh also occurred, with Helen DuBois, portrayed by Yvette Nicole Brown making an appearance. An episode titled ""iParty with Victorious"" was a crossover between iCarly and Victorious. This means all 4 shows exist in the same universe. However, in Who Did It to Trina, Tori referred to Drake and Josh as a TV show, making it seem as if the previous appearance was an actor of a character from a show within a show. Also in multiple episodes from iCarly and Sam & Cat (a crossover/spin-off of iCarly and Victorious) one can see Drake and Josh and Zoey 101 in TV guides, when the characters are watching TV. Carly and Spencer were heard watching it in the iCarly episode iGet Pranky and Carly is seen looking at it briefly in iToe Fat Cakes and you can see the character Megan from Drake and Josh (also portrayed by Miranda Cosgrove) and Sam is seen changing the channel to it in #FavoriteShow an episode from Sam & Cat, making the universe between each of the shows confusing. However, these were probably all non-canonical references.  In 2014, The Thundermans and The Haunted Hathaways did a crossover, called ""The Haunted Thundermans"". In 2016, Henry Danger and The Thundermans did a crossover, called ""Danger & Thunder"". In 2017, Henry Danger and Game Shakers did a crossover, called ""Danger Games"", which was then followed by a crossover episode, called ""Babe Loves Danger"", that aired in 2018. In 2017, Game Shakers did a crossover with iCarly, called ""Game Shippers"".  The main characters of Aaahh!!! Real Monsters make a crossover appearance in the Rugrats episode, ""Ghost Story"". This is because both shows were created/produced by Klasky Csupo and distributed also by Nickelodeon[citation needed].  In Chile, children's programs and characters from El Mundo del Profesor Rossa (Spanish for The World of Professor Rossa) and Cachureos (Chilean Spanish for odds and ends) conducted a crossover between them for a few minutes in their emissions of Saturday 18 (Mundo del Profesor Rossa) and Sunday 19 (Cachureos) of April 1998 due the debut of the latter program on Canal 13, after several years of broadcast on TVN and even have competed with each other for the child audience.  The Netflix series Harvey Girls Forever! (which back then was known as Harvey Street Kids in 2018) has crossed over with iconic cartoon character Richie Rich for its third and fourth seasons. There is also a crossover episode called ""Scare Bud"", which the show crossed over with Casper the Friendly Ghost.  Special usages  Promotional cameos  Crossovers can take the form of a promotional cameo appearance, used to draw attention to another work of fiction, with little rational explanation in the context of the hosting show's narrative. When not clearly presented as parody, this is frequently scorned by fans as blatant commercialism. A notable example of this is The Simpsons episode ""A Star Is Burns"", in which the character of Jay Sherman (from The Critic) appeared. It originally aired on March 5, 1995 on FOX right before The Critic began its second season, its first season having aired on ABC. This episode was largely condemned by fans of The Simpsons as existing to promote The Critic, an animated series considered inferior by comparison. Even Simpsons creator Matt Groening objected, preferring to remove his name from the credits of that particular episode in protest.[18]  The character Dan Tanna (played by Robert Urich) from the detective series Vega$ appeared in an episode of Charlie's Angels (""Angels in Vegas"") one week prior to the debut of Vega$. However, it is not considered a spin-off because Dan Tanna was introduced in the pilot that was aired as an ABC TV Movie of the Week on the evening of Tuesday, April 25, 1978. The crossover was simply used to reintroduce the Dan Tanna character and to promote the debut of Vega$ as an ongoing series. Additionally, the cast of The Love Boat appeared in the fourth season premier of Charlie's Angels (""Love Boat Angels"").  In 2010, as a nod to the 50th anniversary of Coronation Street, characters in fellow established TV soap EastEnders made reference to watching the special anniversary episode.[19] EastEnders had celebrated its own 25th anniversary earlier in the same year.  The two CBS Daytime game shows (The Price Is Right and Let's Make a Deal) are used for promotional cameos from other CBS properties. Promotional cameos from the two daytime dramas, primetime shows (including primetime airings), and sports properties are common. Price has been used to promote anniversaries of CBS daytime dramas, the NCIS franchise, the three reality shows, and CBS Sports' coverage of the NFL.  Spin-offs  In its simplest and most common form, a television crossover involves a starring character on a parent show appearing on a spin-off or vice versa because of established character relationships. An obvious example of this type of crossover occurred when Cliff Huxtable of The Cosby Show visited his daughter, Denise, on A Different World. Another example of this is The Bionic Woman, which was a spin-off from The Six Million Dollar Man. Jaime Sommers was a tennis pro who was nearly killed in a skydiving accident, but her life was saved by Oscar Goldman (Richard Anderson) and Dr. Rudy Wells (Martin E. Brooks) who surgically implanted her with bionic parts similar to those of Steve Austin. Steve Austin and Jaimie Sommers often crossovered, while the characters Oscar Goldman and Rudy Wells appeared regularly in both shows. Another example would be the appearances made by Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters to Angel in Los Angeles from Sunnydale; in a striking example, ""Fool for Love"" and ""Darla"", shown on the same night, contain overlapping flashbacks as remembered by Spike and Darla respectively. There is also Frasier, which features characters from the first show, Cheers. Similarly, Dallas characters J. R. Ewing, Bobby Ewing, Lucy Ewing and Kristin Shepard all appeared in its spin-off Knots Landing while Knots Landing characters Gary Ewing and Valene Ewing each made several appearances on Dallas after Knots Landing premiered.  More complex multi-production franchises can utilize crossovers of characters to serve as a device in establishing continuity in a shared fictional universe. This crossover is common in the Star Trek universe, where minor guest stars from one series have appeared as featured guest stars later ones. A good example of this crossover is that of the Klingons Kor (from the Original Series episode ""Errand of Mercy""), Koloth (from ""The Trouble with Tribbles"") and Kang (from ""Day of the Dove""). After the passage of about a century of narrative time, the three onetime adversaries of Captain Kirk appeared together in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode, ""Blood Oath"" – as the Klingons and Federation had become allies in the century between, the former villains are now portrayed as heroes. Another Klingon, Arne Darvin, appeared as a secondary character in ""The Trouble with Tribbles"", but was the principal villain of DS9's ""Trials and Tribble-ations"". Intended as a celebration of the franchise's 30th anniversary, ""Trials and Tribble-ations"" was actually a crossover in and of itself; using then brand-new bluescreen techniques, the episode places the DS9 cast (after hijacking the Defiant, Darvin had gone back in time hoping to kill Kirk and become a hero to the Klingons, and it's up to Sisko and his comrades to stop Darvin and preserve the timeline) inside the TOS episode, interacting with James T. Kirk, Spock and the rest of the Enterprise crew.  The distinction between ""spin-off"" and ""crossover"" is sometimes narrow. The two terms can become especially conflated if two shows are linked by a guest star with a single appearance. There is debate, for instance over whether Out of the Blue is a spin-off of Happy Days, or whether the star of Out of the Blue merely crossed over into Happy Days.  Mako Mermaids, a spinoff of H2O: Just Add Water, featured a guest appearance by Rikki Chadwick, a main character from the former series, in its final two episodes, thus confirming that the spin off-acts as a sequel rather than a prequel or alternative storyline as many fans suspected.  Parodic crossovers  Often, the problems of bringing together two shows with different narrative ambitions make the writing of a crossover burdensome. Such difficulties are encountered by situation comedies that wish to crossover with dramatic television programs. The satirical crossover—ranging in length from a cameo to a full comedy sketch or episode—is an extremely popular way of circumventing this problem. By various means, such crossovers typically avoid outcry from fans by being obvious parody or homage. However, on rare occasion, the humor of such crossovers can be used by one show make a narrative point by capitalizing on the audience's experience of the other program.  Such tongue-in-cheek crossovers typically fall into one of several broad categories.  Parodic crossovers can be directly established as being outside the continuity of one or all of the properties being crossed over. A good example is the crossover between The Simpsons and The X-Files, which was largely accepted as being outside standard X-Files continuity.  One episode of The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy shows that after Mandy smiles, she, along with Billy and Grim, are transformed into The Powerpuff Girls with a cameo by Professor Utonium.  They can occur by virtue of a dream sequence, in which the characters of one show will appear as part of a dream had by a character on another show. This method was perhaps used most famously to explain to audiences that the entirety of Newhart had been the dream of Bob Newhart's character on The Bob Newhart Show. It has more recently been used to demonstrate that cast members of The Young and the Restless appeared in a dream of a character on The King of Queens.  Parodic crossovers can take the form of ""gag"" cameos by characters of one property appearing on another. Characters from King of the Hill have appeared on The Simpsons to comment on a peewee football game. Gag cameos may also include the appearance of an actor from another show, but not necessarily the character that the actor played. For instance, on the ABC/CBS show Family Matters during the closing credits of the episode ""Scenes From a Mall"" (Season 5, Episode 12), a scene which was shown earlier in the episode featuring Reginald VelJohnson is re-played, but this time with one of the child actors stating that he ""looks like that fat guy from Fresh Prince,"" referring to James Avery who played Judge Phillip Banks on NBC's The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. To the obvious surprise of the studio audience and VelJohnson, Avery walked onto the set with an angry look, being in on the staged joke himself. Ended the episode (but with the cameras filming still), VelJohnson and Avery hugged and smilingly greeted the public.  Crossovers of this type can also be completely wordless. This type of crossover is more common on animated programs, such as when Bender found and ate Bart Simpson's shorts on Futurama, or Milhouse had a talking Bender doll on The Simpsons. This would seem to be another case when a popular franchise is acknowledged as fiction and not a crossover of the stories.  Perhaps the most obvious parodic crossover is found when characters from two series interact outside either series. This occurs most commonly on a sketch comedy show or as a humorous interlude on an award telecast. Such crossovers may sometimes involve the real actors—for example, a sketch on Royal Canadian Air Farce saw Yasir and Sarah from Little Mosque on the Prairie buying the gas station from Corner Gas, with many of the characters in the sketch being portrayed by the shows' real actors—although they may also feature one genuine star from the show amid a cast comprised otherwise of the sketch show's own stable of actors. Such crossovers are generally immediately apparent as parodies to the audience—and in no way considered a part of either show's continuity—due to the need for the hosting show to approximate the sets and costumes of the satirized programs quickly and inexpensively. When Patrick Stewart appeared in a Star Trek: The Next Generation/The Love Boat crossover on Saturday Night Live, for instance, few Star Trek fans would have been fooled by the visual design into believing the event ""counted"" as an episode of the show. However, there are some cases of this type of parody having some canonical resonance with viewers. For instance, the British charity appeal Comic Relief often contains parodic crossovers of a technically higher quality than the typical sketch show. Many of these Relief sketches are produced by the cast and crew of the actual programs being parodied, and hence appear to be ""normal"" episodes. A good example of this is the sketch, ""BallyKissDibley"", an 11-minute piece in which the leads of Ballykissangel appeared on the sets of The Vicar of Dibley, alongside most of Dibley's cast. Since the sketch derived its humor from all actors remaining in character, the extent to which these parodies ""count"" as part of either show's canon is more open to interpretation than most sketch crossovers.  Parodic crossovers can be used to lend verisimilitude to the fictional world of a program. Characters from a fictional television series may appear on a stylized version of an established non-fictional television series, such as game shows or reality shows. These crossovers between celebrity hosts and fictional characters are quite common on situation comedies. Mama's Family once appeared on Family Feud and the townsfolk of The Vicar of Dibley have had their heirlooms valuated on Antiques Roadshow, for instance. In such cases, it is generally the non-fictional show which ends up being the most satirized, due to a need to compress the experience to its most recognizable elements. However, these crossovers can happen on dramatic television, such as when Blue Peter provided narrative exposition on The Sarah Jane Adventures. Rarely, brief crossovers between two fictional programs can be used for this same purpose. In the episode, ""Army of Ghosts"", Peggy Mitchell was seen in a fictionalized scene from EastEnders in order to demonstrate the degree to which the titular ghosts had permeated the popular culture of Doctor Who's Britain. Here, too, time constraints caused the satire of the guest programme (EastEnders) and not the host program (Doctor Who).  Retroactive crossovers  Sometimes, crossovers occur even when there was no explicit intent to create them. Viewer interpretation can play into the size and complexity of crossovers. These sorts of crossovers involve no creation of additional material, but merely result from inferences drawn about existing filmed episodes. Usually they are a product of narrative ambiguity. Perhaps the best example of this was caused by the unusual ending to St. Elsewhere. One interpretation of the ending scene of the final episode has been that the entire run of the program was a figment of autistic character Tommy Westphall's imagination. This leads itself to a broad interpretation of the events of that series. Because the show had direct crossovers with twelve different programmes, and each one of these twelve had numerous other crossovers, linkages can be found from Elsewhere to 280 other shows, comprising what has been called ""the Tommy Westphall Universe"".[citation needed]  Tokusatsu for Japan  German crossover  One of the earlier instances of crossovers in TV productions outside the US is the episode Unter Brüdern [de] (1990), which was produced by WDR and DFF as a crossover between the West German crime series Tatort and the East German crime series Polizeiruf 110. Their respective popular heroes Horst Schimanski and Peter Fuchs join forces to solve a case in the turmoil of the time after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The episode was produced during the short transition period between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany.  See also",real
15321,"Just how much is Ryan Murphy's creativity worth? If you ask Netflix, a reported $300 million.  The lauded Emmy, Golden Globe, and Peabody Award-winning producer, director, writer, and showrunner has been behind critically acclaimed series like FX's American Crime Story: The People v. O. J. Simpson, Feud, and American Horror Story, as well as Fox's Glee. Despite his success at 20th Century Fox, Murphy has inked a staggering overall deal with Netflix, which one insider told Deadline is ""the deal of a lifetime for an artist of a lifetime.""  Beginning July 1, Murphy and his Ryan Murphy Productions will begin producing both TV shows and films exclusively at Netflix, similar to the deal Shonda Rhimes struck six months ago with the streaming giant after leaving ABC. Like Rhimes, Murphy's move from his longtime home at Fox likely won't affect his hit shows there. Even his upcoming drama Pose, which is still in production with FX, will continue on with the network and be overseen by Murphy for as long as it's on the air. Murphy touched on his future, as well as his scrappy past, in a statement after the Netflix deal was announced:  ""The history of this moment is not lost on me. I am a gay kid from Indiana who moved to Hollywood in 1989 with $55 dollars in savings in my pocket, so the fact that my dreams have crystallized and come true in such a major way is emotional and overwhelming to me. I am awash in genuine appreciation for Ted Sarandos, Reed Hastings, and Cindy Holland at Netflix for believing in me and the future of my company which will continue to champion women, minorities, and LGBTQ heroes and heroines, and I am honored and grateful to continue my partnership with my friends and peers at Fox on our existing shows.""  In other words, you don't need to worry about your favorite Murphy show vanishing from Fox or FX anytime soon. In addition to Pose, American Crime Story is in the midst of its second season, with another on the way. American Horror Story also has at least one more season to go, as does Feud. On Fox, the Murphy-produced 9-1-1 — a medical drama about first responders starring Connie Britton, Peter Krause, and Angela Bassett — was recently renewed for season two, as well.  ADVERTISEMENT  Fortunately it sounds like Murphy will still be around to guide those shows as they move forward, even as he starts branching out with his Netflix projects. The first of those will be an origin story about Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest starring his muse, Sarah Paulson. The other series is titled The Politician, and already has a jaw-dropping cast lined up: Ben Platt, Barbra Streisand, and Gwyneth Paltrow.  Per usual, we can't wait to see what Murphy does next.",real
8311,"WHAT'S WRONG WITH PETER?  If you ask us, not much... but Rachel Lindsay had other ideas on this week's episode of The Bachelorette.  EXCLUSIVE: 'Bachelorette' Rachel Lindsay Reacts to Frontrunner Peter Not Being Ready for Marriage  ""For the first time ever, I'm thinking Peter and I may not work out,"" a tearful Rachel revealed before heading into the fantasy suite on Monday... just days after her family declared him the ""winner"" -- but how did she get to that point? Here's where The Bachelorette's final three guys stand on the family and fantasy suite score boards heading into the finale.    Eric      Family: 8    Fantasy Suite: 8  Eric was a bag of surprises this week, as he managed to win over both Lindsay and her family. Despite the fact that he's never been in love, Eric's meeting with Rachel's family went shockingly well -- getting rave reviews from her sister for his honesty, and winning over her mother's approval (to the surprise of literally no one, honorable Judge Lindsay couldn't make it).  It seems the family's stamp of approval (and a hot tub session?) was all Eric needed to truly let himself go, as he revealed to Rachel during their date in Spain that he was finally in love. Ten years later, because Eric read the date card like he was suffering from spelling bee PTSD, the two headed off to the fantasy suite, where things obviously went well enough for Eric to tell Rachel he loved her 13 times as he walked her to her car the next morning.  ""Once again, I spend time with Eric, and it takes our relationship to another level,"" Rachel gushed. True.  EXCLUSIVE: Rachel Lindsay Says She Doesn't Want Anyone From Her Season to Be the Next Bachelor    Bryan      Family: 5    Fantasy Suite: 0  To be fair, Bryan's 0 in Fantasy Suites is only because the episode ended before his date aired (thanks, Peter!) -- but his time with Rachel's family didn't exactly go well. He came on super strong, which only made her family question his feelings even more.  Rachel, however, wouldn't stand for her family's criticisms, and defended Bryan against their ""unnecessary"" questions. After Rachel had heart-to-heart with her mom, Bryan seemed to  finally catch a break, getting her mom's blessing to ""build on"" their relationship. Not exactly Rachel's hand in marriage, but we think it's probably the best he could've hoped for.  EXCLUSIVE: 'Bachelorette' Castoff Dean Unglert Says Rachel Lindsay Is 'Blinded' By Frontrunner Bryan  Peter      Family: 10    Fantasy Suite: 2  Rachel's family loved Peter so much that they declared him the ""winner"" -- but those good vibes didn't translate to his date in Spain. Peter finally revealed that he was falling in love with Rachel before meeting the parents, but in Spain, he said that he's still not ready for a proposal.  This didn't sit well with Rachel. The two forgot all about their cute winery date as they engaged in an argument about their possible engagement. In Rachel's eyes, engagement is the promise to get married down the line, but Peter said he's not getting down on one knee until he's ready to plan the wedding.  ""I didn't come this far and put my life on hold and sacrifice everything to do this to just have a boyfriend at the end of it. That's not what I want, because I could have done it without all this,"" Rachel explained, before things got teary.  ""For the first time ever, I'm thinking Peter and I may not work out,"" she confessed after their fight, while in the promo for next week's episode, Peter asked, ""What's wrong with me?""

3105,"(CNN) Taylor Swift has used her latest video to throw some shade and let the world know she's heard everything people have been saying about her.  Swift premiered the video for ""Look What You Made Me Do"" Sunday night at MTV's Video Music Awards and it was a lot to take in.  The singer, who had been keeping such a low profile for so long that fans had started to worry, posted in an Instagram caption over the weekend saying ""There will be no further explanation. There will just be reputation.""  It was a clever tease, given that "" Reputation "" is the name of her new album set to drop on November 10.  There will be no further explanation. There will just be reputation. A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Aug 25, 2017 at 4:54am PDT  Since Tay has yet to give the low down on what it all means, we'll attempt to break it down for you:  The death of her rep  The singer gets right down to it, opening up her video with a tombstone that reads ""Here lies Taylor Swift's reputation"" before a zombie version of Swift climbs out of the grave.  And how did her reputation die?  The viewers don't get a cause of death, so one is left to assume Swift is making a statement about all the bad press she's gotten in the last year or so with everything from her break up and spat with producer and DJ Calvin Harris, to her highly-publicized falling out with rapper Kanye West and his wife, Kim Kardashian.  Swift and the couple have had competing narratives as to whether Swift signed off on West calling her a ""b***h"" in a song lyric.  Some fans think Swift took a shot at West with the lyrics ""I don't like your little games, don't like your tilted stage/The role you made me play of the fool, no, I don't like you."" The rapper's last concert tour featured a floating and tilted stage.  The moment at the end of the video when Swift said ""Getting receipts, gonna edit this later"" as she pointed her camera phone and mimicked the act of recording a video was interpreted by some fans as a swipe at Kim Kardashian, who was said to have ""brought receipts"" to her husband's spat with the pop star.  Said ""receipts""-- an internet catchphrase used to call for proof or evidence -- was a video of a phone conversation between the rapper and Swift, which Kardashian said proved the singer knew about the song lyric she later complained about. Swift shot back at the time that no where did the video show her approving being called a ""b***h.""  Shading an old frenemy?  The internet also has some theories about a scene in which Swift dressed up to look like Katy Perry.  One fan tweeted a screen grab of the scene writing ""#TaylorSwift personates #KatyPerry holding a #Grammy because Taylor has plenty & Katy doesn't have one.""  The two have had a long-standing feud and interestingly enough Perry was the host of the VMAs this year.  Remember the Tay-shirt controversy?  Swift gave a nod to last year's hoopla over then-boyfriend actor Tom Hiddleston, who wore a white ""I Heart T.S."" tank while the pair frolicked with friends at the beach for Fourth of July weekend.  She cheekily had a group of male backup dancers wear crop tops with the same message, though in black, possibly to match the stilettos they rocked.  And if you dig the look, you too can proclaim your love as it's part of the merch for sale on her site.  Taylor Swift Is Selling the 'I Heart T.S.' Crop Tops From the 'Look What You Made Me... https://t.co/UwUDhSdmfT pic.twitter.com/y55sm3Ecxl — Major Celeb News (@MajorCeleb) August 28, 2017  Those snakes  ""Swifties,"" as her die-hard fans are known, were thrilled with the singer owning a bit of her hater history.  #TaylorSwiftIsASnake has been the hashtag for those on Twitter wishing to take the singer to task, and the reptiles showed up in her video, with one even serving her tea.  Old and new Taylor are never ever ever getting back together  Swift's many faces and signature looks of over the years made a stunning appearance rife with symbolism.  Dressed in a furry one-piece which read ""Rep,"" the new Swift stood on a mountain made up of the older versions of herself from different music videos and red carpet appearances.  The old Swifts fight to climb to the top before they are all seen falling away.  And if that imagery wasn't obvious enough, we see the new Swift saying into the phone ""I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now. Why? Oh, cause she's dead.""  Swift mocks Swift  Those old Taylors help Swift close out her music video as she uses them to parody some of the stinging comments that have been made about her over the years.  There's earnest, nerdy Swift from the ""You Belong With Me"" video who was scolded by zombie Swift saying, ""Stop making that surprise face, it's so annoying.""  ""You can't possibly be that surprised all the time,"" said ballerina Swift, who appeared in the ""Shake It Off"" music video.  The just starting out, acoustic guitar version of Swift from her teen years was told to ""Stop acting like you're so nice, you are so fake"" by circus ringleader Swift from the 2012 MTV European Music Awards.  When baby Swift starts to cry, a nearby Swift says ""There she goes playing the victim, again.""  The video ends with the version of Swift who was famously interrupted by West during her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.  Wearing that same off the shoulder gown and clutching her VMA award, Swift utters her now infamous line ""I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative"" which was part of her official statement to the whole West-Kardashian kerfuffle, to which the rest of the Swifts respond with a resounding ""Shut up!""  On Tuesday, YouTube announced that ""Look What You Made Me Do"" had the biggest debut of any video in its history with 43.2 million views in 24 hours.  The previous record holder was Psy's ""Gentleman"" with 36 million views in the first 24 hours.",fake

8628,"It's official: Matt Lanter and his wife Angela's baby girl is here  It’s official: Matt Lanter‘s baby girl has arrived!  The Timeless star and his wife Angela — a blogger behind the popular lifestyle website Hello Gorgeous — welcomed their first child, daughter MacKenlee Faire Lanter, on Saturday, Dec. 30, in Los Angeles, his rep confirms to PEOPLE.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  She weighed in at 6 lb. 11 oz. and measured 20 inches in length.  “The moment our daughter was lifted up and we laid eyes on her was incredible,” Matt, 34, tells PEOPLE. “As a dad, some of my most special moments so far are when she just lays her little body on my chest and falls asleep.”  For Angela, bonding with MacKenlee through nursing has been one of the most amazing moments for the new mom. “Every time I see this perfect little angel baby, she reminds me of the love I have for her daddy and this brand new love I now have for her,” she shares.  The couple had scheduled a Cesarean section, but little MacKenlee “had other plans of her own” when Angela woke up in labor a week early.  “We headed to the hospital thinking it was probably false labor — nope. She was on her way,” Angela shares. “Our doctor made our gentle cesarean so special by allowing us to play our own music in the operating room, letting us witness her being born and giving me the privilege of skin to skin as soon as she was born.”  Matt admits that he was “nervous being in the operating room because it all feels so high-stakes surgical,” but the nervousness fell away when he “saw her and heard her cry for the first time.”  Upon meeting their baby girl, it was love at first sight for the couple.  “She’s the most gorgeous baby ever,” Angela recalls about seeing MacKenlee for the first time. “I just thought to myself, she’s perfect,” says Matt.

Opening up about how fatherhood had been something the he had been looking forward to for a long time, Lanter told PEOPLE in December, “I have a sister. I grew up in a great family and have always seen that as something that I’ve wanted to do.”  “I want to play catch with my kid,” shared the actor. “I want to kick the soccer ball with my little girl. So yeah, I’m excited.”  But although the couple had no problem revealing the sex of their first child before her due date, there was one thing they kept mum on: what they were thinking about naming her.  In December, the 90210 alum told PEOPLE that although he and his wife had an idea of what they were going to name their baby before her birth, they wanted to wait until her arrival before making an official decision.  “We have one that we think we’re going to go with. It’s a family thing,” Lanter said. “We’re not saying what it is yet, but it’s definitely not official because we want to see her first [to name her].”  “She might just not look like the name that we have [picked out]. So we’re going to wait to make it official,” Lanter added.  However, the Pitch Perfect 3 star had previously revealed what they wouldn’t be naming their child, telling PEOPLE that while he and his wife wanted a name that was “a little different,” they weren’t going to give their baby “Apple or Banana or something like that” for a moniker.  “We like the idea of old-fashioned names,” he explained.

538,"This article is about the singer. For her eponymous debut album, see Christina Aguilera (album)  American singer, songwriter, actress, and television personality  Christina María Aguilera ( , Spanish: [aɣiˈleɾa];[1] born December 18, 1980) is an American singer, songwriter, actress and television personality. Her accolades include five Grammy Awards, one Latin Grammy Award, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Aguilera ranked at number 58 on Rolling Stone's list of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time in 2008, and was included on Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2013. With estimated sales of 75 million records, she is one of the world's best-selling music artists.[2]  Born in Staten Island of New York City and raised in Pennsylvania, Aguilera appeared on television shows in her early years, before gaining a recording contract with RCA Records in 1998. Her self-titled debut album, released in 1999, reached number one in the US and spawned three US number-one singles: ""Genie in a Bottle"", ""What a Girl Wants"", and ""Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)"". While recognized as a prominent figure in the contemporary teen pop scene, Aguilera sought to assume artistic control with Stripped (2002) and its lead single ""Dirrty"", which displayed her sexually emancipated persona and generated considerable controversy. The second single from the album, ""Beautiful"", received favorable response for its empowering lyrics and became an anthem for the LGBT community.  Aguilera scored her second US number-one album with Back to Basics (2006), which drew inspiration from early 20th-century jazz, soul, and blues, and spawned the top-ten singles ""Ain't No Other Man"", ""Hurt"", and ""Candyman"". Her next three albums, Bionic (2010), Lotus (2012), and Liberation (2018), all experimented with various musical styles and reached the top ten in the US. Besides solo materials, Aguilera earned chart-topping entries with collaborations including ""Lady Marmalade"", ""Moves like Jagger"", ""Feel This Moment"", and ""Say Something"". Alongside her music career, Aguilera starred in the film Burlesque (2010) and was a coach on six seasons of the singing competition television series The Voice from 2011 to 2016.  Life and career  1980–1998: Early life and career beginnings  Christina María Aguilera was born in Staten Island, New York City, on December 18, 1980, to musician Shelly Loraine Kearns (née Fidler) and United States Army soldier Fausto Xavier Aguilera.[3] Her father was born in Ecuador, and her mother has German, Irish, Welsh, and Dutch ancestry.[5] Her family moved frequently because of her father's military service, and lived in places including New Jersey, Texas, New York, and Japan.[6] Aguilera alleged that her father was physically and emotionally abusive.[7] To cope with her turbulent household, she used music as a form of escape.[8] Following her parents' divorce when she was six years old, Aguilera, her younger sister Rachel, and her mother moved into her grandmother's home in Rochester, a suburb in the Pittsburgh area.[5] Her mother later remarried to Jim Kearns and had a son with him named Michael.[9] After years of estrangement, Aguilera expressed interest in reconciling with her father in 2012.[10]  As a child, Aguilera was drawn to soul and blues records her grandmother bought and would practice singing, which earned her a reputation as ""the little girl with the big voice"" in her neighborhood.[11] She aspired to be a singer, and won her first talent show at age eight with a rendition of Whitney Houston's ""I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)"".[6] Aged 10, she performed ""A Sunday Kind of Love"" on the competition show Star Search, and was eliminated during the semi-final round.[8] She performed the song again on KDKA-TV's Wake Up with Larry Richert. During her youth in the Pittsburgh area, Aguilera sang the US national anthem, ""The Star-Spangled Banner"", before Pittsburgh Penguins hockey, Pittsburgh Steelers football, and Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games, and the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals.[13] She attended Rochester Area School District in Rochester and Marshall Middle School near Wexford, and briefly attended North Allegheny Intermediate High School before being homeschooled to avoid being bullied.[14]  In 1991, Aguilera auditioned for a position on The Mickey Mouse Club, although she did not meet its age requirements. She joined the television series two years later, where she performed musical numbers and sketch comedy until its cancellation in 1994.[15] Fellow cast members included Ryan Gosling, Keri Russell, Britney Spears, and Justin Timberlake.[16] After the show ended, Aguilera moved to Japan and recorded her first song, ""All I Wanna Do"", a duet with Japanese singer Keizo Nakanishi.[17] In 1998, Aguilera returned to the US to seek a recording contract. She approached RCA Records, who told her to contact Disney instead because they were having financial difficulties. She sent her cover version of Whitney Houston's ""Run to You"" to Disney in hopes of being selected to record the theme song ""Reflection"" for their animated film Mulan (1998).[19] Aguilera was ultimately selected to sing ""Reflection""; the song was released in June 1998 and charted on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart at number 15.  1999–2001: Christina Aguilera, Mi Reflejo, and My Kind of Christmas  After ""Reflection"", Aguilera attracted the attention of RCA's A&R Ron Fair and was signed with the label quickly afterwards.[21][22] RCA was pressured by the contemporary teen pop craze evoked by Aguilera's peer Britney Spears, leading to the label rushing production of the album and aligning Aguilera to be part of the teen pop trend. They released the lead single off the album, ""Genie in a Bottle"", a trendy pop and R&B track, in June 1999. The single catapulted Aguilera to stardom, peaking atop the US Billboard Hot 100 and charts of 20 other countries.[24] It has sold over seven million copies as of 2014.[25] Aguilera's eponymous debut album followed in August 1999 and peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200.[6] It was certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA),[26] and had moved 17 million copies worldwide by 2010.[27] The album produced three other singles: two US number-one singles–""What a Girl Wants"" and ""Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)"", and one US top-five single–""I Turn to You"", a cover of All-4-One's song.[28] At the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in February 2000, Aguilera won Best New Artist.[29]  Aguiera's two following studio albums, Mi Reflejo and My Kind of Christmas, were released in September and October 2000, respectively.[30] The former, a Spanish-language album consisting of re-recorded versions of tracks on Aguilera's debut album and several original songs, topped the Billboard Top Latin Albums for 19 consecutive weeks and was certified six times platinum in the Latin field by the RIAA.[26][31] It won Best Female Pop Vocal Album at the 2nd Annual Latin Grammy Awards in 2001.[32] The latter contains covers of Christmas popular songs and a few original dance-pop tunes, and was certified platinum by the RIAA.[26] In support of her albums, Aguilera embarked on her first concert tour, Christina Aguilera in Concert, from mid-2000 to early 2001. The tour visited North America, Europe, South America, and Japan.[34][35] Billboard in 2000 recognized Aguilera as the Top Female Pop Act of the Year.[36] Despite the successes, Aguilera was displeased with the music and image her manager Steve Kurtz had aligned her to, feeling unable to control her own image.[37] In October 2000, she filed a breach of fiduciary duty lawsuit against Kurtz for improper, undue and inappropriate influence over her professional activities. After terminating Kurtz's services, RCA hired Irving Azoff as Aguilera's new manager.[38]  Aguilera took her first steps in artistic control with the 2001 Moulin Rouge! version of Labelle's ""Lady Marmalade"" (1974), a collaboration with Pink, Mya, and Lil Kim, produced by hip hop musicians Missy Elliott and Rockwilder.[11] RCA executives initially opposed to Aguilera recording ""Lady Marmalade"" because it was ""too urban"", but Aguilera ultimately managed to record the song of her own accord.[37] The collaboration topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks based on airplay alone, becoming the first airplay-only track in history to remain on the chart's top spot for more than one week.[39][40] It won Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards.[41] In mid-2001, Warlock Records released Just Be Free, a compilation of demo tracks Aguilera recorded in 1994 and 1995, when she was looking forward to an album release after the end of The Mickey Mouse Club. Aguilera filed a suit against Warlock Records and the album's producers to stop the release. The two parties came to a confidential settlement to release the album, in which Aguilera lent out her name, likeness, and image for an unspecified amount of damages.[43]  2002–2003: Stripped  When planning her fourth studio album, Aguilera leaned towards a new artistic direction that she felt had more musical and lyrical depth.[44] She named the album Stripped and explained that the title represented ""a new beginning, a re-introduction of [herself] as a new artist in a way"".[45] Aguilera served as the album's executive producer and co-wrote most of the songs.[46][47] To present her new persona, Aguilera chose to release ""Dirrty"" as the lead single from the album in September 2002.[48] Its accompanying music video generated controversy for depicting overtly sexual fetishes.[49] Aguilera's new image presented in the video was widely criticized by the public that it began to overshadow her music.[50][51][52] She defended her new image: ""I'm in the power position, in complete command of everything and everybody around me. To be totally balls-out like that is, for me, the measure of a true artist.""[52]  Stripped was released in October 2002.[53] The album incorporates various genres from R&B and flamenco to rock, and lyrically revolves around the theme of self-esteem while also discussing sex and gender equality.[47][54] It received mixed reviews from music critics, who viewed the employment of various musical styles incoherent, but praised Aguilera's vocals.[53][54] The album peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 and has sold over 4.3 million copies in the US as of 2014.[55] In the UK, the album has sold two million copies as of 2017 and was the second highest-selling album by an American female artist during the 2000s decade, behind Norah Jones with Come Away with Me.[56][57] By 2006, Stripped had sold over 12 million copies worldwide.[58] The second single from the album, the ballad ""Beautiful"", received universal acclaim for its empowering lyrics about embracing inner beauty, and became an anthem for the LGBT community.[59][60] It was the album's best-charting single, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[28] The song won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards in 2004.[61]  Stripped was followed by three other singles: ""Fighter"", ""Can't Hold Us Down"", and ""The Voice Within"", all of which were released in 2003 and entered the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100.[28] During promotion of Stripped, Aguilera cultivated a new image by adopting the alter ego Xtina, dyeing her hair black, and debuting several tattoos and piercings.[62][63] She co-headlined the Justified and Stripped Tour alongside Justin Timberlake from June to September 2003 in support of Stripped and Timberlake's album Justified (2002), before embarking on her solo Stripped Tour until December.[64][65] Aguilera attended the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards in August, where she and Britney Spears kissed Madonna during their performance of ""Like a Virgin"" and ""Hollywood"", which received considerable media attention.[66] She was the host of the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards, where she won Best Female award, in November.[67] Billboard announced Aguilera as the Top Female Pop Act of 2003.[68]  2004–2009: Marriage, Back to Basics, and first child  In 2004, Aguilera recorded a revised version of Rose Royce's ""Car Wash"" (1976) with Missy Elliott for the animated film Shark Tale, in which she was a voice actress,[69] and contributed vocals to Nelly's single ""Tilt Ya Head Back"".[70] She was a featured artist on Herbie Hancock's 2005 cover of Leon Russell's ""A Song for You"" (1970), which was nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2006.[71] During this time, Aguilera started working on her follow-up studio album and embraced a new image inspired by figures of the Classic Hollywood era such as Marilyn Monroe, Marlene Dietrich, and Mary Pickford, debuting blonde curly hair and retro-styled makeup.[72][73]  Aguilera became engaged with marketing executive Jordan Bratman, with whom she had dated since 2003, in February 2005.[74] They married on November 19, 2005, at an estate in Napa County, California.[75] Aguilera released the lead single, ""Ain't No Other Man"", from her fifth studio album, Back to Basics, in June 2006.[76] The song, like the majority of the album, was inspired by Aguilera's marriage and incorporates elements of early 20th-century soul, blues, and jazz.[77][78] It reached number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and has sold 1.7 million digital copies in the US as of 2014.[28][55] Its music video saw Aguilera debuting her new alter ego, Baby Jane, inspired by the thriller film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962).[76]  Back to Basics was released in August 2006. Aguilera described the record, a double album, as a ""throwback"" to jazz, blues, and soul music of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s that incorporates ""a modern twist.""[79] She was much inspired by works of such classic blues and soul singers as Otis Redding, Millie Jackson, and Nina Simone during the recording sessions.[80] Back to Basics received generally positive reviews from critics, who commented that the retro-oriented production complements Aguilera's vocals.[81] It debuted atop the Billboard 200 and has sold 1.7 million copies in the US.[55] At the 49th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2007, Aguilera won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for ""Ain't No Other Man"", and performed ""It's a Man's Man's Man's World"" in tribute of the late James Brown.[82] Back to Basics was succeeded by two international top-ten singles: ""Hurt"" and ""Candyman"". Two other singles, ""Slow Down Baby"" and ""Oh Mother"", were released exclusively in Australia[83] and Europe,[84] respectively. In support of Back to Basics, Aguilera embarked on the Back to Basics Tour, which ran from November 2006 to October 2008.[85][86][87] With US$48.1 million grossed, the tour was the highest-grossing solo female tour of 2007.[88]  In January 2008, Aguilera gave birth to her child with Bratman, a son.[89] Later that year, she appeared in the Martin Scorsese documentary Shine a Light chronicling a two-day Rolling Stones concert in New York City's Beacon Theatre, in which Aguilera performs ""Live with Me"" alongside the band's lead vocalist Mick Jagger.[90] In commemoration of a decade-long career in the music industry, Aguilera released a greatest hits album titled Keeps Gettin' Better: A Decade of Hits exclusively through Target in November 2008, in the US.[91] In addition to previous singles, it includes four original electropop-oriented songs, two of which are remade versions of two previous singles.[92][93] Aguilera commented that the newly-recorded tracks' ""futurisic, robotic sound"" served as a preview for her follow-up studio album.[94] Keeps Gettin' Better peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200, and its titular single ""Keeps Gettin' Better"" charted at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100.[28] Billboard in 2009 recognized Aguilera as the 20th most successful artist of the 2000s.[95]  2010–2011: Bionic, Burlesque, and The Voice  Aguilera at a Montblanc event in 2010  Aguilera began work on her sixth studio album during pregnancy, when she frequently listened to electronic music.[96] The lead single from the album, ""Not Myself Tonight"", was released in March 2010.[97] Heavily influenced by electronic genres, the song signaled Aguilera's musical experiments on her forthcoming album.[98] It peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100.[28] The album, titled Bionic, was released in June 2010. Categorized as a R&B-flavored futurepop album by critics,[99][100] Bionic lyrically revolves around sexual themes while also discussing feminism.[101] Critical reaction to the album was mixed; reviewers commended Aguilera's experimentation with new styles, but found it forced and unnatural.[102][103][104] The album peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 and has sold 332,000 copies in the US as of 2019. The album spawned one other international single, ""You Lost Me"". Two other singles from the album, ""Woohoo"" featuring rapper Nicki Minaj and ""I Hate Boys"", were released in the US and Europe,[106][107] and Australia, respectively.[108]  Aguilera starred alongside Cher in the musical film Burlesque.[109] Written and directed by Steve Antin, the film was released in theaters in November 2010.[110] Aguilera played Ali Rose, who quits her bar service job and moves to Los Angeles, where she aspires to be a performer in a burlesque club owned by Tess Scali (Cher). Burlesque grossed US$90 million in the box office[111] and received mixed reviews from critics, who found it clichéd but praised Aguilera's acting.[112] The film received a nomination for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy at the 68th Golden Globe Awards.[113] Aguilera recorded eight tracks for the film's ten-track accompanying soundtrack, and Cher performed the other two.[114] The soundtrack reached number 18 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold by the RIAA.[26][28]  At the Super Bowl XLV in February 2011, Aguilera omitted a few lines while performing the US national anthem.[115] She apologized for the incident, saying: ""I got so caught up in the moment of the song that I lost my place.""[116] At the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards, she performed alongside Jennifer Hudson, Martina McBride, Yolanda Adams, and Florence Welch, in a segment that paid tribute to soul singer Aretha Franklin.[117] Aguilera finalized her divorce from Jordan Bratman, from whom she had been separated since September 2010, on April 15, 2011.[118] She concurrently started dating Matthew Rutler, an assistant on the set of Burlesque.[119] From April 2011 to December 2012, Aguilera served as a coach on the first three seasons of the television competition series The Voice.[120] During the first season, Aguilera was featured on Maroon 5's single ""Moves like Jagger"" upon the invitation of the group's lead vocalist and Aguilera's fellow The Voice coach Adam Levine. The single peaked atop the Billboard Hot 100 and has sold seven million digital copies worldwide.[121][122]  2012–2017: Lotus, second child, and television projects  Christina during a performance in 2014  Upon the third season of The Voice in September 2012, Aguilera released ""Your Body"" as the lead single from her seventh studio album.[123] The single charted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 34.[124] The album, titled Lotus, followed in November 2012. Aguilera described the record as a ""rebirth"" of herself after the personal struggles she had overcome.[62] Contemporary reviewers found the album generic and conventional, as opposed to Aguilera's previous experimental ventures.[125][126] Lotus peaked at number seven on the Billboard 200 and has sold 303,000 copies in the US as of 2019. The album was supported by one other single, ""Just a Fool"" featuring Aguilera's fellow The Voice coach Blake Shelton.[127] In December 2012, Aguilera was replaced by Shakira for the fourth season of The Voice.[128] She returned for the fifth season in September 2013.[129]  In 2013, Aguilera scored three international top-ten singles. She was featured on rapper Pitbull's ""Feel This Moment"", which peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified platinum by the RIAA.[26][28] She subsequently appeared on Mexican singer Alejandro Fernández's cover of Miguel Gallardo's ""Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti"" (1976), which earned a diamond certification in Mexico.[130] Aguilera collaborated with A Great Big World on the ballad ""Say Something"", which earned a six-time platinum certification from the RIAA[26] and won Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards.[131] Aguilera temporarily withdrew from The Voice for the sixth and seventh seasons, citing her desire to devote her time to her family. She was respectively replaced by Shakira and Gwen Stefani during the two seasons.[132][133] After her engagement to Matthew Rutler in February 2014 and the birth of their daughter in August,[134] she returned for the eighth season in October.[135] Aguilera's one more season with The Voice was the tenth, in which she won with her contestant Alisan Porter in May 2016.[136]  Aguilera played a recurring role as singer Jade St. John, a pop singer who tries to venture out to country music, on the third season of ABC's musical drama series Nashville in April 2015.[137] She and her partner Rutler served as executive producers for a music-based game show, Tracks, which aired on Spike TV in March 2016.[138] Aguilera recorded a song titled ""Change"", which she dedicated to the victims of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting as well as Christina Grimmie, who was fatally shot in Orlando the day before the nightclub shooting. The proceeds were donated to the National Compassion Fund to benefit the victims' families.[139] Her other works included recording a disco song titled ""Telepathy"" featuring Nile Rodgers for the soundtrack of Netflix original series The Get Down (2016),[140] being a voice actress for The Emoji Movie (2017),[141] and starring in the romantic science fiction film Zoe (2018).[142]  2018–present: Liberation and The Xperience  Christina Aguilera performing at the Pepsi Center on October 19, 2018 on her Liberation Tour  Aguilera started work on her new album in the summer of 2015.[143][144] Its release was preceded by two singles: ""Accelerate"" featuring Ty Dolla Sign and 2 Chainz and ""Fall in Line"" featuring Demi Lovato.[145][146] The album, titled Liberation, was released in June 15, 2018 to favorable reviews.[147][148][149] Aguilera heavily incorporated R&B and hip hop on the album to represent her desire for freedom from what she described as the ""churning hamster wheel"" that was The Voice.[150] Liberation debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 chart, becoming Aguilera's seventh US top-ten album.[151] At the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, ""Fall in Line"" was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, and the album track ""Like I Do"", which featured GoldLink was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Performance.[152]  To promote Liberation, Aguilera embarked on a US tour, the Liberation Tour, which ran from September to November 2018,[153] and a European tour, The X Tour, which ran from July to December 2019.[154] She also headlined The Xperience, a 25-date concert residency at the Zappos Theater in Las Vegas beginning in May and concluding in March 2020.[155] In 2019, Aguilera received The Disney Legends Awards for ""her remarkable contributions to the Disney legacy"".[156] In October 2019, Aguilera released the song ""Haunted Heart"" from the soundtrack of the computer-animated Addams Family film.[157] On March 6, 2020, Aguilera released ""Loyal Brave True"" as a promotional single from the upcoming live action remake of Mulan.[158] She has also announced that she will release a re-recording of ""Reflection"" during her Xperience show.[159]  Artistry  Voice  Aguilera is a soprano,[160][161][162] possessing a four-octave vocal range spanning from C 3 to C♯ 7 .[163][164] Since the start of her career Aguilera's voice has been compared to that of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston.[165] David Browne writing for The New York Times noted that Aguilera's vocal performance was highly influenced by Carey and Houston, sharing that ""Aguilera has been one of the foremost practitioners of the overpowering, Category 5 vocal style known as melisma"", and ""Ms. Carey, Ms. Houston and Ms. Aguilera, to name its three main champions, are most associated with the period from the late '80s through the late '90s"".[165] A journal by Ann Powers for the Los Angeles Times said there are influences of Barbra Streisand, Gladys Knight and Aretha Franklin on Aguilera's vocal style, opining that the ""Aguilera's Streisand-esque tendencies"" ""[help Aguilera] figure out how to become the 'great singer' she's been dubbed since she released her first single, the wise-beyond-its-years 'Genie in a Bottle', at 18"".[166] Sasha Frere-Jones wrote in The New Yorker, ""Aguilera doesn't need to reincarnate Sarah Vaughan to be a serious singer. She already is one, in the tradition of nineteen-nineties pop and R&B, skillfully deploying melisma for razzle-dazzle"".[167] In 2003, Aguilera was placed fifth on MTV's ""Best Voices in Music Ever"" list,[168] while ranking atop both COVE and Latina magazine's best Pop and Latina vocalist of all time in 2004 and 2013, respectively.[169][170] In a review for Liberation, Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented on Aguilera's vocal versatility: ""Nothing less than high drama suits Christina Aguilera's voice. She can be brassy, tearful, sultry, gritty, breathy, sweet or furious. She can belt and she can tease; she can aim a note as directly as a missile or turn its trajectory into an aerobatic spiral of leaping, quivering, scalloping melismas. Her voice is not an instrument for making modest statements; it's about peaks of self-affirmation, indescribable sensual pleasures, steely counterattacks and abysses of sorrow"".[171]  Aguilera has, however, been criticized for her excessive use of melisma and oversinging on songs and in concerts.[172][173][174][175] John Eskow of The Huffington Post named Aguilera a main proponent for ""oversouling"", described as the ""gratuitous and confected melisma"".[176] Lucy Davies, a writer for BBC Music, opined that although Aguilera had ""a stunning voice"", she ""could be more varied, simply by cutting out some of the 'y-e-e-eeeh, woah yeh's'"".[177] Longtime producer Linda Perry, who wrote the song ""Beautiful"", revealed about the recording sessions with Aguilera, ""I tried to keep it straight. I told her to get rid of the finger waves. Every time she'd start going into 'hoo-ha', I'd stop the tape. I'm like, 'You're doing it again'"". Perry ended up using the song's first take adding, ""She had a hard time accepting that as the final track. She's a perfectionist. She knows her voice really well, and she knows what's going on. She can hear things that nobody else would catch.""[178] An editor from Entertainment Weekly, Chris Willman, stated that the oversinging on Aguilera's albums was inspired by Carey, writing that ""the Mariah venerators don't get away with it so easily. Aguilera, for one thing, has a slightly nasal tone that really only becomes obvious when she's overselling a song"".[173]  Influences  (pictured) as her main influence Aguilera cites Etta James as her main influence  Aguilera has credited blues singer Etta James as her main influence and inspiration, elaborating, ""Etta is my all-time favorite singer. I've said it for the last seven years – since I had my first debut record out – in every interview"".[179] Following James' death in 2012, Aguilera was asked to perform ""At Last"" at James' funeral.[180] Prior to the performance, Aguilera revealed, ""There's a line in this song that says 'I found a dream that I could speak to.' And for me that dream, all my life, has been Etta James"".[181] Other classic artists, including Billie Holiday, Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, Nina Simone, and Ella Fitzgerald, are also Aguilera's major influences; her fifth studio album Back to Basics is inspired by vintage jazz, blues and soul music records by them.[182][183][184]  Aguilera mentions Whitney Houston as another influence,[185] having performed many of her songs in her early years during talent shows.[6] She also cites Mariah Carey and Celine Dion as an inspiration, and covered the latter's songs: ""These Are the Special Times"" on My Kind of Christmas, and ""The Prayer"" on the NBC reality singing competition The Voice.[186][187] Aguilera's debut album producer Ron Harris revealed that Aguilera during her recording sessions for Christina Aguilera would constantly listen to Brandy's music, studying and trying to replicate her adlibs.[188] According to author Pier Dominguez of the book Christina Aguilera: A Star Is Made, Aguilera stated that Carey and her debut single, ""Vision of Love"" (1990), had the biggest influence on her vocal style.[189] Aguilera points out the musical film The Sound of Music and its lead actress, Julie Andrews, as her first inspiration for singing and performing.[190] At the age of six, the film helped Aguilera cope with her violent childhood, ""Bad things happened in my home; there was violence. The Sound of Music looked like a form of release.""[8] Aguilera credits Madonna and Janet Jackson as two biggest inspirations for her image, ""for being re-inventive and being brave as strong females, to explore whatever, even if they do get bad press. It's just like they were fearless.""[191] During the promotion of Back to Basics, her image was also inspired by the ""Golden age of Hollywood"" actresses including Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe, Carole Lombard, Greta Garbo and Veronica Lake.[192] Aguilera is also inspired by her Burlesque co-star, Cher: ""I have always had tremendous respect for her. She is a woman who did everything before anyone else did it. She is an icon and she inspired me through some of my career. We've had similar costumes too!""[193]  Musical style and themes  Aguilera frequently blends elements of pop, R&B, dance-pop and soul music into her projects,[194][195][196] and her records typically include a combination of ballads and uptempo tracks.[197] Christina Aguilera (1999) prominently displayed teen pop and dance-pop music,[198] while Mi Reflejo (2000) takes inspiration from Latin music.[199] Her first Christmas album, My Kind of Christmas, combines covers of Christmas standards and several original dance-pop tracks.[200] Aiming for musical diversity and artistic growth, Aguilera worked with R&B, rock, hip hop, and Latin music for Stripped (2002).[37][201] David Browne from Entertainment Weekly credited the release with distancing Aguilera from her pop contemporaries.[201] Aguilera leaned towards R&B, blues, jazz, and soul on Back to Basics (2006).[79][202][203]  In contrast, Bionic (2010) sees significant use from futuristic electronic music, described as an electropop album.[204][205][206] The soundtrack for her 2010 feature film Burlesque (2010) was influenced by Cabaret, and featured several established songs that were redone as dance numbers in a fashion similar to Moulin Rouge! (2001).[207] Aguilera partnered with mainstream producers including Shellback and Max Martin during production of Lotus (2012); when discussing her interactions with the latter, she commented that ""He's known about me but we haven't crossed paths,"" adding ""Those records were the kind I wanted to stray apart from. If you look at what I did in the past (after my debut), I always try to do things that will challenge me and challenge the listener, too.""[208]  Aguilera stated that she feels a sense of responsibility to reference portions of her personal life so that ""people that can relate might not feel as alone in the circumstance."" Many of her works consequently discuss love; she has also co-written two tracks which dealt with the domestic abuse throughout her childhood.[209] Aguilera has frequently mentioned feminism in her music; she has expressed her belief that sexuality is ""very empowering"", and has commented that ""If I want to be sexual, it's for my own appreciation and enjoyment! That's why I like to talk about the fact that sometimes I am attracted to women. I appreciate their femininity and beauty.""[210] She has alluded to her physical attractions to women in other interviews as well.[211][212] Her ""Can't Hold Us Down"" from Stripped denounces gender-related double standards, in which men are applauded for their sexual behaviors, while women who behave in a similar fashion are disdained.[213] The main theme of Bionic was also about woman empowerment; Hermione Hoby from The Guardian opined that ""she incites more of a sisterly spirit of collaboration, including riot grrrl feminists Le Tigre. Aguilera's not shy of the odd feministic declaration herself.""[160] In regards to production, Aguilera has often verbalized her preference of working with more ""obscure"" collaborators, and noted that she is not necessarily inclined to contact ""the No.1 chart-toppers in music"" because of their popular demand.[214] The New York Times' Kelefa Sanneh described her decision to work with DJ Premier on Back to Basics as ""a decision to snub some of the big-name producers on whom pop stars often rely.""[215]  Image  Aguilera has reinvented her public image on numerous occasions throughout her career.[216] In the later 1990s, her then-manager Steve Kurtz marketed her as a bubblegum pop entertainer to capitalize on the genre's financial lure,[44] which earned her recognition as a teen idol.[217] Aguilera introduced her alter ego ""Xtina"" during 2002 and 2003, which presented an increasingly provocative persona.[218][219] During this time, she dyed her hair black, debuted several piercings, and participated in several nude pictorials for publications.[62] In 2004, Aguilera embraced a more ""mature"" image with retro-styled hair and makeup, which was inspired by classic movie stars including Marilyn Monroe, Marlene Dietrich and Mary Pickford.[73] This reinvention was named ""Baby Jane"" in 2006, an alter ego which was taken from the 1962 film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?.[220] Aguilera received widespread criticism over her curvy figure from gaining weight in 2012.[221] She later received favorable media attention after a significant weight loss in 2013.[222] In 2018, Aguilera appeared bare-faced without makeup and retouching on the cover of Paper magazine and received widespread praise.[223][224]  Wax figure of Aguilera at Madame Tussauds in London  Aguilera is considered a pop icon,[225] and has frequently garnered comparisons to Britney Spears.[226][227] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said that Aguilera is ""too eager not to offend"" in her mild-mannered music, making her a ""good girl pretending to be bad"", and also said that Spears' ""artificial-sweetener voice"" was a welcome change of pace from Aguilera's ""numbing vocal gymnastics"".[228] Matthew Horton from Virgin Media suggested that Aguilera was a more impressive performer than Spears despite her lower sales figures.[226] Aguilera has also been regarded as a sex symbol.[167][229] A 2003 issue of Maxim magazine that she covered became its best-selling issue;[230] Aguilera was named ""Sexiest Woman of the Year"" by its subscribers later that year,[231] and also earned the magazine its best-selling issue after posing on the cover that year.[232] Additionally recognized as a gay icon,[233][234] she was the first honoree on The Abbey's Gay Walk of Fame for her contributions to the LGBT community.[235] The music video for ""Beautiful"" earned Aguilera a GLAAD Media Award for its positive portrayal of the LGBT community.[236]  Fashion has also been a part of Aguilera's music career and image.[237] She has frequently worn clothes designed by Roberto Cavalli, John Galliano, Marc Jacobs, and Alexander McQueen.[238][239] During the Back to Basics Tour in 2006, Aguilera performed in a stole made of fur designed by Roberto Cavalli, unaware that it was made from real fur of a white fox. After receiving a video about the treatment of foxes from PETA vice president Dan Mathews, Aguilera replaced it with a faux-fur stole, further stating that she was ""very upset"" because she ""only ever wears fake fur"".[240] Aguilera's costumes from Burlesque were featured in the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising's Art of Motion Picture Costume Design exhibition.[241] Wax figures of Aguilera are located at Madame Tussauds wax museums in London and New York City.[242][243]  Legacy  As of 2018, Aguilera had sold over 75 million albums and singles worldwide.[244] Aguilera's works have earned her numerous awards and accolades, including five Grammy Awards.[245] Various artists have noted that they were inspired by Aguilera, including Ariana Grande,[246] Tinashe,[247] Lady Gaga[248] Sam Smith,[249] and Lauren Jauregui,[250] among others.[251][252][253] Her work has also inspired some athletes, including American figure skater Johnny Weir[254] and American swimmer Dana Vollmer.[255]  Aguilera's use of sexual imagery has helped catalyze public discourse on sexuality and feminism. Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett, co-founder of The Vagenda, opined that the provocative dance routines in Aguilera's music videos are ""empowering"".[256] Aguilera is also known for her television and music video impact; in 2012, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times commented that Aguilera ""will be remembered for her glamour, her scandalous take on femme-pop and her Brobdingnagian voice, and ... as the person who almost single-handedly reshaped music-competition reality programming"".[257] She was considered as one of the greatest women of the music video era by VH1.[258]  Writing for The Hampton Institute, critic Terry Young, Jr. commented that Aguilera ""redefined the 21st century female pop performer,"" adding that following the release of Stripped, ""artists like Spears and Beyoncé became more comfortable expressing sexuality and no longer felt the need to sell the notion of innocence"".[259]  In November 2008, Rolling Stone placed Aguilera at number 58 on its list of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time, writing that ""[Aguilera] has had the finesse and power of a blues queen ever since she was a child star"".[260] In November 2010, Aguilera was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[261] In October 2012, Aguilera's costumes and video collection was included on the ""Women Who Rock"" exhibition by the National Museum of Women in the Arts.[262] That same year, VH1 named Aguilera the eighth greatest woman in the music industry.[263]  At the 2013 People's Choice Awards, Aguilera was awarded the People's Voice Award, which recognized her ability to reach people across various genres.[264] Also in 2013, Aguilera was one of Time's 100 Most Influential People in the World. In the article for the magazine, Celine Dion wrote, ""Without a doubt, [Aguilera]'s one of the most talented artists the world has ever seen and heard, and I think she's going to continue to amaze us for many, many years to come.""[265]  In 2019, the Human Rights Campaign honored Aguilera with its ""Ally for Equality"" award. She was recognized as an ""LGBTQ icon"" who used her platform to share a message of hope and inspiration.[266][267]  Other ventures  Philanthropy  In 2000, Aguilera supported a program called Come on Over and Do Something, which aimed to ""encourage kids to get involved in their communities and make a difference.""[268] A year later, she signed a letter from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) to the South Korean government requesting that the country stop its alleged killing of dogs for food.[269] In 2010, Aguilera auctioned tickets for her planned tour for Christie's A Bid to Save the Earth, which benefited the non-profit environmental groups Conservation International, Oceana, Natural Resources Defense Council, and The Central Park Conservancy.[270] Aguilera contributed US$200,000 to the Women's Center & Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh in December 2003,[271] and was part of the Lifetime Television's ""End violence against women"" campaign.[272]  In 2005, Aguilera contributed ""Beautiful"" to the compilation album Love Rocks, which proceeds benefited the Human Rights Campaign.[273] Aguilera participated in the AIDS Project Los Angeles' Artists Against AIDS ""What's Going On?"" cover project, and became the face for MAC Cosmetics and spokesperson for MAC AIDS Fund in 2004. Singer Elton John featured Aguilera in his charity book 4 Inches, which benefitted the Elton John AIDS Foundation.[274]  Aguilera (left) and Novak (right) were honored with the George McGovern Leadership Award in October 2012 for their contributions to the United Nations World Hunger Relief effort, while Clinton (center) was given a special tribute  In the run-up to the 2004 United States presidential election, Aguilera was featured on billboards for the ""Only You Can Silence Yourself"" online voter registration drive run by the nonpartisan, non-profit campaign ""Declare Yourself"". In these political advertisements, shot by David LaChapelle, Aguilera was shown with her mouth sewn shut to symbolize the effects of not voting.[275] In late 2007, Aguilera became the spokesperson for ""Rock the Vote"", through which she encouraged young people to vote in the 2008 presidential election.[276] In 2005, Aguilera donated her wedding gifts to American charities in support of Hurricane Katrina victims,[277] and performed at ""Unite of the Stars"" concert for Unite Against Hunger in Johannesburg, South Africa and for the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund at the Coca-Cola Dome.[278]  In 2008, Aguilera headlined London's Africa Rising charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall, which raised awareness for finding substantial issues facing the continent.[279] That year, Aguilera appeared on the Turkish version of Deal or No Deal, Var mısın?

2123,"9th episode of the eighth season of Friends  ""The One with the Rumor"" is the ninth episode of the eighth season of the American television situation comedy Friends, which aired on NBC on November 22, 2001.[1] It continues the series' annual Thanksgiving-themed episode tradition, and guest-stars cast member Jennifer Aniston's then-husband Brad Pitt in the uncredited role of Will Colbert, who reveals that he and Ross (David Schwimmer) were part of an ""I hate Rachel"" club. The two of them hated Rachel Green (Aniston) and got the exchange student from Thailand to join their club. Will revealed that they spread a rumor in high school that Rachel was a hermaphrodite.  The episode was directed by Gary Halvorson and written by Shana Goldberg-Meehan.[1] It was nominated for multiple Primetime Emmy Awards, but was criticized as ""insulting"" by a national intersex education group.  Plot [ edit ]  Monica invites an old school friend of hers and Ross' for Thanksgiving, Will Colbert (Brad Pitt). She also tells a crestfallen Joey that she won't be cooking a turkey because of Will's, Chandler's, Rachel's and Phoebe's aversion to the poultry. Joey admonishes Monica and demands the tradition, and so Monica obliges with a monstrous bird. Throughout the episode, Joey battles the enormous turkey, eventually changing into Phoebe's maternity clothing to ease the strain on his stomach.  Will arrives and is revealed to have lost an enormous amount of weight. However, he reacts very badly when learning that Rachel, who he hated in high school because of her bullying him, will be joining them for dinner. Rachel is immediately attracted to Will, unable to recognise him, but Will is openly hostile and this culminates in his proud announcement that he – and Ross – founded the ""I Hate Rachel"" club in high school and initiated a rumour that she was a hermaphrodite, which was spread throughout their entire high school. Rachel feels betrayed by Ross, until Monica reminds her that she started a rumor of her own that Ross made out with the school's 50-year-old librarian, though a horrified Ross confirms it as true. Rachel demands that Ross recant the rumour by calling everyone from school, but Monica puts them both in their place by reminding them that Rachel's rumour put Ross on the social radar, that Ross and Will's rumour had no effect whatsoever on Rachel's queen bee status, and that they're having a baby together. Will is completely dumbfounded by this revelation, but takes pleasure in the fact that Ross got Rachel pregnant but isn't going to marry her.  The episode culminates in Joey finishing off the turkey and getting the meat sweats. Despite being extremely full, Joey still had room for pie.  Production [ edit ]  It was reported by Entertainment Weekly that Pitt would don a fat suit for flashback scenes to his fat childhood,[2] though this was unfounded as Will's weight was merely referred to on screen.[3] Pitt frequently visited Aniston at the studios before and after his appearance, though he did not go onto the set for fear of distracting the audience.[4] When questioned about his appearance in the show, Pitt said it was to promote his upcoming film Spy Game, though added that he liked the series anyway.[3] The episode was taped on November 2, following four days of rehearsals.[5]  Reception [ edit ]  As the series finale drew close in 2004, Eric Deggans of St. Petersburg Times ranked Pitt as one of the worst guest stars in Friends: ""Stilted reactions, overly exaggerated comedy, near-palpable self-consciousness – despite his cred as a film actor, Pitt knew he was out of his depth on a sitcom stage. After five minutes' viewing, the audience did, too.""[6] His work on set is admired by the main stars; Schwimmer recalls Pitt was ""definitely ... going against type""[7] and Matt LeBlanc called him ""really great on the show"".[4] USA Today rates Will's line ""Look at her standing there with those yams. My two greatest enemies, Ross. Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates"" one of the best of the episode.[8]  The eponymous rumor drew criticism from the intersex community, a member of which wrote a strongly worded letter of complaint to NBC, calling the episode ""ignorant, insulting, degrading, and absolutely unprofessional"". The member urged the network to learn about intersex individuals via the Society's website and read an on-air apology before future episodes.[9]  Primetime Emmy Award nominations [ edit ]  Pitt was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his appearance in the episode. Additionally, Nick McLean was nominated for Outstanding Cinematography for a Multi-Camera Series, while Stephen Prime was nominated for Outstanding Multi-Camera Picture Editing for a Series, for their work on the episode.[10]  References [ edit ]",fake
2942,"Two decades strong! James Brolin and Barbra Streisand are nearing their 20th wedding anniversary this year.  ET’s Katie Krause spoke with Brolin at the Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries winter Television Critics Association red carpet on Saturday, where he revealed that despite his decades-long romance, he still doesn't have all the answers.  “I don’t know, because nobody trains you,” he said of the secret to his and Streisand's marriage. “This is my third time -- third marriage. I picked difficult situations the first two times, but I think you learn with each one. I’m a person that believes that if I’m wrong, that’s when I learn, and when I’m right, I haven’t learned a thing.”  Noting that he takes his relationship “day to day,” Brolin revealed that he’s an advocate of marriage counseling.  “I do believe in counseling if anybody ever has a problem in their marriage. Bring in a referee, talk it over, and I swear to you, it will dispel by the end of the session, each time!” he said. “Sometimes in a tough marriage, it’s tough to talk, but if you do, it works!”  The 77-year-old actor has also learned to maintain his marriage with Streisand by not interrupting her during hectic times.  “When she’s busy, she’s really focused, and part of our good relationship is that I understand that,” he shared. “And if I come to her with something important and she says, ‘I don’t have time right now,’ she doesn’t have time, period. That’s the way the mind works. You gotta focus.”  As for how Streisand, 75, makes him feel special, Brolin said, “I’m always welcome when I get home. I always get notes, ‘Hurry home!’ When I get there, there’s always something kind of great waiting for me, some plan, and I try to reciprocate.”  RELATED CONTENT:  Barbra Streisand Calls Out Golden Globes for Not Awarding More Female Directors  ‘Girls Trip' Star Tiffany Haddish Says She Taught Barbra Streisand All About Cardi B  Josh Brolin on His Ripped Bod and How He Knew Wife Kathyrn Boyd Was the One (Exclusive)  EXCLUSIVE!

2650,"Travis Scott has pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct after being arrested during a concert in Arkansas in May 2017 on charges including inciting a riot, Us Weekly confirms.  The 25-year-old rapper’s attorney Jon Nelson tells Us that his client’s case was quietly resolved in January through plea negotiations. Scott (real name Jacques Webster) pleaded guilty to the lowest charge and was required to pay $640 in court-associated costs, in addition to $6,825.31 to two people who said they were injured at the concert. The other two misdemeanor charges — inciting a riot and endangering the welfare of a child — were dismissed.  “Obviously, [Scott] would not in any way want a riot to break out at his concert. That would not be good for him as an entertainer,” Nelson says. “To think that he incited one is ridiculous. We think the police way overcharged him. The prosecutor’s office finally did the right thing — they made an offer that he agreed to. … If anyone was hurt, Travis expressed concern from the beginning. He wanted to make sure those people were taken care of.”  The attorney added that he believes the disorderly conduct charge could eventually be expunged from Scott’s record.  The Rogers Police Department told Us at the time of the arrest that the “Goosebumps” rapper “encouraged people to rush the stage and bypass the security protocols to ensure concertgoer safety.” He was taken into custody at the Benton County Jail and released later in the evening.  The news of Scott’s guilty plea comes just a few days after he became a father with girlfriend Kylie Jenner, who gave birth to the couple’s daughter, Stormi, on Thursday, February 1. A source exclusively told Us that the 20-year-old reality star is “loving starting a family” with Scott, whom she began dating in April 2017.",fake

4419,"Roseanne Barr net worth: Roseanne Barr is an American comedian, actress, writer, television producer, director, and politician who has a net worth of $80 million. Barr began her career in stand-up comedy before appearing in the television sitcom Roseanne (1988–1997; 2018). She won an Emmy and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her work on the show.  Early Life: Roseanne Cherrie Barr was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, in November 1952 to a Jewish family. She is the oldest of four children of Helen, a bookkeeper and cashier, and Jerome, a salesman. Her father's family were Jewish emigrants from Russia, and her maternal grandparents were Jewish emigrants from Austria-Hungary and Lithuania. Her paternal grandfather changed his surname from ""Borisofsky"" to ""Barr"" upon entering the United States. Her Jewish upbringing was influenced by her devoutly Orthodox Jewish maternal grandmother. Barr's parents kept their Jewish heritage secret from their neighbors and were partially involved in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  At six years old, Barr began lecturing at LDS churches around Utah and was elected president of a Mormon youth group. At 16, Barr was hit by a car and was left with a traumatic brain injury. Her behavior changed so radically that she was institutionalized for eight months at Utah State Hospital. While institutionalized, she had a baby, whom she put up for adoption. In 1970, when Barr was 18 years old, she moved out by telling her parents she was going to visit a friend in Colorado for two weeks, but never returned.  Career: She started her career doing stand-up comedy and appeared on The Tonight Show in 1985. In 1986, she performed on a Rodney Dangerfield special and on Late Night with David Letterman. In 1987, Barr had her own HBO special called The Roseanne Barr Show, which earned her an American Comedy Award for the funniest female performer in a television special. Barr was offered the role of Peg Bundy in Married… with Children but turned it down. In her stand up routine in the late 80s, she popularized the phrase ""domestic goddess"" to refer to a homemaker or housewife. The success of her stand up act led to her own series on ABC, called Roseanne. Roseanne originally aired from 1988 to 1997 and was revived in 2018. The show aired 224 episodes and has been popular in syndication. For her work on the show, Roseanne won a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy for Best Actress.  From 1998 to 2000 she hosted The Roseanne Show and in 2011 she hosted a show called Roseanne's Nuts. Outside of TV, she appeared in movies including She-Devil, Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, Blue in the Face, Meet Wally Sparks, Cecil B. Demented, and more. She starred in the 2016 documentary film Roseanne For President! and was a judge on the reality TV series Last Comic Standing from 2014-2015. Over the years she has continued to perform standup comedy.  On April 28, 2017, it was reported that Barr, along with most of the original cast, were shopping an eight-episode revival of Roseanne, with Barr serving as producer, to various networks and Netflix. In May 2017, ABC picked up the revival for mid-season 2018. On March 27, 2018, the revived, 10th season of Roseanne premiered to high ratings. On March 30, 2018, ABC renewed the series for an 11th season, with thirteen episodes. On May 29, 2018, the series was canceled by ABC in the aftermath of a tweet by Barr that was widely considered to be racist.  Personal Life: In 1970, when she was 17, Barr had a child, Brandi Ann Brown, and put her up adoption; they were later reunited.  On February 4, 1974, Barr married Bill Pentland, a motel clerk she met while in Colorado. They had three children: Jessica, Jennifer, and Jake. Pentland and Barr divorced on January 16, 1990.  Four days later, on January 20, 1990, Barr married fellow comedian Tom Arnold and became known as Roseanne Arnold during the marriage. Barr had met Arnold in 1983 in Minneapolis, where he opened for her stand-up comedy act. In 1988, Barr brought Arnold onto her sitcom, Roseanne, as a writer. Barr filed for divorce from Tom Arnold on April 18, 1994, in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, citing irreconcilable differences.  Barr is also remembered for singing a widely panned version of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" before a baseball game between the San Diego Padres and Cincinnati Reds in San Diego in 1990. She sang off-key while spitting, and grabbing her crotch, apparently mimicking the actions of baseball players. Barr later said that the Padres had suggested she ""bring humor to the song,"" but many criticized the episode, including President George H. W. Bush, who called her rendition disgraceful.""  In 1992, Barr received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  Barr is on the autism spectrum.  In November 1994, she became pregnant through in-vitro fertilization and had a son named Buck with Ben Thomas, who at one time was her personal security guard. On February 14, 1995, Barr and Thomas got married at Caesars Tahoe with a reception at Planet Hollywood. The couple divorced in 2002.  Roseanne has had many cosmetic procedures including work on her stomach, breasts, and nose. She also had gastric bypass surgery in the late 90s.  Barr elicited criticism in July 2009 when she posed as Adolf Hitler in a feature for the satirical Jewish publication Heeb magazine, called ""That Oven Feelin.'""  Barr ran for president in 2012 as part of the Green Party. Although she did not win the nomination, she went on to be nominated by the Peace and Freedom Party and came in 6th in the popular vote for President.  Roseanne and partner Johnny Argent live on a macadamia nut farm in Hawaii.  Salary Highlights: During the last season of her sitcom, Roseanne earned $21 million in salary.  Real Estate: When Barr and Arnold were married, they began construction on a 28,000 mansion in southeast Iowa in 1993. After their divorce in 1994 construction was halted and the half-finished mansion sat crumbling for decades. In 2018, when Roseanne the sitcom was rebooted, it was revealed that Barr and Arnold, donated the 1,338-acre property to the Indian Hills Community College Foundation, which sold it to MJW Hawkeye LLC. A spokesman for the owner said that the mansion was too expensive to tear down.  In 2007, Barr purchased a 2,212-square-foot ranch-style house and 46-acre property sight unseen on the Big Island, Hawaii for $1.78 million. The property, known as Hidden Hamakua Farm, in Honokaa/Hamakua. She moved there from Los Angeles full-time in 2010. Barr's property has 2,000 macadamia nut trees, an organic garden, and a beehive.",fake

And so for that I’m really sorry.”  “A lot of those women are my dear friends and I love them and respect them and support what they’re doing and want to be a part of that change … But I should get in the back seat and close my mouth for a while.” Matt Damon on the #TimesUp movement. pic.twitter.com/jNjiIjuhVl — Kathie Lee and Hoda (@klgandhoda) January 16, 2018  Of the #TimesUp movement, Damon said, “A lot of those women are my dear friends and I love them and respect them and support what they’re doing and want to be a part of that change and want to go along for that ride.

His comments earned him backlash on social media, including from his “Good Will Hunting” co-star Minnie Driver. “God God, SERIOUSLY?” Driver tweeted in response.

1654,"Meghan Markle is constantly being compared to Kate Middleton, but this isn’t much different than when Kate first arrived on the royal scene and was compared to a famous princess. Kate was compared to Princess Diana, so comparisons among royal watchers are nothing new. Reports that Meghan Markle was having a hard time winning the queen’s acceptance first surfaced when Prince Harry’s new girlfriend was discovered by the media. Today, it doesn’t look like the friction is coming from the royal brood, but rather from one of her very own family members.  Meghan Markle did something refreshing and something a bit different than the usual royal protocol from decades past of keeping things under wraps. During a Vanity Fair interview, she had no qualms about making the revelation “We’re a couple. We’re in love” and offering up to the world just how happy she is with Harry, according to Fox News. She was so enthusiastic about her new love that the article was titled, “Meghan Markle, Wild About Harry.”  It has been seen in various reports on how the protocol that comes along with being royal dictates different aspects of a suitable spouse. In Meghan’s case, it was because she was previously married that the headlines suggested that the “Queen might not attend Prince Harry’s wedding,” like the one seen published in July from the U.K.’s Express.  Then there were the “jealousy” headline rumors suggesting that Kate was “jealous” of Meghan. One such article was seen back in March from Celeb Dirty Laundry. They claimed that Kate may be jealous of Meghan’s “sexy confidence” on the red carpet, which was a rumor going around at the time in the media. Meghan appears to be able to weather the rumors until they finally disappear from the headlines.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are reportedly 'as good as engaged' ???????? https://t.co/AZZedEbq1W pic.twitter.com/qaQ4JXYHxq — Glamour (@glamourmag) October 4, 2017  Today, reports indicate that Meghan has had an easy time of winning her place among the royals, as her meetings with Kate, William, and the queen have been reported as going well, according to an article last month from Us Weekly. At one point during the young courtship of Harry and Meghan, the media was being rather nasty to Meghan and Prince Harry actually made a rare response to the press asking them to lay off. According to USA Today, Prince William also publicly backed his brother’s request.  While Meghan is hitting it off with the royal family, it seems her “estranged half-sister” might not be in the celebrating mood. While the rest of the world appears to be celebrating Meghan and Harry being on the cusp of an official engagement, her half-sister has a few things that might add some friction to the situation.  Prince Harry and girlfriend, actor Meghan Markle, seen holding hands in public for first time at Invictus Gameshttps://t.co/GSwbzWr2pZ pic.twitter.com/j3gcg4YPxs — BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews) September 25, 2017  According to Fox News, Meghan’s half-sister’s name is Samantha Grant, “who is reportedly shopping around a tell-all memoir about growing up with Markle.” The book Grant is proposing to various publishers “includes a scathing assessment of the Hollywood star.” She is quoted as writing, “Hollywood has changed her. I think her ambition is to become a princess… The truth would kill her relationship with Prince Harry.”  The working title of the book is The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister, according to Page Six. According to Fox, Meghan wrote an essay for Elle Magazine about growing up biracial in 2016. Back then she wrote, “My dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American. I’m half black and half white…To describe something as being black and white means it is clearly defined. Yet when your ethnicity is black and white, the dichotomy is not that clear. In fact, it creates a grey area. Being biracial paints a blurred line that is equal parts staggering and illuminating.”  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle broke with tradition this week, but where do you stand on the handholding debate? https://t.co/d1R0kTw9f0 pic.twitter.com/AZIr1U5o7G — British Vogue (@BritishVogue) September 30, 2017  According to Page Six, Grant shares the same father as Meghan, but because she has a white mother, she is not biracial like her sister. In the book, she talks about what Meghan dealt with growing up and how it changed Grant’s life as well. Prince Harry and Prince William have had their share of tell-all books that have been penned about their mom. Their mom Princess Diana has not only been the topic of a few books but she’s been the topic of a few documentaries and movies as well. Grant claims, “the truth would kill her relationship with Prince Harry, ” but after what he’s gone through with the media regarding his mom, it might take more than a book to ruffle Harry.

5947,"Time for your regular reminder that over the next four days, I'll be giving my quick reactions to the trailers presented to advertisers in New York City. These aren't formal reviews. How could they be? I haven't seen the darned shows. They're just gut responses to sales pitches. If advertisers can pony up billions based on these clips, I can tell you if they're good or bad. My annual Take Me to the Pilots series will begin in a month and then real reviews will start in September. It's a marathon, not a sprint.  One day after CBS took advertisers back to the '80s with shiny new versions of Murphy Brown and Magnum P.I., The CW closed out broadcast TV's upfronts week with another healthy dose of nostalgia.  Expanding to six nights of original programming in the fall, the network presented a schedule with five new shows premiering between fall and midseason, two of which — Charmed and Roswell, New Mexico — will induce young adult soap opera flashbacks. Another of the shows, Legacies, didn't have any footage to show yet, but as a spinoff of The Originals (itself a spinoff of The Vampire Diaries), it also brings a measure of familiarity.  Without further ado, let's get to The CW's trailer rankings.  4) In the Dark | I don't pay as much attention to development as I used to, so I hadn't heard a word about In the Dark. I have to admit that my first instinct after seeing the ridiculous poster for this dramedy was to think it was a parody show. A parody of what? For what? I have no idea. I didn't get that far. And my first instinct after watching the first half of the trailer was to think that this had to be some sort of hastily made filler programming for CW Seed. It was only when I saw John From Cincinnati himself (Austin Nichols, who is no longer on the show) in the trailer that I began to realize that this story of a sex-addicted blind misanthrope attempting to solve a murder with the help of her nosey support dog Pretzel was a real series that will air on real television. I'm still not completely convinced. The trailer was tonally muddled, extremely cheap-looking and made me giggle in several totally inappropriate places. Pretzel looks like a very good dog, though. Good dog, Pretzel!  3) Charmed | I was not a Charmed viewer. I must have watched two full episodes ever. The only time I'm aware of the show is when I watch basketball at night on TNT and there's a repeat of Charmed on the next morning. I'll probably watch more episodes of this remake, which pushed its female empowerment message hard in its first trailer. Jennie Snyder Urman's Jane the Virgin track record has definitely bought this one a few extra hours from me, though I wish more of Urman's sense of humor was pushed to the forefront, because that's what I'll be watching and hoping for. I think stars Melonie Diaz, Sarah Jeffery and Madeleine Mantock all seem OK, though the magical effects look mighty middling.  2) Roswell, New Mexico | Wasn't this one supposed to come with some sort of immigration subtext? I was looking forward to that. The trailer eschewed that angle, if it still exists, in favor of sudsy supernatural romance. As it should. It's a sales pitch and not one aimed at me. I'm a Jeanine Mason fan dating back to her run on So You Think You Can Dance and her small part on Bunheads, so I'm definitely the target demo for her debut as a TV lead (assuming you forget the ABC sword-and-sandals epic she did a couple years back and her brief stint on Grey's Anatomy this season). As with Charmed, I'd love to have seen a shade more humor in a trailer that is very, very, very earnest. Other than a little Southwestern ambiance, this trailer looked interchangeable with The CW's very short-lived Star-Crossed from a couple years ago, and I refuse to exist that all alien-human love stories are identical!  1) All American | This is one of the best-cut trailers I've seen all upfronts week, perhaps the best. I'm pumped enough for this show that I'm going to get over my punctuation anxiety that makes me desperately want to add a hyphen. Unlike In the Dark — still not convinced it's a real show — I'd heard about this one, but I hadn't fully realized how completely it's The O.C. only with football. Watch the trailer again. It's so nearly a beat-for-beat remake that Josh Schwartz should be getting a tiny slice of residuals, right down to the rich kids' bacchanal party and somebody sneering ""Welcome to..."" (in this case ""Beverly Hills"") to our main character. Plus, Taye Diggs as Peter Gallagher! Yes, the mustache-twirling racism of the adversarial white characters looks over-the-top, but I appreciated the one joke undercutting gang stereotyping. This looks fun, emotional, corny and inspirational in equal measures and I am there for it! Or at least now I'm excited to watch a full pilot.  Check back in around a month for the start of my annual Take Me To The Pilots series.",real
18915,"SZA’s debut album Ctrl was a labor of love. Initially set for release at the end of 2015, Ctrl experienced not one, but two setbacks before it finally dropped on June 9, 2017. Now, all the hard work has paid off because the RIAA revealed on Thursday that the album has officially gone platinum.  Fully aware that you only get one debut album, SZA admits that she was incredibly particular about which songs made the final cut. “I freestyle everything, all the way down,” she told The Guardian. “And I listen back and think, what’s shitty? And if something’s too shitty and I can’t put my finger on it, and I think, wow this sucks to me, then I get way frustrated, and usually scrap the song. I just kept fucking everything up. I just kept moving shit around. I was choosing from 150, 200 songs, so I’m just like, who knows what’s good any more?” SZA says the final product only came about when the record company took her hard drive.  Ctrl was nominated at this year’s Grammys for Best Urban Contemporary Album, and the 27-year-old singer received a Best New Artist nom of her own. Before the album was released, SZA grew incredibly frustrated with her situation with her label Top Dawg Entertainment that she briefly quit, telling TDE co-president Terrence ""Punch"" Henderson to release the project “if he ever feels like it” in a tweet that has since deleted. All that is now water under the bridge and Punch was one of the first people to congratulate SZA on her latest achievement.  And speaking of albums, SZA told MTV News in December that she made it her 2018 resolution to start working on her next album and “not drag it out.” We'll just have to see about that.",real

After lots of speculation, James Gunn told Newsbeat she's in the new film for ""half a second"".  He said the wrecking ball singer agreed to voice a new character alongside legendary actor Sylvester Stallone.  The film is out on 28 April, reuniting the cast from the original movie which came out almost three years ago.  ""Well I can't really tell you guys because it's a spoiler in itself to talk about it,"" the director explained.  ""But, near the very end of the movie, there's a new character introduced for just a moment who speaks for half a second with Sylvester Stallone.""

'I love her voice, I think it's amazing'  He says he wanted Miley because her voice has ""a great harshness to it that is awesome"" and he thought ""it would be perfect for a robot"".  When asked about the third intergalactic blockbuster, the director told Newsbeat we could be seeing more of her character.  ""I would love to see Miley come back and do more stuff with us and I'd love to see that character come back.  ""It's a real fun character, I have good things in store.""

4387,"Boozy Blake Back On The Bottle — After Gwen Made Him Quit! Shelton was caught stocking up on spirits while Stefani was out of town.  ‚I do … want another drink? Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton’s wedding plans could be on hold, RadarOnline.com has learned, after the No Doubt front woman asked her fiance to put down the bottle — and he headed to the liquor store!  Shelton recently dropped 85 pounds on Stefani’s no-booze wedding diet, according to an insider. But then, late last month, he was caught leaving an L.A. liquor store with enough swill to soak Skid Row for a month.  What’s more, the bad boy launched his booze-buying spree just hours after Stefani, 47, chatted it up with late-night TV host Seth Meyers 2,500 miles away in New York City!  “When Gwen is away, Blake seems to play! Or, at the very least, take a few cheat days,” a source told Radar.  Shelton’s box bulged with multiple bottles of tequila, and was packed so tightly that even the burly 40-year-old struggled to carry it only a few feet to his car!

17928,"Last Man Standing will be without two of its original cast members for its upcoming revival on Fox. Molly Ephraim and Flynn Morrison, who played Mandy and Boyd Baxter — the middle daughter and grandson, respectively, of Tim Allen’s Mike Baxter — during the series’ run on ABC, have opted not to return for Season 7. Both roles are in the process of being recast, Deadline has confirmed.  Created by Jack Burditt, Last Man Standing stars Allen as a married father of three girls who tries to maintain his manliness in a world increasingly dominated by women.  The rest of the show’s core cast is back including Allen, Nancy Travis, Jonathan Adams, Amanda Fuller, Christoph Sanders and Jordan Masterson. Also back is co-star Hector Elizondo whose deal to return — made last month — was originally in second position to his NBC comedy pilot Guess Who Died. That pilot was not picked up by the network and was shopped unsuccessfully. The options on the cast recently lapsed, rendering everyone, including Elizondo, available to take other series jobs.  Kevin Abbott, who served as an executive producer on the original series for most of its six seasons on ABC, with stints as showrunner in Season 1 and the second half of Season 6, is back as executive producer/showrunner for Season 7. He will be joined by three other veteran Last Man Standing writer/executive producers: Matt Berry — who also served as showrunner on the original — Kevin Hench and Ed Yeager.  Last Man Standing, from 20th Century Fox TV, is slated to return to its longtime Friday 8 PM slot in the fall.  Deadline’s sister site TVLine was first to report the recastings.",real
8083,"SANTA CLARITA, Calif. – Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling, bejeweled and festooned in fantastical garb, are peering over a young teen who lies crumpled on the ground.  “She’s giving in to the darkness,” says a hushed Winfrey, whose eyebrows have been replaced with clusters of purple gemstones.  “Breathe, sweetie,” coaxes a flame-haired Witherspoon, as a regally costumed Kaling looks on, worried. Storm Reid, then 13 and playing A Wrinkle in Time’s protagonist, Meg Murry, flutters her eyes.  More:These images from 'A Wrinkle in Time' will make you emotional  Related:10 books to read before they become movies in 2018  “This is a life or death situation,"" calls out director Ava DuVernay from behind a monitor. ""And, action!”  A Wrinkle in Time, the sci-fi adventure about a teen who combs the universe for her missing father, will hit theaters March 9 — 56 years after author Madeleine L'Engle debuted her sci-fi novel, a work that defied skeptics by featuring both quantum physics and a young girl at its center.  L'Engle's mind-bending fantasy, which employs three astral travelers as the girl's guides (Mrs. Which, played by Winfrey; Mrs. Whatsit, played by Witherspoon; and Mrs. Who, played by Kaling), went on to become Newbery Medal-winning required reading in many schools.  Now, Disney's Wrinkle is cracking Hollywood’s glass ceiling, marking the first time any studio handed a budget of $100 million or more to a woman of color.  DuVernay’s inclusive worldview is reflected throughout Wrinkle. In L'Engle's book, Meg Murray is a white teenager from Connecticut; in the film she's an African-American girl from South Central L.A. who comes from an interracial family. The latter is “never commented on, which I think is great,” says a bearded Chris Pine, who plays Meg’s astrophysicist father.  The director also shifted away from the all-white Mrs. characters in L'Engle's book, instead assembling Winfrey, Kaling and Witherspoon as Meg's galactic guides. “I just started to think about really wanting to represent different kinds, cultures, sizes, ages of women,” DuVernay says.  When Winfrey read the script by Frozen's Jennifer Lee, she was taken with ""Ava’s idea for inclusion, diversifying, opening it up so that the Mrs. are not all like Mrs. Doubtfire, little New England biddies, but this eclectic group of star angels who have their own way of being in the world. That was really kind of thrilling to me.""  Kaling, DuVernay adds, “is a piece of the puzzle that is so important, because when we talk about inclusion in this country we say black and white, and we forget all the other people. The three of them together are quite formidable in what they represent for women at large.”  Today, a Girl Scout cookie drive adds an earthly touch on a soundstage cloaked in massive, saturated blue sheets, onto which the computer-generated world of Wrinkle will be overlaid. (DuVernay tosses a box of cookies to Reid once the scene wraps.)  Cameras roll, and Reid pretends to struggle to breathe as Winfrey and cast stand in position on sheets of glass made to look like an iceberg.  DuVerney squints at the screen.  “You’ve got fingerprints I can see all around her,” she says. “It’s supposed to be ice.” A female production assistant runs in, wiping the surface down. The director, dressed in jeans and a black sweatshirt, joins in on hands and knees, pointing out prints to wipe.  More:Oprah wears the most amazing outfits in 'Wrinkle in Time' trailer  Also:10 must-see films of 2018, from the new 'Fantastic Beasts' to 'Mary Poppins'  DuVernay stays on the floor with Reid, softly talking to the young actress, who is playing her first major role. “All right?” she says. The teen nods. “Let’s get another (take),"" says the director.  Once they wrap, Winfrey regally ambles by in her metallic blue lipstick, a blond curly wig and a massive geometric skirt. Today is the second day Pine has worked alongside the mogul. “It’s so cool, man,” he says. “We talked books together the other day,"" trading recommendations. (His was Anthony Doerr's All the Light We Cannot See.)  Embodying Mrs. Which is no joke: It takes two aides to hold Winfrey up as she inches in platform heels toward her tent. “It is a THING,” she says a few minutes later of her getup, while leaning precariously on a stool. “Two people have to help me sit. Three people help me get dressed. Or was it four this morning?”  At night, she says, ""it takes me at least a half-hour just to get (Mrs. Which's makeup) off. See, my own eyebrows are covered, they’re glued down. Those makeup removal pads, I use like 10 of those first, then a makeup remover thing, and then you start the whole washing process.""  Get down to brass tacks, and Winfrey acknowledges she didn’t expect to be here. “I never planned on being in A Wrinkle in Time. It came about because Ava said (the movie was) going to be shooting in New Zealand,"" where production moves the following week. ""I always wanted to go to New Zealand!”  More:10 major milestones for women behind the camera in Hollywood  Earlier:Reese Witherspoon: 'I have 3 legs'; Oprah Winfrey: 'I know you accept my 3d hand'  So much so that Winfrey blocked out Wrinkle’s shooting dates on her calendar to hang out and be a spectator. It was only then that DuVernay, who generally avoids asking Winfrey for favors, asked her to read the script. Winfrey fell for Mrs. Which, a character she calls sort of a Glinda the Good Witch imbued with the wisdom of Maya Angelou.  And now, she’s stuck. Literally.  “I can’t move my arms. Oh, I’m caught,” Winfrey sighs. “This happens all day long.”  What does Winfrey do when she goes home after a day on set in full hair and makeup?  ""I will open the refrigerator in my hotel and get a bad glass of wine. You know, the kind with the cap on it."" She laughs. ""And take a hot bath and (the next day) start all over again.""",real
7327,"Two more grandkids to love! Beyoncé’s dad, Mathew Knowles, confirmed that the singer welcomed twins with her husband, Jay Z.  The businessman, 65, celebrated the babies’ arrival by posting a balloon-covered birthday card to Instagram on Sunday, June 18. “Happy Birthday to the twins! Love, Granddad,” the card read. Knowles captioned the post, “They’re here! #beyonce #jayz #twins #birthday #happy birthday.” (Knowles is already grandpa to Beyoncé’s 5-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy, and Solange Knowles’ 12-year-old son, Julez.)  Knowles’ confirmation, however, angered some of the BeyHive, who thought that the “Formation” singer, 35, should have been the one to announced the twins’ arrival. “Beyonce’s dad had no business telling Beyonce’s announcement. Exactly why he didn’t know she was pregnant until the Instagram post. I can’t,” one tweeter wrote.  They’re here! .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ #beyonce #jayz #twins #birthday #happybirthday A post shared by Mathew Knowles (@mrmathewknowles) on Jun 18, 2017 at 7:12am PDT  “I really hope you had Beyonce’s permission to announce this because otherwise you are so far out of line,” an Instagram commenter wrote. “It’s Beyonce’s news and if she felt ready to announce the birth she would have done it by now.”  Others defended Knowles’ post, though. “It’s completely alright if the grandfather wants to announce it,” one Instagram commenter wrote. Another Instagram user pointed out, “It could be the grandparents or the mother or the father. There’s no tradition.”  As Us Weekly previously revealed, the “Hold Up” songstress and the Tidal founder, 47, welcomed a baby boy and girl on Tuesday, June 13.  Beyoncé announced her pregnancy back in February with a flawless maternity shoot. “We would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed tow times over.

While the couple share a nearly 20-years age difference, they were able to connect over their recent break-ups and the source said 'sparks fly' when they're together.  Selena split from on-off ex Justin Bieber after a brief reunion last Fall, which happened right on the heels of her split from rapper The Weeknd, who now appears to have reunited with his former flame Bella Hadid.

While the couple share a nearly 20-years age difference, they were able to connect over their recent break-ups and the source said 'sparks fly' when they're together. The duo is seen with actor Paul Rudd in 2015 above  'Initially, they leaned on each other for emotional support after going through messy breakups,' explained the source but now the duo are smitten.  'They FaceTime and text late at night and have intimate conversation about where they're going in life and their career goals,' the insider revealed, 'They're extremely honest and open with each other.'

13021,"The Cars, Dire Straits, The Moody Blues, Nina Simone & Sister Rosetta Tharpe were also inducted at 33rd annual ceremony.  The Moody Blues’ Graeme Edge expressed the thoughts of many of the members of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s class of 2018 during the 33rd annual induction ceremony on Saturday night (April 14) in Cleveland’s Public Auditorium. Acknowledging the Moodys’ long period of eligibility before finally being nominated, thanks in part to aggressive campaigning on behalf of the band’s fans, Edge -- the oldest living inductee of the evening at 77 -- said, “It was so long that we were eligible and didn’t make it that I got a real sour grapes [feeling] for everything about it. … When it actually became something for us all to appreciate and have, I did realize that it means the world to me.”  The Moodys -- along with fellow inductees Bon Jovi, The Cars and Dire Straits (and the late Nina Simone and Sister Rosetta Tharpe) -- have long been on lists of acts snubbed for Rock Hall induction. Saturday's more than four-and-a-half-hour ceremony set things right with a prevailing atmosphere of sincere appreciation -- including from fans who sat in pouring rain to watch red-carpet arrivals and in the Public Auditorium’s upper level -- with only a few barbs about the long waits for induction.  The ceremony, which was filmed by HBO for a May 5 premiere, differed from other years in that Rock Hall co-founder Jann Wenner did not address the gathering and there was no finale that brought inductees and presenters together.  The crowd at Cleveland, Ohio's Public Auditorium did not have to wait long for what was the clear main attraction of the night. Following The Killers' tribute to the late Tom Petty with ""American Girl"" (and a bit of ""Free Falling""), Bon Jovi's hour-plus presentation was presided over by Howard Stern, who gave the band an epic, envelope-pushing-but-loving tribute that took Rolling Stone magazine and Rock Hall co-founder Jann Wenner to task (""Jann required years of pondering to decide if this glorious band that sold over 130 million albums should be inducted. What a tough decision."") and essayed on everything from Jon Bon Jovi's use of hairspray to guitarist Richie Sambora's penis size, as well as the fact that Bon Jovi's sales eclipsed the death tolls from the bubonic plague, the American Civil War and atomic bomb drops.  He also led the crowd in singing a chorus of ""Wanted Dead or Alive,"" chided Bon Jovi's desire to own a National Football League franchise (New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and the Dallas Cowboys' Jerry Jones were band guests on Saturday) and told the frontman that ""I'm glad you don't have to sit at home anymore throwing darts at pictures of Jann Wenner.""  Bon Jovi was equally expansive and earnest in his acceptance speech. Following remarks by each of the band members (""If I wrote a book, it would be [called] The Best Time I Ever Had,"" said Sambora, returning to the ranks after leaving for good in 2013), Bon Jovi delivered a nearly 20-minute aural career history, thanking bandmates, management, record company executives, friends and family. ""I've been writing this speech many days, in many ways -- some days, it's the thank you speech, some days the f--- you speech,"" he noted, acknowledging the group's long and controversial exclusion from the Rock Hall. But he kept things mostly positive and sentimental. ""It's about time -- that has been the theme of my weekend,"" Bon Jovi said, looking at his bandmates. ""I thank my lucky stars for the time I got to spend with each of you. Tonight the band that agreed to do me a favor stands before you so I can make this reality a dream.""  With Sambora and original bassist Alec John Such reuniting with the group, Bon Jovi finished with a crowd-pleasing set that included ""You Give Love a Bad Name,"" ""It's My Life,"" ""When We Were Us"" from last year's This House Is Not for Sale album and ""Livin' on a Prayer.""  Without a designated presenter, Dire Straits bassist and co-founder John Illsley took it upon himself to do the honors and subsequently make an acceptance speech. He quickly addressed the elephant in the room -- frontman Mark Knopfler's decision not to attend -- cracking that ""I can assure you, it's just a personal thing,"" adding, ""It's for personal reasons, let's just leave it at that. You've got to realize this is really more about a group of people more than one person. It's a collective, a brotherhood, and that's something that needs acknowledging tonight … the many musicians who have worked with Dire Straits over the years and made the band's success possible and led us all the way to Cleveland tonight.  Soft-spoken keyboardist Guy Fletcher noted, ""I never thought of Dire Straits as a particularly cool band. … We weren't really there to be cool."" He also told the group's fans to ""consider this award yours, but if you don't mind, I'll look after it.""  The Cars, inducted after two previous times on the ballot and ushered in by Killers frontman Brandon Flowers (""The Cars were the first band I truly fell in love with, and you never forget your first""), spent much of their time paying homage to late bassist/singer Benjamin Orr, a native of Cleveland, much to the delight of the partisan Public Hall crowd. ""When the band first started, Ben was supposed to be the lead singer and I was supposed to be the good-looking guy in the band -- but after a couple of gigs, I kinda got demoted to the songwriter,"" Ric Ocasek, sporting a glittery silver tuxedo jacket, said. ""But obviously it's hard not to notice that Benjamin Orr is not here. He would've been elated to be here on this stage. It still feels strange to be up here without him.""  The group's set, with Weezer's Scott Shriner on bass and bushy-bearded drummer David Robinson looking sagely behind his kit, included ""My Best Friend's Girl,"" ""You Might Think,"" ""Moving in Stereo"" -- which Flowers called ""the best song in any movie scene that pictured a girl getting out of a pool taking her top off"" (Fast Times at Ridgemont High) -- and ""Just What I Needed.""  Both Nina Simone’s younger brother Dr. Samuel Waymon and inductor Mary J. Blige made unapologetically long speeches, with the former thanking Jon Bon Jovi for giving him license to “take as much time as necessary to say what I need to say” about the iconoclastic, genre-blending singer who was the surprise inclusion in this year’s class. While Blige noted that Simone “could sing anything,” Waymon -- who managed her for many years -- said that “it is the oddest thing for you to induct her because [Simone] is a non-conformist, a non-traditionalist.” He warned artists that “if you’re sampling her, you better pay for it” and added that “she’s sitting next to you. She’s soaring over us tonight.” Andra Day and The Roots followed with renditions of “I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free” and a spectacular “I Put a Spell on You,” while Lauryn Hill came on for a long, showstopping set of “Black Is the Color of My True Love’s Hair, ” “Ain’t Got No, I Got Life” and “Feeling Good,” accompanied by video footage of Simone herself.  Alabama Shakes' Brittany Murphy made brief remarks inducting Sister Rosetta Tharpe as this year's Early Influence, calling her ""the godmother of rock 'n' roll"" before delivering a sharp rendition of ""That's All.""  In addition to the traditional In Memoriam segment, the ceremony featured two specific tributes. The Killers opened the night playing the late Tom Petty’s “American Girl,” slipping a bit of “Free Fallin’” into the final verse, while Heart’s Ann Wilson and Alice in Chains guitarist Jerry Cantrell performed an emotive duo version of Soundgarden’s “Black Hole Sun” to honor Chris Cornell.  The Moody Blues closed the evening after a salute from inductor Ann Wilson, who reminded the room that in addition to the group’s heady musicianship and ethereal, philosophical lyricism, “The Moody Blues are and always have been a kick-ass rock 'n' roll band.” Denny Laine, who co-founded the Moodys as a blues group but left after one album, saluted those who came after him, saying, “I’m really pleased to say these guys…went on to other things, and I’m a big fan. There ya go. The Moody Blues, I love you.”  Little mention was made of co-founder Ray Thomas, who died Jan. 4, but Justin Hayward and John Lodge both thanked American radio disc jockeys who championed the band, while Lodge acknowledged the fans who campaigned so hard for the group, saying, “This is your Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.” Hayward explained that “for us and all the British musicians, this is the home of our heroes. To be celebrated even in the same street, in the same building, even in the same town as Buddy Holly and the Everly Brothers, with the woman who showed us how it all should be done, Nina Simone…it’s a privilege. It means a lot to me.”  The Moodys then picked up their instruments for a set that included “I’m Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band),” a galvanizing “Nights in White Satin” and “Ride My See Saw.”  Saturday’s ceremony also introduced a new category: The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Singles honored six songs that Little Steven Van Zandt said ""shaped rock 'n' roll"" by ""artists in the Rock Hall … at the moment."" The first inductees in the category included “Rocket 88” by Jackie Breston and his Delta Cats (1951), Link Wray and his Ray Men’s “Rumble” (1958), “Louie Louie” by The Kingsmen (1963), Procol Harum’s “A Whiter Shade of Pale” (1967) and Steppenwolf’s “Born to Be Wild” (1968).  Rock Hall President and CEO Greg Harris opened the evening pronouncing that ""in a world that is filled with division, rock connects us."" He also celebrated ""a time of unprecedented growth"" for the museum and announced a $10 million donation from the Key Bank Foundation -- the largest-ever single philanthropic contribution -- which will be detailed later this spring.",real
9460,"“Marvel’s Agents of SHIELD” star Chloe Bennet defended her last name change after a fan questioned her about it on social media this week, saying that the cause was Hollywood racism.  “Changing my last name doesn’t change the fact that my BLOOD is half Chinese, that I lived in China, speak Mandarin or that I was culturally raised both American and Chinese,” she wrote. “It means I had to pay my rent, and Hollywood is racist and wouldn’t cast me with a last name that made them uncomfortable.”  Bennet, whose birth name is Chloe Wang, posted a statement to her Instagram account in support of Ed Skrein’s recent stepping down from his “Hellboy” role after being hit with accusations of whitewashing, as the original character he was set to play was of mixed Asian heritage.

4715,"Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson have been having relationship issues ever since the NBA star was busted cheating on the reality star back in April. Now, rumors are circulating that Khloe has been banned from attending Cleveland Cavaliers games.  According to a May 23 report by Gossip Cop, Khloe Kardashian has not been forbidden from attending Tristan Thompson’s basketball games at home in Cleveland. The rumor originated from a report by Media Take Out. The site claimed that LeBron James specifically asked Tristan to keep Khloe away from Quicken Loans Arena on game days.  “‘Lebron James asked Tristan to ban the Kardashian from all remaining playoff games,’ insisted the website. The outlet maintained the prohibition applied to the NBA finals as well. The online publication cited unspecified “reports” as the basis for its contentions, but a Google search indicated the claims originated with MTO. In fact, when lemmings like HollywoodLife also spread these allegations, they credited MediaTakeOut as the source. But none of the sites that copied the misinformation bothered to fact-check or do any investigating,” Gossip Cop reports.  However, Khloe Kardashian herself seemed to debunk the rumors when she showed up at the Cleveland Cavaliers game with her younger sister, Kylie Jenner, to cheer on her baby daddy. Of course, this isn’t the first time that Khloe has allegedly been banned from the team’s games. Multiple reports have suggested that LeBron James did not want Khloe at the games due to the “Kardashian curse,” which is a rumor that all of the Kardashian women ruin the careers of the men they have dated.  ✨ Day 1 of 2018 ✨ A post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on Jan 1, 2018 at 10:08am PST  Alleged victims of the Kardashian curse include Kim Kardashian’s exes Kris Humphries and Reggie Bush, Khloe Kardahian’s former husband, Lamar Odom, and Kourtney Kardashian’s baby daddy, Scott Disick.  Last year, People Magazine reported that Khloe Kardashian wrote a blog post about her game day rituals for days when Tristan Thompson is playing with the Cavs. Khloe revealed that after the National Anthem plays she always says a prayer asking for Tristan to be protected, saying that it may look like she’s talking to herself, but that she doesn’t want “her baby getting hurt.”  As previously reported by the Inquisitr, Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson are trying to work through their relationship issues after the NBA star was busted cheating on the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star last month, just days before she gave birth to their first child, daughter True. Although they are said to be uncertain about the future, Khloe has been attending all of Tristan’s home games.",fake
8889,"(Warning: This post contains spoilers for the midseason return of “This Is Us” Season 3, which aired Tuesday.)  While offering up an overload of emotional information to Pearson family fans back in November, the midseason finale of “This Is Us” Season 3, called “The Beginning Is the End Is the Beginning,” finally gave us the answer to the question viewers have been asking since the second season finale’s shocking flash-forward ending aired last spring: who the “her” is that Future Randall and Future Tess are preparing to visit.  The answer: Randall’s mother, Rebecca Pearson (played by Mandy Moore).  Yes, just as “This Is Us” wrapped up the first half of its third season, it was revealed that decades from now, Randall (Sterling K. Brown) and his adult daughter — along with Toby and now Beth — are going to see “Randall’s mother,” as Beth puts it to her employee (apparently she’s running a ballet company now?), who she obtains a Pin the Tail on the Donkey game from, as she prepares to join Randall and daughter on this journey.  Also Read: 'This Is Us': Sterling K Brown on What That Election Result Means for Randall and Beth - And Future Randall and Future Beth  Though this “her” revelation didn’t come until the episode’s closing moments — which also included a shocking twist about the fate of Jack’s little brother Nicky during the Vietnam War — we were building to it throughout the entire hour of the Dan Fogelman-created series.  The installment included scenes in the present of Rebecca accidentally upsetting young Tess while trying to address her emerging feelings toward other girls, and then relating to her enough so that she felt comfortable addressing them with her parents. The episode also ended with a fight between our Present Day Beth and Randall, because Randall refused to drop out of the city council race, when the polls show he won’t win and his wife asks him to give up and come back to helping his family.  That spat led to Randall sleeping on the couch, and a not so happy vibe between the happy couple in the present, with some hints in the future indicating the two are only communicating between Adult Tess. Does that mean they separate or even divorce?  Also Read: 'This Is Us' Season 3: 'ER' Alum Goran Visnjic Cast as Beth's Teacher on Backstory Episode  “This Is Us” returned from hiatus tonight with an episode that jumped between the past and present — but didn’t head into the future again.

TheWrap: How did you feel about the reveal Rebecca is the mysterious future “her” we’ve all been wondering about? How soon are we going to find out why everyone is gathering to see her?  Sterling K. Brown: We’ve all [in the cast] known that it’s Rebecca, though the audience didn’t know, and we know why it’s Rebecca and you guys will find out at the end of the season what it is.

Tess and Randall arrive at some sort of facility, and while Tess goes to the bathroom, Randall gives Toby (Chris Sullivan) a call, and asks if he’s “coming down.” Toby says he doesn’t know, but Randall tells him the “she” would want him here, and Toby agrees that he probably should. We see Toby talking to Randall on the phone from a bed — alone — which made us wonder if perhaps the mystery woman could be his wife Kate (Chrissy Metz), or someone close to Kate, and Kate might be dead. Yikes!  Also Read: Hold Up, 'This Is Us' Fans - Mandy Moore Says You Might Actually Like That Guy With the Flowers  “You thought we made it sound like he was talking about Kate — I would say that’s open to interpretation,” co-showrunner Isaac Aptaker told TheWrap at the show’s Season 3 finally in September.  Alright, now we know it’s not Kate, but “Randall’s mother” — a person that is apparently close to Randall, Tess and Toby. And Sterling K. Brown told us that would be the case in the end, because anyone close to the Pearsons is close to Toby.  Also Read: 'This Is Us': Sterling K Brown Tells Us All About the Beth-Centric Episode You've Been Waiting For  “Toby is part of our family now,” Brown said. “So anybody who Randall cares about, Tobias would obviously care about as well. That’s my brother.”  Tess hasn’t seen “her” in awhile  Back on the Season 2 finale, we got our first glimpse of an older Randall and an older Tess. “It’s time to go see her, Tess,” Randall says. Tess responds that she’s “not ready,” and Randall says he’s not either.  The scene is cut in a way that makes us think Beth might be dying (but that was ruled out by Susan Kelechi Watson herself) or maybe something is going on with Deja, who in the Season 3 premiere agreed to let the Pearsons adopt her after her mother relinquished her paternal rights.  Brown also told TheWrap that there’s a specific reason he needs to coax Tess to see “her” — which of course we’ll find out in due time.  Also Read: 'This Is Us' Season 3 Premiere: Showrunners Break Down Jack and Rebecca's Awful First Date  “There’s a reason why he had to seek out Tess in particular,” Brown said. “Yes, there’s a reason why he had to seek out Tess in particular, because Tess hadn’t seen the ‘her’ for some time. And so there’s a reason why it’s time to go and she’s like, ‘I can’t.’ There’s a reason. Other people may have been more easily galvanized, but Tess needed a little more coaxing.”  This is as far in the future as we’ll go  “This future timeline is sort of the furthest that we’ll go in these characters lives and where our series will wrap up,” Aptaker told TheWrap in September, backing up something Fogelman has previously talked about.  “I don’t imagine us going past this time period in the future so in terms of a timeline, this is our ending timeline,” Fogelman said in an interview with EW after the Season 2 finale last spring. “But we may have other past timelines we’re going to introduce in the course of the series, and also other future story lines that we might introduce as well.”  Also Read: 'This Is Us': Mandy Moore Hints Season 3 Premiere Reveals More About Randall's 'Her'  “Well we’re going to give answers in that timeline, but it doesn’t mean it’s a timeline we can’t revisit and sort of push the story forward in that timeline,” co-showrunner Elizabeth Berger told TheWrap. “We’re going to give a lot of satisfying answers regarding that timeline this season — so they’re quickly in store.”  Answers were promised to be coming soon  “I think the plan is that, in the course of the season, you will get a lot of answers,” Fogelman said, during a panel after the LA premiere in September. “The story is not about where it ends up, it’s about how you kind of get there… we’re not going to string it out over seven seasons or anything.”  Moore said Fogelman has, “talked a lot about figuring out who [Randall] is talking about.”  Also Read: 'This Is Us' Season 3: Milo Ventimiglia Hints Jack's Little Brother Nicky Has Some Real Issues  “I think that every episode is offering a more fully realized picture of who that is,” Moore said in an interview with EW earlier this month. “It’s not being dragged for the sake of being cheeky. I think it’s just really brilliant storytelling and, Dan’s old favorite way of describing the show is the mixed up videotapes of home videos. This is exactly that, but we’re leaning a little bit into the future aspect of it.”  Brown previously told EW that we do in fact know this character already.  “It is someone that we have met over the first two seasons, so it won’t be something that comes out of nowhere,” Brown said. “Dan has already spoken to the fact that we’ve already shot parts of how he wants the series to end that’s dealing with that particular ‘her’ as well. I think by about midseason, maybe episode 9 or so, the audience will know who that individual is.”  “This Is Us” airs Tuesdays at 9/8c on NBC.",real
5620,"Last night, Serena Williams returned to the red carpet for the first time after welcoming her first child, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. on September 1. The tennis champ made an appearance at Glamour's Women of the Year Awards in Brooklyn, New York, wearing a mini dress from Versace's Spring 2018 collection.  Getty Images  She looked absolutely amazing.  Getty Images  ""It's been a while since I've been on the red carpet,"" Williams revealed on her Instagram Story. She recalled that her last appearance was at the Met Gala, where she debuted her baby bump, while attending with her fiancé, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. Her green halter gown that evening was also by Atelier Versace.  Last night's look however, had a shorter hemline, sexier body-hugging silhouette. The dress, originally modeled by Gigi Hadid at Milan fashion week in September, is a part of Donatella Versace's tribute collection to her brother Gianni, in honor of the 20th anniversary of his death this year. The range incorporated some of his most famous design motifs, including golden baroque swirls (as seen on Williams' dress), animal prints and pop art.  Williams finished of her look with some light jewelry and simple black pumps, but the real accessory was her hair, which she kept in a taut, high ponytail decorated with gold rings.  Getty Images  The new mom not only wore the same look as Gigi Hadid, she also presented her with an award. While introducing her at the ceremony, Williams even joked onstage, ""Gigi, you are one of the few people on this planet I would leave my baby for—for one night—but for you it shows how much you mean to me.""  The two shared an embrace when Hadid retrieved her trophy.  Getty Images  And they posed on the red carpet together, too.  Getty Images  Now that Williams is back in the spotlight, we're so ready for more empowering moments from her like this one.

2955,"Katie Price's house: take a look inside her HUGE mansion that she 'hates'  Bianca Gascoigne hits back as Katie Price says Kris Boyson is NOT over her  Mark Wright speaks out about ending his friendship with James Argent over drug addiction  Rhian Sugden on Vernon Kay sexting scandal: 'It ruined everything for me - but he got away with it'  From Beyonce's fake baby bump to Marilyn Monroe's murder, we've taken a look back over the most enduring celebrity conspiracy theories of all time. Read on for more...  Kate Middleton did NOT give birth to a baby girl  Yeah, you read that right; some people out there have convinced themselves that the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to Princess Charlotte via a surrogate mother.  Why? Well, for no real reason other than the fact that she looked so good when she appeared outside the Lindo Wing of London's St Mary's Hospital with Princess Charlotte on 2nd May 2015.  One conspiracy theorist, who was quoted in a Russian newspaper, said: “It was a surrogate mother who gave birth but not her. Kate must have been wearing a fake belly showing to the people that she was pregnant. Another added to the Komsomolskaya Pravda: “She did not give birth, I am sure. There is no special maternal look in her eyes - this natural thing is not visible.”  This theory is, quite obviously, nonsense; the Duchess of Cambridge was just lucky enough to have a team of stylists on hand after Princess Charlotte’s arrival – hence the amazing hair, makeup, and coordinating mother-and-baby ensemble.  And the thing about the eyes? Utterly bizarre; all you need to do is look at Kate to see just how much she loves her little girl.  Beyonce is actually Solange's mum  Apparently Beyoncé wasn’t actually born in 1981; yup, someone who claims to work for the Department of Health in Texas supposedly unearthed her birth certificate and claims it has her birth date as 1974.  Gabrielle Union, who was born in 1972, also famously said that she and Queen B were BFFs when they were teenagers - again suggesting that she's a tad older than she says she is.  Cue people claiming that Beyonce got pregnant at around 12 or 13-years-old, had a baby girl, and her family covered it up by pretending Solange was actually Matthew and Tina's daughter.  COULD IT BE?!?!  Probably not; it sounds too much like an EastEnders storyline to us. Also, y'know, there are pictures and videos of them together as children. Children who are THE SAME AGE.  Nicolas Cage is a vampire  There's a photo of a man from the Civil War circulating the interweb, and, yes, it looks a lot like Nicolas Cage.  This has led people to claim that (it pains us to write this) the actor is, in fact, a vampire - and he reinvents himself every 75 years or so. facepalm  Brittany Murphy was murdered by the government  Brittany Murphy died on 20th December 2009 at the age of 32 after suffering a reported cardiac arrest. At the time of her death, the Los Angeles coroner said he believed the cause of death ""appears to be natural"", later stating that it was an accident spurred by medications she was taking to combat pneumonia and an iron deficiency.  But, when her husband, Simon Monjack, died five months later, in similar circumstances to Brittany, her father grew suspicious. Angelo Betolotti obtained hair, blood and tissue samples for independent testing - and they have reportedly revealed the presence of ten separate heavy metals in Brittany's system.  At the time of her death, Brittany reportedly displayed all the symptoms of heavy metal poisoning, including headaches, dizziness, abdominal cramps, coughing, sweating, disorientation, wheezing, congestion and pneumonia.  In a recent interview with Fleur De Lis Film Studios, Brittany's father claimed that his daughter was under surveillance after speaking out in support of Julia Davis, a government whistleblower: ""They were, in fact, under surveillance, including helicopters. Their telephones were wiretapped.  “Vicious rumours, spread by tabloids, unfairly smeared Brittany’s reputation. My daughter was neither anorexic nor a drug junkie, as they repeatedly implied. ""Brittany and Simon were ridiculed […] when they complained of being under surveillance and in fear for their lives. I will not rest until the truth about these tragic events is told. There will be justice for Brittany.”  Do you think there is more to her death than meets the eye?  Tom Cruise hired Katie Holmes to be his wife  As far-fetched as it sounds, plenty of people out there believe that Tom Cruise approached several young Hollywood stars (including Scarlett Johansson) with an offer of a five-year marriage contract.  In exchange for marrying Cruise, the bride would receive a career boost and cash, plus a bonus if she gave birth to a child. For Tom, the marriage would provide him with a child, rehabilitate his increasingly eccentric public image, and finally quash all of those pesky gay rumors.  However sources close to the couple (whom are now divorced) have poured water on the rumours, insisting Cruise was ""completely in love with Katie"".  Plus there's the fact that Katie demanded sole custody of daughter Suri in her divorce filing; surely any pre-existing contract between her and Cruise would have prevented her from doing any such thing?  James Hewitt is Prince Harry's real dad  Hmm. Basically, James Hewitt claimed he had an affair with Princess Diana from 1986 - 1991, and, as he looks a lot like Harry, a lot of people have said he MUST be the prince's real dad.  Harry, being the jokester he is, has never taken the reports seriously - and has even cracked a joke about it. During a visit to Bacon’s College in South East London with William and Kate in July 2012, a young boy shouted across the football field to Wills: “Are you two brothers?”  Quick-witted Harry instantly replied: “We’re not sure.” Oh Hazzer, we love you so.  Marilyn Monroe was murdered  Marilyn Monroe's death remains a mystery, even today, although there is a LOT of evidence to suggest that she was murdered. And we don't say things like that lightly...  While empty pill bottles were found in her room, the room contained no means to wash the pills down (there was no glass and the water was turned off). T  he pathologist, Dr. Thomas Noguchi, could find no trace of capsules, powder or the typical discolouration caused by Nembutal in Monroe's stomach or intestines, indicating that the drugs that killed her had not been swallowed. T  he time of death and witness statements do not match up, phone records have suspiciously gone missing and police claim that Marilyn's housekeeper had changed the sheets - was even washing sheets - when they arrived.  But if it wasn't suicide, who killed her?  In October 2006, under the Freedom of Information Act, the FBI released thousands of classified documents, including a three-page report about Marilyn Monroe.  It detailed Marilyn's affairs with John F. Kennedy, claiming that he had promised to divorce his wife and marry her. But, when Marilyn found out he had no intention of doing so, she threatened to go public with their affair. W  hen you add the contents of this file to the MANY discrepancies in the evidence surrounding Marilyn's death, you can see why so many conspiracy theorists are adamant that Marilyn was murdered.  Khloe Kardashian's dad is OJ Simpson  Khloe Kardashian's stepmother famously claimed that the reality star is not Robert Kardashian's biological daughter.  And, in 2013, OJ Simpson's manager has added fuel to the flames, stating that Khloe ""could be OJ's kid"".  ""It's all going to come out sooner or later,"" Norman Pardo told In Touch Weekly in a new interview about her paternity.  OJ, who’s currently serving a 9-to 33-year sentence in a Nevada prison for kidnapping and armed robbery, hasn't denied that Khloé could be his daughter. “Whenever I bring it up, he giggles.”  Kris and O.J. were close friends before Robert, an attorney, successfully defended the NFL star against charges he’d murdered his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, who was also one of Kris’ dearest friends.  “They all took their vacations together. There was a lot of partying going on back then.""  We doubt Khloe will be too perturbed by the claims.  In fact, she resisted having a DNA test last year, telling Kris Jenner in her typically blunt and hilarious manner: “My dad is Robert Kardashian. My other dad is Bruce Jenner. ""If you f**ked other people during the same time, and you do not know, go on Maury. Like, I don’t care!”  Pippa Middleton wore a fake bum to the royal wedding  It's not so much a hit below the belt as it is a hit below the skirt, is it?  Yup, Mr Bern, a Knight of the Order of Grimaldi in Monaco and an expert on etiquette, claimed last year that the bum which enchanted the world was, in fact, a false.  He said: “But of course she had a false bottom. I repeat it,she had a false bottom. “You take her away from that and she has normal buttocks. It was an optical illusion.  “She knew there were a billion people watching. It was the moment to show it.”  Sounds a pretty bum theory to us - Pippa's shapely derriere couldn't possibly have been faked!  Michael Jackson was chemically castrated  Michael Jackson had a truly amazing voice - but some have claimed that his ability to reach those high notes was all down to chemical castration.  Alain Branchereau, a professor of vascular surgery, insisted that MJ used the synthetic anti-male hormone drug Cyproterone as a cure for his acne.  He said: ""When he was 12, Michael Jackson had acne. We know this, he spoke about it himself as a tragedy.  ""What I think could have happened is that his people suggested this miracle treatment.""  He explained that the drug ""blocks puberty, the voice can't mature,"" stops bodily hair and the larynx from growing, and affects the bones, leaving the body with a slight frame and a large chest. When the treatment is finished, the patient ""keeps a child's larynx all his life in a man's body.""  We will never have proof as to whether or not this is true, but the rumour makes us feel desperately sad.  Paul McCartney died in a car crash- and was replaced by a lookalike  Yeah, you heard us.  A lot of obsessive Beatles fans are CONVINCED that Sir Paul is an impostor and that the real deal was decapitated and burnt to a crisp in a car crash.  Hmm.  Because of all the buckets of money the Beatles contributed to England's tax coffers, their continued success was vital to the financial health of the nation. So the British government, in cahoots with the surviving members of the Beatles, conspired to cover-up Paul's death.  Apparently the evidence we need to believe this theory can be found on the cover of the Beatles' last album, Abbey Road.  Which was, apparently, a way for the other Beatles to confess and alleviate their guilt over the whole body swap thing. The image shows the fab four crossing the road, with Lennon in white (the preacher), Starr in black (the undertaker), ""McCartney"" in a suit and barefoot (the corpse) and Harrison in blue jeans and work shirt (the grave digger).  Paul is out of step with the other boys, suggesting he's not an original bug. Sir Paul, in an interview with Life, has since explained that ""On Abbey Road we were wearing our ordinary clothes. I was walking barefoot because it was a hot day. The Volkswagen just happened to be parked there.""  But the theorists refuse to believe him. Well, they wouldn't, would they? NOBODY BELIEVES FAKE PAUL!  Beyonce faked her pregnancy  Forget the Solange theory; remember how everyone decided that Beyonce faked her pregnancy? Yeah.  It was all based on a moment when Queen Bee sat down for an interview with Molly Meldrum in Australia and her pregnant belly appeared to… well, deflate.  In a strange way.  And she was spotted pulling an ""oops"" face just after it happened, if you believe the extremely slowed-down versions of the moment on YouTube.  Whatever.  We label this one SERIOUSLY far-fetched, but, to all the disbelievers out there, it's safe to say that Bey is a pretty awesome mum to Blue Ivy. Surrogate or not.  Miley Cyrus died in 2010 and was replaced by a lookalike  Yup, just like Paul McCartney. Duh!  Apparently Miley's body was found in the desert way back in 2010 and was replaced by another Disney star, who got plastic surgery to look like her.  You can check out all of the (very flimsy and ludicrous) 'evidence' for the far-fetched theory here  What do you think?  Elvis Presley faked his own death  Elvis may have left the building, but plenty of people are still debating over which route he took.  Yup, there's a persistent belief that ""the King"" did NOT die in 1977, he simply faked his own death.  Sigh.  Elvis was, according to theorists, a prisoner of his own fame. He couldn't go anywhere without being recognised and was forced to experiment with wigs and glasses in a bid to go about his everyday life undetected.  But things got… well, they got too much. He decided to fake his death, say goodbye to Elvis Presley and live out his last years in peace and solitude.  Apparently Elvis, much like Shakespeare's Romeo, knew which drugs he could self-administer to create a deathlike state. His extensive experience with the martial arts and yoga was such that he could slow his heart rate and breathing in order to feign death.  And he was no stranger to using a fake name; government documents report that Elvis used the name John Burrows as an alias when he wanted to travel incognito.  Throw in hundreds of rumoured sightings, a seriously speedy funeral (it happened ONE DAY after the King checked out), a mysterious black helicopter floating around Graceland, an elderly man named Jesse who was snapped hanging out with Lisa Marie's son (his grandson) and a rumoured wax body double in the open casket and you have a recipe for a good ol' fashioned conspiracy theory. A  lthough we have a feeling a lot of people were so desperate to believe this theory that they couldn't help but find ""evidence"" to support it.  Whatever. Long live the King, we guess!  Keanu Reeves is immortal  If you want to see the proof for this theory, it's here - but we can summarise it for you.  Basically, Keanu Reeves looks young. His face has barely a wrinkle upon it since he burst onto our screens way back when - and, after someone found a portrait of Charlemagne, little minds started working in overtime.  They write: ""Aside from the striking resemblance, the account of the death of Charlemagne rise suspicion.  ""First of all he crowned his son just before dying (just like he knew he was going to 'die') secondly his burial was rushed during cold weather this is a clear hint that they needed to bury a body to not rise any suspicion.""  They then go on to find a number of people throughout history who look an awful lot like Keanu Reeves (in the sense that they are also humans with dark hair and eyes), and insist this is proof the actor has 'everlasting life'. This is why, they say, he is so generous in his charitable donations; he has plenty of money leftover from his long old life.  We dispute this theory, naturally; anyone else think Keanu just uses a really good moisturiser?  Kurt Cobain was murdered  The Nirvana singer was found dead at his home in Seattle on April 8, 1994.  It seemed an open and shut case; the singer - who had disappeared from a drug rehabilitation clinic - had, according to his wife, Courtney Love, been suicidal and a suicide note was found.  The initial police report stated that Cobain had been found with a shotgun across his chest and an autopsy ruled that he had died by a single gunshot wound to the head and that he had taken a large amount of heroin.  However, Tom Grant, a private investigator hired by Love to find Cobain after he disappeared from the clinic, believed that the singer was murdered.  He claimed that the amount of heroin in Cobain's bloodstream would have made it impossible for him to have put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. Grant insists an unknown assassin administered the drug and then shot Cobain.  But what about that suicide note?  Well, Grant believed that the supposed ""suicide"" note was actually a letter announcing Kurt's plans to leave Courtney Love and the music business and that references to suicide had been added later.  But who would have wanted Kurt dead? We just don't buy this one.  John Lennon was killed by the US government  The former Beatle was shot dead outside the Dakota building in New York where he lived by Mark David Chapman on December 8, 1980. Chapman was jailed for murder and is still in prison.  Case closed, right? Wrong.  Obviously.  Conspiracy theories, unable to let it go, have claimed that Chapman was programmed by US government agents to kill Lennon - and that they used the novel Catcher in the Rye as a signal to go ahead with the operation.  But why on earth would the government want to kill John Lennon? It just doesn't make any sense.  Bruce Lee kicked his way out of his coffin  Martial arts legend Bruce Lee was pronounced dead at the tender age of 32, due to swelling of the brain.  But, being so young and healthy, people immediately became sceptical.  And, after Bruce's coffin lid had to be replaced, many assumed he'd kicked it off and escaped to live a better life.  Where?  In Brussels.  Hey, don't blame us - we don't come up with these ideas!  North West is the antichrist  Kim Kardashian and Kanye West welcomed their first child into the world on June 15, 2013 - quite a bit earlier than her original due date.  This could have been down to Kim's pre-eclampsia, but that, for many people, was too logical a suggestion. Instead, they've decided it's because North West is the antichrist.  Yup, you read that right; the antichrist.  It has been suggested that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were desperate to have their child on 15th June, 2013.  That’s 15/6/2013 in numeric form.  Check it out: (1+5)=6, 6, 2+0+1+3=6Ergo, 6/15/2013 = 666 - the number of the devil.  SIGH - someone spent a lot of time trying to make those numbers work.  Poor little Nori, eh?  Tupac is alive and well and living in Cuba  Tupac tragically died on 13th September 1996, after being shot as he rode in a car driven by Death Row Records chairman ""Suge"" Knight near the Las Vegas strip in September 1996. But plenty of his fans refuse to believe it.  Why? Well, there's the fact he was cremated the day after his death - there's no body for fans to dig up and examine as 'proof.  The rest of their 'evidence' is pretty shady.  Apparently Tupac staged his own death and fled to Cuba to live out his years in peace with his godmother Assata Shakur.  Following an Eminem reference to Pac’s Cuban refuge and the addition of Pac’s godmother to the F.B.I.’s most wanted list, threads began to pop up on forums alluding that he would return from Cuba in 2014.  Plus there's the hologram performance, which some conspiracy theorists have decided was actually the real Tupac.  And there's all those 'sightings' of Tupac around the world, lurking in the backgrounds of photographs and videos.  Hmm. We're not convinced - are you?  Buddy Holly escaped the Bermuda Triangle  Buddy Holly is a bit of a mystery, mainly because his death is connected to the ultra-mysterious Bermuda Triangle.  Yup, we swear it; the singer’s plane disappeared somewhere over that eerie stretch of water - and now plenty of YouTubers have claimed he's alive and well and living in Ganamede.  Hmm. As long as his music continues to be played, he can live on wherever, surely?  John F. Kennedy was assassinated by the CIA  Everyone has a theory on who killed JFK but, for most, the idea that the CIA was behind the assassination of the president is just too… well, too hard to disprove.  First, the facts: On 22nd November 1963, President Kennedy was riding in a motorcade in Dallas, Texas, when he was shot and killed.  Roughly one hour later, Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for Kennedy's murder; however, Oswald was not in custody long before he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby.  Next, the conspiracy theory: Most theorists do not believe Oswald was responsible for Kennedy's murder, while those that do believe he had help - after all, he was firing an ancient rifle from VERY far away.  And hitting a small moving target from such a distance, in wind, would be difficult.  Footage of the event taken by Abraham Zapruder supported the growing belief that at least four shots were fired - not the three that the Warren Commission claimed. The moments of impact recorded on the film also suggested that at least one of the shots came from a completely different direction to those supposedly fired by Oswald - evidence backed up by testimony of several eye witnesses.  Many believed that several shots were fired by gunmen hiding behind a picket fence on a grassy knoll overlooking the plaza.  There is an enduring theory that the CIA, furious over rumours that JFK was about to ""splinter the CIA into a thousand peaces"", staged the assassination.  And, whether the shots were fired by the ""three tramps"" spotted at the scene of the crime, the agent who fired wildly in JFK's direction from the car behind or a lone sniper on the grassy knoll, it goes without saying that this is a theory that won't be going away any time soon.  Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Suri & Scientology  Speaking in her explosive new exposé “Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology”, Leah Remini has claimed that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes left their daughter Suri (at the time 7 months old) to cry on a bathroom floor at their wedding.  After five minutes of listening to Suri’s cries, Leah claims she went to check on the baby and found Cruise’s sister, his assistant and another woman staring at her as though she was ‘L Ron Hubbard incarnate’, a rebirth of the religion’s founder.  The actress claims that she finally convinced the women in the bathroom to pick up the crying baby and give her a bottle of warm milk.  The Church of Scientology, which released a response to Remini on its website, stated of her claims about the wedding: ""Every claim Ms. Remini has made is not only untrue, but ridiculous and stupid. She is just trying to latch onto a prominent celebrity for her own publicity.",fake
19570,"ROYAL aides are said to be concerned over the public outbursts of Meghan Markle’s dad, following a number of explosive TV interviews in recent months.  According to the Mirror in the UK, aides at the Palace have held at least three top-level crisis meetings on how to stop Thomas Markle upsetting his daughter.  It comes after the 74-year-old claimed the Duchess is “terrified” of her new royal role and, royal insiders say, “crossed the line” with his comments that Princess Diana would have “loathed” how he had been frozen out of the royal circle, reports The Sun.  The Mirror also claims that the matter has gotten so out of hand that royal sources say the only way to end the farce will be for the Queen to step in.  Sources suggest the talks have centred around three potential options to bring the situation to a close.  The first would be for Meghan to talk directly to her father via a phone call in a personal appeal for him to stop, and a second could be to arrange an intermediary meeting to appeal to him face-to-face.  A final scenario would be to cut him off, the Mirror has claimed.  Kensington Palace declined to comment on the claims.  The Daily Mail reported an unnamed friend of Meghan’s saying that a reconciliation is completely off the table.  “There’s no chance right now - he’s been a complete embarrassment,” the source said.  MORE: Thomas Markle speaks about former drug use.  MORE: Meghan’s kids will have surprising surname  The Palace crisis talks come just days after the Duchess’ dad confessed to taking drugs while his daughter Meghan was growing up.  Meghan’s outspoken father made the startling admission as he angrily denied having a drinking problem.  He said: “I don’t do drugs, haven’t for more than 20 years” while claiming he only has wine with dinner.  Mr Markle insisted that he doesn’t even drink beer despite being photographed with a six pack.  He said: “I regularly buy a six-pack for the guys on the guard gate because they’re stuck in a hot shack for hours each day and could use a cold one.”  A source close to the family added that Mr Markle used drugs to cope with the pressures of Hollywood while working as a lighting director.  They said that drug use was “part and parcel” of working in television where the hours were long.  While Mr Markle did not specify which drugs he used to take, his daughter Samantha said that marijuana was popular among his peers at the time.

1220,"Nelsan Ellis is dead. The actor, best known for starring on “True Blood” and “Elementary,” died at age 39. Now celebrities are reacting on Twitter and paying tribute to the late star. See tweets below.  Ellis’ death was announced on Saturday by his manager. Emily Gerson Saines said in a statement, “Nelsan has passed away after complications with heart failure. He was a great talent, and his words and presence will be forever missed.”  On “True Blood,” Ellis starred as Lafayette Reynolds. He held the regular role for the duration of the seven-season series, earning two Satellite Awards, an Entertainment Weekly honor, and a NewNowNext Award. He and the rest of the cast also garnered a SAG Award nomination. In 2016, he joined “Elementary” as Shinwell Johnson. His character was killed off on the May 7, 2017 episode.

13852,"Movement against sexual harrassment  Time's Up is a movement against sexual harassment and was founded on January 1, 2018, by Hollywood celebrities[2] in response to the Weinstein effect and #MeToo. As of December 2018 , it has raised more than $22 million for its legal defense fund, and gathered nearly 800 volunteer lawyers.[3]  History  In November 2017, the Alianza Nacional de Campesinas wrote a letter of solidarity to the Hollywood women involved in exposing the sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein. The letter, published in Time, described experiences of assault and harassment among female farmworkers. The letter stated that it was written on behalf of the approximately 700,000 female farmworkers in the United States.[4]  Partly in response, Time's Up was announced in The New York Times on January 1, 2018. The announcement cited the letter of support from the Alianza Nacional de Campesinas and the desire to support women, men, people of color, and the LGBT community who have less access to media platforms and funds to speak up about harassment.[1] At its founding, the following initiatives were announced:  A $13-million legal defense fund, administered by the National Women's Law Center, to support lower-income women seeking justice for sexual harassment and assault in the workplace  Advocating for legislation to punish companies that tolerate persistent harassment  A movement toward gender parity in studio and talent agencies  Calling for women and men on the red carpet at the 75th Golden Globe Awards to wear black and speak out about sexual harassment and assault.  Mark Wahlberg and William Morris Endeavor, his talent agency, donated more than $2 million to Time's Up in early January 2018 in the name of Wahlberg's co-star Michelle Williams from All the Money in the World. This occurred after it was revealed that Williams (who is represented by the same agency) received $800 for 10 days to redo certain scenes in the movie, while Wahlberg received $1.5 million for the same 10 days of work.[5]  Attendees of the 2018 Grammys including Lady Gaga, Lana Del Rey, Kesha and Cyndi Lauper wore white roses or all-black outfits to express solidarity with the Time's Up movement.[6] Lorde wore an excerpt from a work by Jenny Holzer, printed on a card stitched onto the back of her dress; the excerpt read, ""Rejoice! Our times are intolerable. Take courage, for the worst is a harbinger of the best. Only dire circumstance can precipitate the overthrow of oppressors. The old & corrupt must be laid to waste before the just can triumph. Contradiction will be heightened. The reckoning will be hastened by the staging of seed disturbances. The apocalypse will blossom.""[7][6] Lorde wrote, ""My version of a white rose — THE APOCALYPSE WILL BLOSSOM — an excerpt from the greatest of all time, Jenny Holzer.""[6]  At the 2018 Grammy's Kesha performed her song ""Praying"", while she stood in unity with fellow female songwriters/artists all wearing white to show their alliance in believing women, and that women will no longer be silenced.[8]  At the 2018 BAFTA Film Awards in London, attendees wore black and Time’s Up pins.[9]  In late 2018, Lisa Borders, former president of the WNBA and former Coca-Cola executive, was named the organization's first president and chief executive officer.[10] On February 18, 2019, she stepped down due to her son being accused of sexual misconduct.[11] Tina Tchen was named as chief executive in October of 2019.[12]  In January 2019, the organization launched its 4% challenge, asking production companies to show their commitment to working with a female director on a feature production in the next 18 months. Universal Pictures, MGM Studios, Paramount Pictures and Amazon Studios were among a number of prominent entertainment companies to pledge their support for the challenge.[13][14]  Founding signatories  On the website is an open letter to women of the world, standing in solidarity and affirming the signatories' action to tackle sexual harassment and assault. The letter was signed by almost 400 predominantly British and American women in the entertainment industry and the DMK cosmetics foundation.[15] Signatories include Shonda Rhimes and the actresses from her headliner ABC shows Grey's Anatomy and Scandal, including Jessica Capshaw as well as her mother, Kate Capshaw, who has individually spoken out with husband Steven Spielberg on the ""national and global problem"" that needs to be tackled ""as an imperative.""[16]  Legal defense fund  Lawyers Roberta Kaplan and Tina Tchen co-founded the Time’s Up legal defense fund, which had raised $22 million as of October 2018 to provide legal defense for sexual violence victims, especially those who experienced misconduct in the workplace.[17][18] It has access to over 780 attorneys. According to the National Women’s Law Center (NWLC) which administers the fund, about 40% of those requesting help are women of color and 65% of them are low-income, from industries like construction, food services, and the military.[18]  Website  The first thing listed on the Time's Up movement website is a statement that reads, ""The clock has run out on sexual assault, harassment, and inequality in the workplace. It's time to do something about it."" Under the statement is a letter of solidarity, donations to the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund are asked for and if donation is given, signing of the letter of solidarity is permitted. Located a little further down is some statistical information about sexual assault and harassment against women as well as inequalities in the work place. What follows is information about the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund which money raised from this fund will assist in covering legal and public relations expenses in some cases where individuals have experienced instances of sexual harassment or retaliation in the workplace relating to such issues. The Time's Up Legal Defense fund is administered by the National Women's Law Center which is a national women's rights legal organization. This organization connects sexual harassment victims with attorneys who can provide legal assistance. The last thing listed on the website is other resources such as BetterBrave, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and Equal Rights Advocates all of which are equipped to handle issues regarding sexual harassment or inequalities of women in the workplace.  Criticism  As a movement focused on combatting sexual harassment in the workplace across many industries,[19] the Time's Up movement has received external criticism from a variety of sources. These critiques largely focus on the hypocrisy of the movement and its spokespeople, as well as the general response of Hollywood elites. Many writers have criticized Hollywood for espousing the messages of the movement without making the necessary changes in the industry that the movement is calling for. During awards season, writers called out the industry for ""leaning hardest on the very women it has exploited"" in order to convert their critiques and testimonies into ""inspirational messages and digestible branding exercises"".[20] Others criticize the movement for a lack of diversity in its spokespeople. The majority of Time's Up representatives are notably wealthy and of celebrity status. Many progressive commentators criticize the movement for its entrenchment in celebrity culture. They claim celebrities are not committed to the cause beyond their superficial involvement in the Time's Up organization and that these (mostly) women do not represent the interests of women in real communities.[21]  As a movement intended to combat sexual harassment across many industries, critics fear that its focus on Hollywood detracts from other industries. As a counterpoint, many bring attention to the fact that the Movement allies itself with Alianza Nacional de Campesinas.[22] Additionally, many cite that Time's Up draws inspiration from the #MeToo movement, a campaign started and organized by activists of color like Tarana Burke. Similar critiques came to light during the Golden Globes in January 2018, when many actresses and signatories of the movement dressed in black brought prominent activists as their dates; for example, Burke arrived with Michelle Williams, and Meryl Streep brought Ai-jen Poo, director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance as her date. Other activists in attendance included Rosa Clemente, Saru Jayaraman, Billie Jean King, Marai Larasi, Calina Lawrence, and Mónica Ramírez, co-founder of Alianza Nacional de Campesinas.[23] Though many praised this choice as an opportunity to lend voices to prominent activists in the field, others heavily criticized these and other actresses for showcasing activists of color as moral accessories.[20] In an interview with Variety, however, Burke herself commented that once she received an invitation from Michelle Williams to attend the awards, she thought this choice was ""brilliant"".[24]",real

2634,"Photography via Getty  Have We Reached the End of Our 3,600 Word Jelena Timeline?  So. Much. Drama.  Every relationship has its ups and downs, but when we’re talking about Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, that’s approximately seven years of roller-coaster emotions.  The two sparked dating rumours in 2010 and captured the hearts of both their fan bases, resulting in the #Jelena hashtag. Since Bieber and Gomez are two of the most famous young stars of their time, their admirers range from supportive to downright obsessive.  Their relationship is kind of very hard to follow, but luckily, we’ve broken down every single one of their breakups and makeups. Grab a snack, because there’s a lot to dive into.  photography via instagram.com/jelena_firstofall  January 2011: Vacation in St. Lucia  Bieber/Gomez dating rumours began to circulate in 2010. But it wasn’t until January 2011 that the pop stars confirmed their romance, namely by partaking in major PDA while on vacation together in St. Lucia.  Photography by Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic  February 2011: Jelena steps out on red carpet at the Vanity Fair Oscars party  Yup, they finally made our dreams a reality by walking the red carpet together for the first time, thus confirming their young love. Aren’t they adorable?  photography by Kevin Mazur/Contributor/Getty  May 2011: Billboard Music Awards  Jelena looked happy and strong at the Billboard Music Awards. Oh, young love.  photography by steve granitz/contributor/getty  November 2011: Jelena is over… apparently  Rumours that Gomez has dumped the Canadian pop star begin to surface, after a Bieber fan claimed she had sex with him backstage at a show in October 2010, and that he is the father of her 4-month-old child. However, it’s confirmed that the breakup rumours aren’t true.  photography via pinterest  November 2012: The couple officially breaks up; Bieber briefly linked to model Barbara Palvin  Don’t go anywhere, this is just the first of many breakups. After more than a year of puppy love, the two reportedly split for the first time as a result of their jam-packed schedules. Fans (and the internet) also begin to wonder whether there’s a relationship brewing between JB and Victoria’s Secret model Barbara Palvin. Palvin took to Twitter, confirming that there was nothing going on between her and Bieber.  photography via instagram.com/ashilrd  January 2013: The pair are reportedly back together; Gomez travels to Norway to visit Bieber  They clearly can’t stay away from one another for long. Less than 3 months after the duo called it quits, Bieber posted the above image of them on his Instagram… and of course, promptly deleted it.  Photography by Kevin Mazur/WireImage  November 2014: Gomez performs at the American Music Awards  The singer took to the stage to perform her single, “The Heart Wants What It Wants.” Here’s the kicker: she confirmed the song was about Bieber. After a few more on-again off-again appearances in the media, the couple officially confirmed they’d split.  photography via instagram.com/mommyhaileybaldwin    December 2014: Bieber denies Hailey Baldwin dating rumours  Jelena, what? We’re now onto Jailey. Talks that Bieber is dating model Hailey Baldwin are at a high. However, JB denies these rumours, assuring fans that they are simply good friends (whatever that means).  photography via instagram.com/zedd  January 2015: Gomez and Zedd dating rumours begin  Shortly after the Jailey rumours came out, Gomez was seen getting close with DJ Zedd. This romance was not confirmed until later that year in September, when Gomez spoke with Elle for an interview.  photography via instagram.com/selenamylight  September 2015: Gomez opens up about Bieber in ELLE  Gomez discusses her past relationship with her fellow pop star and states that she will always support him.  photography via instagram.com/selgselgenator  November 2015: Bieber appears on The Ellen DeGeneres Show  In November 2015, JB stopped by Ellen, and while discussing his upcoming album Purpose, he revealed which songs were inspired by Selena—thanks for the intel, Biebs! The songs? Check out “What Do You Mean?” “Sorry” and “Mark My Words”.  photography via instagram.com/haileybaldwin  January 2016: Bieber and Baldwin hang out on New Year’s Eve  Was it not recently that JB confirmed that he and Baldwin were just good friends? Yes, but now things appear to have changed. The two celebs took their romance public on Instagram. However, it’s unclear how long the this romance lasted, as they’ve since broken up.  photography via instagram.com/sofiarichie  August 2016: Sofia Richie posts an Instagram of her and Bieber  Yes, Sofia Richie, daughter of Lionel Richie, and sister of Nicole Richie. Bieber and Richie both took to Instagram recently to post photos of their time in Japan. The comments on both their accounts proved one thing for sure: do not mess with Jelena fans.  Photography via Instagram.com/selenagomez  August 2016: Gomez posts a clip of her singing “Let Me Love You”  So, just when we thought the dust had settled between Jelena, this clip surfaced of Gomez singing DJ Snake’s “Let Me Love You,” which features the Biebs on vocals. An official cover has yet to be released; however, suspicions that it’s coming soon have been heightened as DJ Snake posted a longer version of Gomez’s cover on his Snapchat. I think we can all agree that it’s a little odd of Selena to chose to cover her ex’s song after feuding over his new boo Sofia. But hey, you do you, Selena!  photography via instagram.com/revivaltour  November 2016: Bieber allegedly visits Gomez in rehab  Gomez pulled out of her Revival Tour, in late August, due to complications caused by Lupus; mainly symptoms surrounding anxiety and panic. As a result, she checks in to rehab facility (feel better soon, Selena!). Rumours of Bieber visiting Gomez in rehab have started to circulate. Can somebody seriously loop us in, please?!  Photography by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images  January 2017: Gomez and The Weeknd spotted together  The 24-year-old songstress was spotted making out with Canadian singer The Weeknd in photographs released by TMZ. According to the celeb news site, Gomez and The Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) were “getting handsy and mouthy” outside Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Santa Monica, Calif. They then made it Instagram official (sort of) during a trip to Italy where the pair were spotted wining and dining (and kissing, duh!) in Venice and Florence.  Photography by Charley Gallay/AMA2015/Getty Images for dcp  February 2017: JB and The Weeknd begin to feud  While out in Los Angeles, Bieber was asked by paparazzi if he would listen The Weeknd’s music, to which he responded with a simple “Hell, no.” Fast forward to Valentine’s Day, when a track called “Some Way” by Toronto rapper Nav, featuring The Weeknd drops. “I think your girl / think your girl / fell in love with me,” the singer croons. The song also delves into NSFW territory: “She say my fuck and my tongue game a remedy.” Yikes! A day later, DJ Kygo’s single “It Ain’t Me” drops, featuring Gomez, and let’s just say the lyrics appear to allude to a certain former flame. Serious. Drama.  Photography via Instagram/_marissamarino  April 30, 2017: Selena reportedly pens a JB diss-track  The Sun reports that Gomez and singer/songwriter Charli XCX have collaborated on a track titled “Bad Girlfriend.” The British tabloid speculates that the song is about Justin Bieber, and states that a source has told them that it’s “…about a boyfriend the girl is no longer really into and has finally gotten wise to.” One of the alleged lines, according to The Sun is: “I know I’m not there for you or there when you call. I’m a bad girlfriend/I’m a bad girlfriend.” So. Much. Shade.  Photography via Instagram/selenagomez  May 2017: Selena promotes new single on Instagram  Last week, Gomez took to her Instagram to tease fans with news of her upcoming single. The singer posted a trio of highly-stylized (read: dark, moody) images featuring the words “Bad Liar” scrawled with lipstick on a mirror. As a result, many are speculating that the song must be about her (surprise!) infamous ex-boyfriend. What we can confirm is that the track is scheduled to drop May 18.  June 2017: Selena compliments Justin on a radio talk show.  During an interview on Sirius XM’s Morning Mash Up, ​Selena was asked ​to share ​her thoughts on Ariana Grande’s #OneLoveManchester benefit concert​. Turns out ​she had nothing but ​good things to say about the performers, including Justin.  “It was beautiful,” says Selena. “I thought everyone did such a beautiful job. It was so gorgeous. I love how she [Ariana] ended it. I thought Justin did great. It was really beautiful.” Cue the wild screams tweets from Jelena fans.  JELENA IS RISING AGAIN YOU GUYS pic.twitter.com/ea9zylAaSZ — shooters for krisdeana (@belizafucked) June 5, 2017  Photography by Kevin Mazur/WireImage  June 2017: A Selena and Justin duet reportedly leaked on Soundcloud  The two recorded an incomplete single called “Steal Our Love” back in 2013/2014 before their final breakup. While the song is no longer available to listen to (it was leaked and then swiftly taken off of Soundcloud), the Jelena fans over at Elle has kindly provided us the lyrics. And judging from the lines, the songs tells the story of two people in a troubled relationship who are fighting to make it work.  “I can’t seem to choose what to do / There’s nothing I can say / I’m tired of the fight ’cause I’m never right / I just wanna cry, no,” Selena allegedly sings.  Sounds familiar?  Photography via Instagram/@justinbieber  August 2017: Justin releases a new song titled “Friends”  “Can we still be friends?” Bieber asks on his latest track with Bloodpop. He’s singing to to an ex who he swears he’s over but can’t quite completely, and (obviously) fans assume he’s singing to Selena. The plot thickened when people started realizing that Julia Michaels, a good friend of Selena, co-wrote the single. Hmmm…could this be the start of a healthy post-romance friendship?  Photography via Twitter/@heardtroye  August 2017: Nude photos of Justin are posted to Selena’s Instagram  With 125 million followers, Selena Gomez is the most followed person on Instagram. So when hackers posted nude photos of her ex-bf to her account, a LOT of people noticed. When Selena’s team clued in, they swiftly took down her page to remove the NSFW photos and re-secure her account. Gomez’s Instagram was back online minutes later, with the nude pics deleted.  The explicit photos posted aren’t new: these are the same Bieber images that were published after the pop star’s Bora Bora vacation in 2015. Obviously, that doesn’t make it okay—we should never look a someone’s naked body without their consent.  October 2017: Justin and Selena spotted hanging out at Gomez’s home  Looks like Bieber’s song “Friends” really was about Selena! At the end of October, Justin was spotted at his ex-girlfriend’s home in California. According to TMZ, Jelena spent time with mutual friends, and Selena’s current boyfriend, The Weeknd, was fully aware of the hangout. TMZ also reports Justin and Selena first reconnected around the time Gomez announced she’d undergone a kidney transplant. All’s well that ends well!  October 2017: Justin and Selena go to church together  It was Sunday Funday for Jelena, with the former lovers spending the full day together on Oct. 29, 2017. According to TMZ, Justin and Selena first attended church service together before grabbing a bite to eat at Joi Cafe in Westlake Village, California. The exes reportedly left together, and Biebs showed up at Selena’s doorstep later that evening. A Sunday well spent brings a week of content!  October 2017: Selena is single, and Justin is THRILLED  Sound the alarms! According to a source via People, the “Sorry” singer is “happy Selena is single. He hopes to regain her trust so they can get back together.” According to Bieber’s “close friend”/wingman, “It seems their relationship now is very different. Justin is certainly a much better person. He would be a better boyfriend, too.” Maybe Justin’s song “Friends” wasn’t about Selena after all…  November 2017: Justin and Selena get pretty cozy  Well these two aren’t wasting any time are they? Jelena hung out in L.A. AGAIN the morning of November 1: They’re biking, they’re laughing, they’re nuzzling into one another, and it’s ALL going down in front of photographers. It’s not PDA, but it’s pretty close. All we need now is an Insta official pic from @justinbieber or @selenagomez.  November 2017: Selena wears Justin’s hockey jersey  Selena Gomez wearing Justin Bieber's hockey jersey is the Canadian equivalent of getting engaged, right? pic.twitter.com/Xr3SdQTSfq — Erica Steiner (@SendARavenPlz) November 2, 2017  Okay, so it’s not a PDA social media post — but it’s pretty close! Selena arrived at the LA Vallet Ice Centre in an all-black ensemble, and after cheering on her ex (?!) boo, left the building wearing Beiber’s New Jersey Devils hockey jersey. Isn’t the ‘borrowed-from-a-boy’ look the international indicator of love?  November 2017: Jelena is kissing in public again  Guess it’s not too late to say sorry for #SelenaGomez and #JustinBieber 💕 #Jelena A post shared by FASHION Magazine (@fashioncanada) on Nov 16, 2017 at 9:45am PST    This is the PDA confirmation we were waiting for! TMZ has shared photos that show the pop singers sealing the deal with a rink-side kiss at one of Justin’s hockey games. To all those who doubted Jelena: we told you so.  November 2017: Justin likes then unlikes a pic of Selena on Instagram  📱| Justin Bieber liked this photo of Selena on Instagram pic.twitter.com/gvo1ZnDKr4 — Selena Gomez Source (@GomezSource) November 20, 2017  Justin Bieber unliked https://t.co/vJbNYlFKRz — Selena Gomez Source (@GomezSource) November 20, 2017  Trouble in paradise already? Fans freaked out after they noticed Bieber liked a photo of Selena on Instagram, only to unlike it a few minutes later (“Their whole relationship in a nutshell,” remarked one clever Twitter user). Granted, the photo wasn’t actually posted on Gomez’s account but rather a fan account meaning Biebs (who currently doesn’t follow Selena, nor does she follow him) is resorting to exploring the ‘gram for pics of his lady.  In other news, the “Wolves” songstress quietly unfollowed ex-boyfriend The Weeknd on Instagram, and he later followed suit. And now we wait for the real indicator of the relationship status of Jelena: the duo hitting the “Follow” button on each others’ accounts. Stay tuned.  December 2017: Justin is asked if he’ll propose to Selena  Justin Bieber Smiles, Blushes When Asked If He'll Propose to Selena Gomez https://t.co/ad4u4sGJ3f — TMZ (@TMZ) December 6, 2017  In a video captured by TMZ , a paparazzi is heard asking Justin if he plans to get down on one knee to propose to Selena. The Biebs didn’t get a straight answer, but he did flash a wide grin and blush at the question as he got into his car. That’s something, right?  December 2017: Justin and Selena will spend Christmas apart  According to a recent report from People, Gomez’s family is less than supportive about her reunion with Bieber, and won’t be inviting him their family Christmas. “Justin’s family always loved Selena,” a source told the Magazine, “but Selena’s family is still not happy about her seeing Justin.” Selena, on the other hand, will always be welcome in Stratford, Ontario: “I’ve met her and we have a special bond, so I think she’s precious,” Beiber’s mom, Pattie Mallete, gushed to People over the weekend.  December 2017: Biebs and Selena share a drink at the Sugar Factory  They may not be spending *actual* Christmas together, but Justin and Selena are making sure to enjoy each other’s company pre-holiday festivities. According to TMZ, Jelena went on a date at the Sugar Factory, sharing a (non-alcoholic) drink called the Ocean Blue. How romantic!  Selena Gomez’s mom was reportedly hospitalized after a fight about Justin Bieber  Photography via Getty  Selena’s mom, Mandy Teefey, was voluntarily transported for treatment to a L.A. hospital last week after having a “heated” chat with Selena about her relationship with Justin, TMZ has reported. According to a source, Selena revealed to her mom that the on-again-off-again pair were in couples therapy, leading her to realize “the relationship was going to be more long-term.” The two later unfollowed each other on Instagram.  December 2017: Jelena reportedly in couples therapy because of a fight over Hailey Baldwin  The drama continues! TMZ reports Jelena is in Christian’s couples therapy after the pair had a fight over Justin’s ex, Hailey Baldwin. According to sources connected to Hillsong Church, Bieber has been trying to make amends with Baldwin to “clear the air over their brief relationship and sour breakup.” He informed Selena of the the convo, which didn’t go over too well, resulting in the pair going to therapy.  January 2018: Justin poses on Instagram with a tree  Trouble in paradise? While vacationing somewhere tropical, Justin posted a photo cuddling up to a palm tree with the caption, “Now I know what Love is.” Fans panicked: What does this mean? Did he not know what love was like when he was with Selena? Does he love the tree more than Selena? J-14 is convinced the caption is about his love for Jesus. (Interesting.)  February 2018: Jelena spotted making out amidst break-up rumours  just seen Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez cuddling in the middle of the street:))) — 🍑 (@hennessyysilvaa) February 9, 2018  Phew! No worries Jelena stans, the couple is going strong. When Bieber and Gomez attended the Rex Orange County show in Los Angeles, one fan got footage of what appears to be them cuddling in the street, while several others tweeted about seeing the two after the show. Here’s hoping the duo share their Valentine’s Day plans with the rest of us, and that they finally make things Insta-official?  February 2018: The pair indulge in a Laguna Beach Valentine’s staycation  Photography via Instagram/@TheJBCrewdotcom  With Gomez in New York for Fashion Week, it appears that the newly reunited couple won’t be spending Valentine’s Day together. But don’t fret Jelena stans! Because from the looks of things, Gomez and Bieber enjoyed a romantic staycation on the West Coast this past weekend in celebration of the holiday. TMZ reports that the duo were hanging poolside at the Montage hotel in Laguna Beach on Sunday, where they were spotted taking romantic beach walks and taking in the view.  February 2018: Jelena heads to Jamaica for a family wedding  Bieber and Gomez have landed in the Caribbean for a wedding — but don’t freak out yet, because it’s not their own. Justin’s dad Jeremy is tying the knot in Jamaica with longtime girlfriend Chelsey Rebelo, and the “Sorry” singer is bringing along Selena as his plus one. It’s a pretty big relationship step to take someone as a date to your parent’s destination wedding, right? These two are just as serious as we thought.  March 2018: Selena Gomez posts a b-day tribute to her boo  This is the moment we’ve been waiting for! It’s not the PDA-filled couple selfie we were hoping for, but at least it’s something! It’s sweet, subtle — and kind of meta? It’s a photo of a photo of Selena Gomez with a photo of Justin Bieber on her forehead. The caption: “March 1, 1994 someone I know that happens to be super cool was born. Boom.” Well said. There’s no better birthday gift than an Insta-official relationship.  March 2018: Sources say Jelena is taking time apart  Just six days after making their relationship Instagram official, rumours have started circulating that the on-again couple are taking a break. An unnamed source told E! that after spending so much time together in Jamaica, Gomez and Bieber “were having a lot of little disagreements recently and one fight in particular blew up and caused them to decide to ‘break up.’ However they’ve been in contact the entire time and their feelings for each other have not changed.”  But don’t worry too much Jelena shippers: “They will absolutely get back together and they are not over,” says the source, “but they both need some time away from each other.”  March 2018: Justin Bieber is spotted hanging out with another woman  Photography via Instagram/@floor8official  To cope with the break, Selena Gomez has taken off to Australia with her ukelele. Bieber has another approach to heartbreak: hang out with a beautiful blonde Sport’s Illustrated model. According to Entertainment Tonight, the mystery girl is Baskin Champion, younger sister to Abby Champion, actor Patrick Schwarzenegger’s GF. Champion and Bieber attended Craig David’s concert together in Los Angeles Tuesday night, where sources say Bieber had his “arm wrapped around her waist during one song, and she was spotted dancing up on him throughout the show.”  March 2018: Justin and Selena have reportedly called it quits — for good  Grab your tissue box: it looks like Jelena’s “break” has turned into a break-up. Reports say that Bieber is holding out for a reunion, but “Selena realized even though he’s made some positive improvements, they just aren’t a perfect match right now,” a source told E! News. The bad news gets worse, because the source also said that the two aren’t talking anymore (cue the Charlie Puth x Selena Gomez song.)  Fans think Gomez’s latest outfit — a pair of itty-bitty Daisy Dukes and a yellow t-shirt that read, “Never underestimate the power of a woman” — is hinting at the heartbreak. But hey, this could very well be message for all men!  April 2018: Sources say Justin wants Selena back  Not all hope is lost! According to a new report from People, Bieber desperately wants Gomez to take him back.“He loves her. He wants her back,” the source says, adding he “misses” Gomez. Can these two please just let us know what’s up? This seven year on-again-off-again drama is giving us serious whiplash.  May 2018: Selena has apparently “completely moved on”  Have we reached the end of our lover’s saga? Multiple sources have told E! News that Gomez is over Bieber and not interested in rekindling their romance any time soon. “She respects him as a person but has decided she is much happier doing her own thing.,” said one insider to E! Selena rarely even talks about Justin anymore, and is fully open to dating.” So, is this the conclusion of the on-again-off-again romance? Or has precedent shown us that this is just another bump in the road for these star crossed lovers?  June 2018: Justin and Hailey Baldwin are hanging out again  Ahhh another rekindled love! This past weekend, the once rumoured couple reunited for a few days of bikinis and bibles in Miami. They were photographed drying each other off by the pool, attending a church conference and snuggling on the VIP balcony of LIV Nightclub at Fontainebleau. You know, normal relationship stuff.  July 2018: Justin and Hailey get engaged  After just a month of dating, Bieber popped the big question to Baldwin at a resort in the Bahamas.“Everyone was at a restaurant on the property doing salsa dancing when Justin’s security told everyone to put their phones away,” two witnesses told TMZ, who broke the story early July 8, “because something special was about to happen.”  Have we finally reached the fateful end of our ongoing Jelena timeline? After seven years of drama, maybe it’s what’s best.",fake
1962,"These days, Scott Disick is enjoying his ""nympho"" girlfriend Sofia Richie and seems almost stable. But that wasn't always the case.  Like most reality television, Keeping Up With The Kardashians airs months after its filmed. So we're just now seeing Scott's 2017 meltdown drama.  Which means that, as you'll see in the video below, viewers are now treated to Scott freaking out over Kourtney's young, hot boyfriend.  It's no secret that Scott Disick doesn't like Kourtney Kardashian dating Younges Bendjima. He has made that very, very clear on various Keeping Up With The Kardashians clips.  But now we're gaining more insight into exactly how Scott uses his own bad behavior to act out for attention.  For Kourtney's attention.  Khloe summarizes the pattern at play pretty darn well:  ""So you told him you have a boyfriend, now he's doing this ‘cause he knows that every time he does that you come over there running.""  That's a very unhealthy pattern of behavior.  Kourtney says that it's really draining her: ""I just honestly don't have the energy.""  She continues her story, speaking to Khloe and to Kim.  ""So yeah I went to Scott's house because he called me and was really out of it.""  So ... is that code for ""drunk,"" or are we just guessing that because of how he spent so much of 2017?  Alarmingly, it sounds like Scott's freakout was enough to drive Kourtney away.  ""He was just very aggressive. And then I was like, ‘I'm leaving!'""  Weird that Scott had no problem banging his way through a bunch of hot models born in 1998, but the moment that he finds out that Kourtney's enjoying a model of a 1993 vintage, he starts to freak out.  Kourtney didn't appreciate that one bit.  ""And then I just started crying and I was like, ‘I do not need to even be here.'""  She's right. You do not need to babysit your ex just because his man feelings are hurt.  It sounds like Scott worried her enough that she had to instruct him.  ""And then I was like, ‘Just sit down!' Literally, you have talk to him like crazy, otherwise he won't listen.""  Like ... like a dog?  ""So I'm like, ‘Sit down across the room from me.""  She had some serious questions for him.  ""What the f--k is wrong with you? When is it going to be enough?""  Kourtney summarizes exactly why she doesn't need to be holding the hand of a man-child.  ""I have three kids to take care of.'""  Exactly. Her nurturing instincts don't need to be wasted on Scott.  Of course, like we said, this is from months ago. We know that this has a ""happy"" ending, since ... well, Scott ends up with Sofia Richie and we guess that the relationship serves as a balm for his insecurities.  Here's the video:",fake

For the British jazz, rock and house music singer, see Juliet Roberts  American actress and producer  Julia Fiona Roberts (born October 28, 1967)[1] is an American actress and producer. She established herself as a leading lady in Hollywood after headlining the romantic comedy film Pretty Woman (1990), which grossed $464 million worldwide. She has won three Golden Globe Awards, from eight nominations, and has been nominated for four Academy Awards for her film acting, winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Erin Brockovich (2000).  Her films have collectively brought box office receipts of over US$2.8 billion, making her one of the most bankable actresses in Hollywood.[2] Her most successful films include Mystic Pizza (1988), Steel Magnolias (1989), Pretty Woman (1990), Sleeping with the Enemy (1991), The Pelican Brief (1993), My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), Notting Hill (1999), Runaway Bride (1999), Erin Brockovich (2000), Ocean's Eleven (2001), Ocean's Twelve (2004), Charlie Wilson's War (2007), Valentine's Day (2010), Eat Pray Love (2010), Money Monster (2016), and Wonder (2017). Roberts was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for her performance in the HBO television film The Normal Heart (2014). In 2018, she starred in the Prime Video psychological thriller series Homecoming.  Roberts was the highest-paid actress in the world throughout most of the 1990s[3][4] and in the first half of the 2000s.[5] Her fee for 1990's Pretty Woman was US$300,000;[6] in 2003, she was paid an unprecedented $25 million for her role in Mona Lisa Smile (2003). As of 2017 , Roberts's net worth was estimated to be $170 million.[7] People magazine has named her the most beautiful woman in the world a record five times.[8]  Early life and family  Roberts was born on October 28, 1967, in Smyrna, Georgia,[1][9] to Betty Lou Bredemus (1934–2015) and Walter Grady Roberts (1933–1977).[1][9][10] She is of English, Scottish, Irish, Welsh, German, and Swedish descent.[11][12] Her father was a Baptist, her mother a Catholic,[13] and she was raised Catholic.[14][15] Her older brother Eric Roberts (b. 1956), from whom she was estranged for several years until 2004, older sister Lisa Roberts Gillan (b. 1965), and niece Emma Roberts, are also actors. She also had a younger half-sister named Nancy Motes (1976–2014).  Roberts' parents, one-time actors and playwrights, met while performing in theatrical productions for the armed forces. They later co-founded the Atlanta Actors and Writers Workshop in Atlanta, off Juniper Street in Midtown. They ran a children's acting school in Decatur, Georgia, while they were expecting Julia. The children of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King attended the school; Walter Roberts served as acting coach for their daughter, Yolanda Denise King.[16] As a thank-you for his service, Mrs. King paid Mrs. Roberts's hospital bill when Julia was born.[17]  Her parents married in 1955. Her mother filed for divorce in 1971; the divorce was finalized in early 1972.[18] From 1972, Roberts lived in Smyrna, Georgia, where she attended Fitzhugh Lee Elementary School, Griffin Middle School, and Campbell High School.[19] In 1972, her mother married Michael Motes, who was abusive and often unemployed; Roberts despised him.[20] The couple had Nancy, who died at 37 on February 9, 2014, of an apparent drug overdose.[21] The marriage ended in 1983, with Betty Lou divorcing Motes on cruelty grounds; she had stated that marrying him was the biggest mistake of her life.[20] Roberts's own father died of cancer when she was ten.[22]  Roberts wanted to be a veterinarian as a child.[23] She also played the clarinet in her school band.[24][25] After graduating from Smyrna's Campbell High School, she attended Georgia State University but did not graduate. She later headed to New York City to pursue a career in acting. Once there, she signed with the Click Modeling Agency and enrolled in acting classes.[26][27]  Acting career  1980s  Roberts made her first big screen appearance in the film Satisfaction (1988), alongside Liam Neeson and Justine Bateman, as a band member looking for a summer gig. She had previously performed a small role opposite her brother Eric, in Blood Red (she has two words of dialogue), filmed in 1987, although it was not released until 1989. Her first television appearance was as a juvenile rape victim in the initial season of the series Crime Story with Dennis Farina, in the episode titled ""The Survivor"", broadcast on February 13, 1987. Her first critical success with moviegoers was her performance in the independent film Mystic Pizza in 1988;[28] that same year, she had a role in the fourth-season finale of Miami Vice. In 1989, she was featured in Steel Magnolias, as a young bride with diabetes, and received both her first Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actress) and first Golden Globe Award win (Motion Picture Best Supporting Actress) for her performance.[28]  1990s  Roberts became known to worldwide audiences when she starred with Richard Gere in the Cinderella–Pygmalionesque story, Pretty Woman, in 1990, playing an assertive freelance hooker with a heart of gold.[28] Roberts won the role after Michelle Pfeiffer, Molly Ringwald, Meg Ryan, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Karen Allen, and Daryl Hannah (her co-star in Steel Magnolias) turned it down.[29] The role also earned her a second Oscar nomination, this time as Best Actress, and second Golden Globe Award win, as Motion Picture Best Actress (Musical or Comedy).[28] Pretty Woman saw the highest number of ticket sales in the U.S. ever for a romantic comedy,[30] and made US$463.4 million worldwide.[31]  Roberts starred as one of five students conducting clandestine experiments that produce near-death experiences in the supernatural thriller Flatliners, in 1990. Her next film was the commercially successful thriller Sleeping with the Enemy (1991), in which she took on the role of a battered wife who escapes her abusive husband, played by Patrick Bergin, and begins a new life in Iowa. Roberts played Tinkerbell in Steven Spielberg's Hook, and starred as a nurse in Joel Schumacher's romance film Dying Young; both films were also released in 1991, to a highly positive commercial response.[32][33]  Roberts took a two-year hiatus from the screen, during which she made no films other than a cameo appearance in Robert Altman's The Player (1992). In early 1993, she was the subject of a People magazine cover story asking, ""What Happened to Julia Roberts?"".[34] Roberts starred with Denzel Washington in the thriller The Pelican Brief (1993), based on John Grisham's 1992 novel of the same name.[28] In it, she played a young law student who uncovers a conspiracy, putting herself and others in danger. The film was a commercial success, grossing US$195.2 million worldwide.[35][36] None of her next film releases – I Love Trouble (1994), Prêt-à-Porter (1994) and Something to Talk About (1995) – were particularly well-received by critics.[37][38][39] In 1996, she guest-starred in the second season of Friends (episode 13, ""The One After the Superbowl""),[40] and appeared with Liam Neeson in the historical drama Michael Collins,[28] portraying Kitty Kiernan, the fiancée of the assassinated Irish revolutionary leader. Stephen Frears' Mary Reilly, her other 1996 film, was a critical and commercial failure.[41][42]  By the late 1990s, Roberts enjoyed renewed success in the romantic comedy genre. In My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), she starred opposite Dermot Mulroney, Cameron Diaz and Rupert Everett, as a food critic who realizes she's in love with her best friend and tries to win him back after he decides to marry someone else. The film was a global box-office hit[43] and is considered to be one of the best romantic comedy films of all time.[44][45] In 1998, Roberts appeared on Sesame Street opposite the character Elmo, and starred in the drama Stepmom, alongside Susan Sarandon,[46] revolving around the complicated relationship between a terminally-ill mother and the future stepmother of her children. While reviews were mixed,[46] the film made US$159.7 million worldwide.[47]  Roberts paired with Hugh Grant for Notting Hill (1999), portraying a famous actress falling in love with a struggling book store owner. The film displaced Four Weddings and a Funeral as the biggest British hit in the history of cinema, with earnings equalling US$363 million worldwide.[48] An exemplary of modern romantic comedies in mainstream culture, the film was also received well by critics. CNN reviewer Paul Clinton called Roberts ""the queen of the romantic comedy [whose] reign continues"", and remarked: ""Notting Hill stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds.""[49] She reunited with Richard Gere and Garry Marshall, both of Pretty Woman, to play a woman who has left a string of fiancés at the altar in Runaway Bride, also released in 1999. Runaway Bride received generally mixed reviews from critics,[50][51][52][53] but it did very well at the box office, grossing US$309.4 million around the globe.[54] Roberts was a guest star on the episode ""Empire"", of the television series Law & Order, with regular cast member Benjamin Bratt (at that time her boyfriend). She earned a nomination for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.[55]  2000s  In 2000, Roberts portrayed real-life environmental activist Erin Brockovich in her fight against the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) of California in the film Erin Brockovich, for which she received US$20 million;[56] Rolling Stone magazine's Peter Travers wrote, ""Roberts shows the emotional toll on Erin as she tries to stay responsible to her children and to a job that has provided her with a first taste of self-esteem"",[57] while Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman felt that it was a ""delight to watch Roberts, with her flirtatious sparkle and undertow of melancholy"".[58] Erin Brockovich made US$256.3 million worldwide,[59] and Roberts won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role. In December 2000, Roberts, who had been the highest-paid actress through the 1990s, became the first actress to make The Hollywood Reporter's list of the 50 most influential women in show business since the list had begun in 1992.[3]  Roberts' first film following Erin Brockovich was the road gangster comedy, The Mexican (2001), giving her a chance to work with long-time friend Brad Pitt. The film's script was originally intended to be filmed as an independent production without major motion picture stars, but Roberts and Pitt, who had for some time been looking for a project they could do together, learned about it and decided to sign on. Though advertised as a typical romantic comedy star vehicle, the film does not focus solely on the Pitt/Roberts relationship and the two shared relatively little screen time together. The Mexican earned $66.8 million at the U.S. box office.[60]  Her next film, the romantic comedy America's Sweethearts (also 2001), starred Roberts along with Billy Crystal, John Cusack, and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Joe Roth, the Hollywood farce centers on a supercouple, Gwen and Eddie, who separate when she dumps him for another man. Roberts portrayed Gwen's once-overweight sister and assistant who has been secretly in love with Eddie (Cusack) for years. Reviews of the film were generally unfavorable: critics' felt that despite its famous cast, the movie lacked ""sympathetic characters"" and was ""only funny in spurts.""[61] A commercial success, it grossed over US$138 million worldwide, however.[62]  In fall 2001, Roberts teamed with Erin Brockovich director Steven Soderbergh for Ocean's Eleven, a comedy-crime caper film and remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film of the same name, featuring an ensemble cast including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon. Roberts played Tess Ocean, the ex-wife of leader Danny Ocean (Clooney), originally played by Angie Dickinson, who is dating a casino owner played by Andy García. A success with critics and at the box office alike, Ocean's Eleven became the fifth highest-grossing film of the year with a total of US$450 million worldwide.[63]  In 2003, Roberts was cast in Mike Newell's drama film Mona Lisa Smile, also starring Kirsten Dunst, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Julia Stiles. Roberts received a record US$25 million for her portrayal of a forward-thinking art history professor at Wellesley College in 1953 – the highest ever earned by an actress until then.[64] The film garnered largely lukewarm reviews by critics, who found it ""predictable and safe"".[65]  Eat Pray Love, September 2010 Roberts in Paris promoting, September 2010  In 2004, Roberts replaced Cate Blanchett in Mike Nichols's Closer, a romantic drama film written by Patrick Marber, based on his award-winning 1997 play of the same name.[66] The film also starred Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen.[66] Also in 2004, she reprised the role of Tess Ocean in the sequel Ocean's Twelve. The film was deliberately much more unconventional than the first, epitomized by a sequence in which Roberts' character impersonates the real-life Julia Roberts, due to what the film's characters believe is their strong resemblance.[67] Though less well reviewed than Eleven, the film became another major success at the box office, with a gross of US$363 million worldwide, mostly from its international run.[68] Unlike all the male cast members, Roberts did not appear in the series' third and final installment, Ocean's Thirteen (2007), due to script issues.[69] In 2005, she was featured in the music video for the single ""Dreamgirl"" by the Dave Matthews Band; it was her first music video appearance.[70] Roberts appeared in The Hollywood Reporter's list of the 10 highest-paid actresses every year from 2002 (when the magazine began compiling its list) to 2005.[5]  Besides providing her voice for roles in the 2006 animated films The Ant Bully and Charlotte's Web,[71][72] Roberts made her Broadway debut on April 19, 2006, as Nan in a revival of Richard Greenberg's 1997 play Three Days of Rain opposite Bradley Cooper and Paul Rudd. Although the play grossed nearly US$1 million in ticket sales during its first week[73] and was a commercial success throughout its limited run, her performance drew criticism. Ben Brantley of The New York Times described Roberts as being fraught with ""self-consciousness (especially in the first act) [and] only glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays.""[74] Brantley also criticized the overall production, writing that ""it's almost impossible to discern its artistic virtues from this wooden and splintered interpretation, directed by Joe Mantello.""[74] Writing in the New York Post, Clive Barnes declared, ""Hated the play. To be sadly honest, even hated her. At least I liked the rain—even if three days of it can seem an eternity.""[75]  Her next film was Charlie Wilson's War, with Tom Hanks and Philip Seymour Hoffman, directed by Mike Nichols; Roberts played socialite Joanne Herring, the love interest of Democratic Texas Congressman Charles Wilson. It was released on December 21, 2007,[76] to critical acclaim,[77] with Roberts eventually earning her sixth Golden Globe nomination.[78] Fireflies in the Garden, an independent drama in which Roberts played a mother whose death sets the story in motion, also starred Ryan Reynolds and Willem Dafoe; the film was screened at the 2008 Berlin International Film Festival and was subsequently shown in European cinemas—it did not get a North American release until 2011.[79] In 2009, Roberts starred with Clive Owen in the moderately successful comic thriller Duplicity, playing a CIA agent collaborating with another spy to carry out a complicated con.[80] For her performance, she received her seventh Golden Globe nomination. Also in 2009, Lancôme announced that Roberts would become their global ambassador for their company.[81]  2010s  In 2010, Roberts played an U.S. Army captain on a one-day leave, as part of a large ensemble cast, in the romantic comedy Valentine's Day, and starred as an author finding herself following a divorce in the film adaptation of Eat Pray Love. While she received US$3 million up front against 3 percent of the gross for her six-minute role in Valentine's Day,[82] Eat Pray Love had the highest debut at the box office for Roberts in a top-billed role since America's Sweethearts.[83][84] Later in the year, she signed a five-year extension with Lancôme for US$50 million.[85]  In 2011, she appeared as a college teacher and the love interest of a middle-aged man returning to education in the romantic comedy Larry Crowne, opposite Tom Hanks, who directed and played the title role.[86] The movie received generally mediocre reviews with only 35% of the 175 Rotten Tomatoes reviews giving it high ratings,[87] although Roberts's comedic performance was praised.[88] In Mirror Mirror (2012), the Tarsem Singh adaptation of Snow White, Roberts portrayed Queen Clementianna, Snow White's evil stepmother, opposite Lily Collins.[89]  In 2013, Roberts starred alongside Meryl Streep and Ewan McGregor in the black comedy drama August: Osage County, about a dysfunctional family that re-unites into the familial house when their patriarch suddenly disappears.[90] Her performance earned her nominations for the Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Critics' Choice Award, and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, amongst other accolades.[91][92][93][94] It was her fourth Academy Award nomination.[95]  In 2014, Roberts starred as Dr. Emma Brookner, a character based on Dr. Linda Laubenstein,[96][97] in the television adaptation of Larry Kramer's AIDS-era play, The Normal Heart, which aired on HBO; the film was critically acclaimed and Vanity Fair, in its review, wrote: ""Roberts, meanwhile, hums with righteous, Erin Brokovich-ian anger. Between this and August: Osage County, she's carving out a nice new niche for herself, playing brittle women who show their love and concern through explosive temper"".[98] Her role garnered her a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie.[99] She also narrated ""Women in Hollywood"", an episode of the second season of Makers: Women Who Make America, in 2014.[100] In 2015, Roberts appeared in Givenchy's spring–summer campaign,[101][102] and starred as a grieving mother opposite Nicole Kidman and Chiwetel Ejiofor in the little-seen film Secret in Their Eyes, a remake of the 2009 Argentine film of the same name, both based on the novel La pregunta de sus ojos by author Eduardo Sacheri.[103]  In 2016, she reunited with Garry Marshall again to appear as an accomplished author who gave her child for adoption in the romantic comedy Mother's Day, opposite Jennifer Aniston, Kate Hudson, Jason Sudeikis, and Timothy Olyphant. The film received ""overwhelmingly negative reviews"", but budgeted at US$25 million, was a moderate box office success, grossing US$48.5 million.[104] She also starred as a television director in the thriller Money Monster, directed by Jodie Foster and alongside George Clooney and Jack O'Connell.[105][106][107]  In Wonder (2017), the film adaptation of the 2012 novel of the same name by R. J. Palacio, Roberts played the mother of a boy with Treacher Collins syndrome.[108] The Times felt Roberts ""lifts every one of her scenes in Wonder to near-sublime places"",[109] as part of a positive reception,[110] and with a worldwide gross of US$305.9 million, Wonder emerged as one of Roberts' most widely seen films.[111][111] Roberts took on the role of a caseworker at a secret government facility in her first television series, Homecoming, which premiered on November 2, 2018 on Amazon Video.[112]  Film production  Roberts runs the production company Red Om Films (Red Om is ""Moder"" spelled backwards, after her husband's last name[113]) with her sister, Lisa Roberts Gillan, and Marisa Yeres Gill.[114] Through Red Om, Roberts served as an executive producer of the first four films of the American Girl film series (based on the American Girl line of dolls), released between 2004 and 2008.[115]  Personal life  Roberts in 2002  Relationships and marriages  Roberts had romantic relationships with actors Jason Patric, Liam Neeson, Kiefer Sutherland, Dylan McDermott, and Matthew Perry.[116][117] She was briefly engaged to Sutherland; they broke up three days before their scheduled wedding on June 11, 1991.[118] On June 25, 1993, she married country singer Lyle Lovett; the wedding took place at St. James Lutheran Church in Marion, Indiana.[119] They separated in March 1995 and subsequently divorced.[120] From 1998 to 2001, Roberts dated actor Benjamin Bratt.[121]  Roberts and her husband, cameraman Daniel Moder, met on the set of her film The Mexican in 2000 while she was still dating Bratt. At the time, Moder was married to Vera Steimberg. He filed for divorce a little over a year later, and after it was finalized, he and Roberts wed on July 4, 2002,[122] at her ranch in Taos, New Mexico.[123] Together, they have three children: twins, a daughter and a son, born in November 2004,[124] and another son born in June 2007.[125]  Religious beliefs  In 2010, Roberts said she was Hindu.[126] Roberts is a devotee of the guru Neem Karoli Baba (Maharaj-ji), a picture of whom drew Roberts to Hinduism.[127]  In September 2009, Swami Daram Dev of Ashram Hari Mandir in Pataudi, where Roberts was shooting Eat Pray Love, gave her children new names after Hindu gods: Laxmi for Hazel, Ganesh for Phinnaeus and Krishna Balram for Henry.[128]  Philanthropy  Roberts has given her time and resources to UNICEF as well as to other charitable organizations. On May 10, 1995, Roberts arrived in Port-au-Prince, as she said, ""to educate myself.""[129][130] The poverty she found was overwhelming. ""My heart is just bursting,"" she said.[129] UNICEF officials hoped that her six-day visit would trigger an outburst of giving: US$10 million in aid was sought at the time.[129][130]  In 2000, Roberts narrated Silent Angels, a documentary about Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder.[131] The documentary was designed to help raise public awareness about the disease. In July 2006, Roberts became a spokeswoman for Earth Biofuels, as well as chair of the company's newly formed Advisory Board promoting the use of renewable fuels.[132] She supported Gucci's ""Chime For Change"" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment.[133]  Roberts was the voice of Mother Nature in a 2014 short film for Conservation International, intended to raise awareness about climate change.[134]  Awards and nominations  Filmography  References",fake

Marion Cotillard, the French actress and Dior ambassador known for her demure and ladylike style, showed off a new, um, look on Instagram on Monday — complete with a dark wavy wig and full pout — that had us wondering if she had found a long-lost Kardashian kousin.  It was the 41-year-old's plump lips (which she noted were for her role in the film, Rock'n Roll, which was released last month in France) that had her fans buzzing, with many drawing comparisons to Kylie Jenner's infamous pout, as well as the full puckers of Rose McGowan and Angelina Jolie.  However, though Cotillard made it clear that the get-up was for a role, and not a personal choice, she appeared to be feeling it.  A post shared by @marioncotillard on Mar 6, 2017 at 3:05pm PST  The actress posted — count 'em — 18 selfies to give her fans a glimpse of every possible angle of the look, including several which showed off her cleavage. Cotillard, who is expecting a baby with partner Guillaume Canet (who also directed Rock'n Roll), utilized Instagram's new photo gallery feature so as not to flood fans' feeds.

The 42-year-old star is said acting like she was the star of the show and it causes the situation awkward with her other co-stars. ""I could tell Reese thinks she wears the pants,"" says a so-called insider. ""There's definitely a power struggle between them.""  Recently, Witherspoon and Streep along with their co-stars Nicole Kidman, Zoe Kravitz and Laura Dern were seen having dinner together. The eyewitness says Reese was ""really unfriendly"" to everyone at the table during the dinner outing.  The news about the alleged tension between Witherspoon and Streep is a bit bizarre though, as the former previously expressed her excitement to have the three-time Academy Award-winning actress starring on ""Big Little Lies"".  ""I called Nicole and I was like, 'Is this real life? Is this really happening?' And then I got off the phone with Nicole and I, like, hugged myself gently for a minute,"" she said on ""Late Night with Seth Meyers"". ""And said, 'This is really happening. You're really working with Meryl Streep.' ""  Witherspoon reprises her role as Madeline Martha Mackenzie, while Streep is tapped to portray Mary Louise Wright, Celeste's (Kidman) mother-in-law and the mother of Celeste's abusive husband, Perry Wright (Alexander Skarsgard), who was presumed dead in the first season.  Shailene Woodley is back as Jane Chapman, Laura Dern returns as Renata Klein and Zoe Kravitz still portrays Bonnie Carlson. Adam Scott is also set to reprise his role as Ed Mackenzie, Madeline's husband.  In the upcoming second season of the Emmy-winning series, Madeline is said to be confronting the truth of Perry's death and coming to terms with her own marriage and traditional notions of marriage. Meanwhile, Celeste is still reeling from her husband's death, ""adrift, but determined to fight for her family and find the woman she once was.""  The 7-episode season 2 of ""Big Little Lies"" reportedly will arrive in 2019.",fake

1702,"Kris Jenner is proud of all of daughters, but is she playing favorites with cosmetics mogul Kylie? We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how Khloe Kardashian is feeling jealous that Ky is her mom’s new golden child!  It’s a pretty impressive feat to build a cosmetics empire by the age of 20, and Kylie Jenner has done just that as her lip kit brand has sold $420 million worth of product in just a year and a half! The news was heralded on the cover of our sister publication Women’s Wear Daily on Aug. 9, along with a cover photo showing Ky and her proud mama Kris Jenner, 61. That caused Khloe Kardashian, 33, to remark that, “We are dead to her now,” referring to her other siblings. “Khloe was joking when she made that comment, but underneath it there’s definitely some truth to her feelings. There has always been competition between the girls for their mom’s attention,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  “She only has so much to go around and there are times Kris does play favorites, or at least it seems that way to Khloe,” our insider continues. The incredibly business-savvy momager has helped all of her kids with their ventures, and it turns out Kylizzle hit the jackpot with the perfect product for her fans. That has the Good American jeans founder feeling a little competitive that her sister just turned 20 on Aug. 10 and is already nearly halfway to being a billionaire! Click here for pics of Kylie and Khloe’s plumped pouts.  “She’s super proud of Kylie, but she does worry that she’s her mom’s favorite now. It’s hard to see her little sister build this empire so quickly, and get so much praise from her mom. Khloe wants to be a mogul too and she’s doing great with Good American, but the numbers don’t lie. It’s Kylie that’s really killing it right now. And success is what Kris celebrates, so it’s not hard to see why Khloe would be feeling a little envious,” our source adds.  The magazine declared that if sales continue at their current pace, “Kylie Cosmetics, wholly conceptualized, founded and helmed by Kylie (with some help from mastermind and mom Kris Jenner) is on track to become beauty’s next billion-dollar baby by 2022.” WOW! No wonder mama Kris is giving Ky’s business so much more attention than her other daughters’ ventures these days.  HollywoodLifers, do you think Kylie will be the first daughter in the family to be worth a billion dollars?",fake
996,"Last year, Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter pulled within a hair of beating out Diddy as the wealthiest man in hip-hop. The rapper’s net worth amounted to $810 million, according to Forbes—just $10 million short of Diddy’s total worth.  But with a series of massive business contracts, lofty real estate purchases and a successful album release and tour, 2018 may be the year Jay-Z’s net worth makes him the king of hip-hop.  Here are all the ways Jay-Z has made, and is currently making, his money.  Jay-Z Albums  Albums aren’t really the way musicians make money nowadays—but Jay-Z started out as an entertainer, and his music is what put him on the map and paved the way for his future success. He’s been making music since the mid-1990s, and has racked up 14 No. 1 albums, according to Billboard—including his latest, last year’s 4:44, which included the songs Smile (which won him a GLAAD nomination) and Family Feud.  His best-selling album is 1998’s Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life, Billboard reports, but other winners have included The Blueprint (volumes 1, 2, and 3), The Black Album, and Magna Carta … Holy Grail.  Live Nation Contract and Concerts  JAY-Z performs at Honda Center on Oct. 27, 2017 in Anaheim, Calif. Timothy Norris—Getty Images for ABA Timothy Norris—Getty Images for ABA  Last May, Jay-Z inked a deal worth a whopping $200 million over 10 years with entertainment conglomerate Live Nation Entertainment. The deal appears to have focused on live music and touring. Jay-Z’s 4:44 Tour concerts in November and December grossed a total of $48.7 million, according to Billboard, amounting to about $1.5 million per show.  His two previous tours, the Magna Carta Tour (in 2013-2014) and the Blueprint 3 Tour (2009-2010), grossed 37.4 million and $33.1 million in ticket sales, respectively, Billboard estimates.  Roc-A-Fella Records  Jay-Z’s knack for business first took off when he founded Roc-A-Fella Records with fellow East Coast rappers Damon Dash and Kareem “Biggs” Burke in 1994, according to MTV News.  Roc-A-Fella began as an independent label for Carter, Dash and Burke after they’d been snubbed by established labels, but grew into a powerhouse that released most of Jay-Z’s critically acclaimed albums, and gave artists like Cam’ron and Kanye West their launch pad.  In 1997, Carter, Dash and Burke sold half of Roc-A-Fella to Def Jam Recordings, one of the most prominent record labels in hip hop, for $1.5 million. Def Jam later bought the rest of Roc-A-Fella in 2004 for an additional $10 million. Jay-Z took over as president of Def Jam Recordings in 2004 for three years, and later created another successful entertainment label, Roc Nation.  Roc Nation Sports  Jay-Z isn’t just a master at cultivating musical talent.  Shortly after forming Roc Nation, Jay-Z launched a sports management division of the company in a joint project with L.A.-based talent agency Creative Artists Agency. Roc Nation Sports boasts some of the country’s most well known athletes, with a roster that includes Kevin Durant, Dez Bryant, Leonard Fournette and Robinson Canó.  Roc Nation Sports is Jay-Z’s second foray into the sports business: He previously owned a small stake in the Brooklyn Nets, helping the team orchestrate their move from New Jersey to Brooklyn. But in 2013 Jay-Z sold his share for $500,000. He reportedly was to get an additional $1.5 million from selling his stake in the Barclays Center—the Brooklyn arena that opened in 2012 and is home to the Nets—shortly after, according to Forbes.  Tidal  Usher, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Madonna, Dead Mouse, Kanye West, Jay Z, Jason Aldean, Jack White, Daft Punk, Beyonce and Win Butler attend the Tidal launch event on March 30, 2015 in New York City. Kevin Mazur—Getty Images Kevin Mazur—Getty Images  Jay-Z’s current big music venture is the streaming service Tidal, which he co-owns with two-dozen other artists. Back in 2015, Jay-Z spent $56 million to buy the Swedish company that first launched Tidal. Artists like Rihanna and Beyoncé (Jay-Z’s wife) have launched music exclusively on Tidal.  The rapper-turned-businessman said he went into streaming to create a platform that makes sure artists get compensated. Spotify has come under pressure from artists in the past for not paying enough royalties; a report from The Verge found some musicians get just 15% to 20% of streaming revenue, and the average “per stream” payout is somewhere between $0.006 to $0.0084.  “I’m just saying the producers and people who work on music are getting left out—that’s when it starts getting criminal,” Jay-Z said in an interview with Billboard at the time he bought Tidal. “It’s like you’re working hard and you’re not receiving.”  Despite a rocky start, Tidal sold a 33% stake to Sprint in early 2017 for $200 million, CNN reported—a deal that valued the company at $600 million. As part of the deal, Sprint users get free access to Tidal for a limited time.  Jay-Z and Beyoncé Marriage  Of course, Jay-Z is not the only money maker in his family. Beyoncé has both a pop track record and a fortune of her own—indeed, Forbes puts Beyoncé’s net worth at $350 million.  The two have also worked together over the years, collaborating on tracks such as Drunk in Love and Family Feud.  Other Ventures  As if Jay-Z weren’t busy enough, he has several other business projects and partnerships that have helped build his total net worth and cement his status as a mogul.  • Clothing  Jay-Z launched the clothing line Rocawear with Dash in 1999, and at one point had annual sales of over $700 million. However, personal issues between the company’s founders eventually led to its 2007 sale to Iconix Brand Group for $204 million in cash. There have also been recent reports that Jay-Z would be launching a new clothing line, apparently to be called AKA Shawn Carter.  • Bar/Restaurant  Jay-Z opened 40/40 Club, a high-end sports bar and restaurant in New York City, in 2003. Since then, he has expanded the club to add two other locations, one in Brooklyn and another in Atlanta.  Jay-Z made massive renovations to the flagship restaurant in NYC a few years back, reopening it in January 2012 with a party attended by Warren Buffett and Spike Lee.  • Champagne  Jay-Z bought the luxury French champagne brand Armand de Brignac for an undisclosed amount in 2014. While it’s not clear how much money the brand generates for him, its bottles have retailed for as much as $200,000, according to the New York Times; a more recently released bottle is priced at $850.  • JetSmarter  The mogul also invested $20 million in 2015 in JetSmarter, an app that brands itself as an “Uber for private jets.” JetSmarter clients pay $9,000 a year for unlimited access to private flights anywhere in the world.  Real Estate  File this not under how they make their money, but how they spend it: Jay-Z and Beyoncé topped the L.A. Times’ list of most expensive home sales last year, purchasing a Bel-Air mansion for $90 million after their family got a bit bigger with the birth of their twins, Rumi and Sir. Jay-Z’s house is about 30,000 square feet and includes spa facilities, a media room and four outdoor swimming pools.  The couple also bought a $26 million Hamptons mansion last September, located on Georgica Pond. Trulia also reports that Jay and Beyoncé have homes in New Orleans and Manhattan’s Tribeca neighborhood.",fake
17259,"Jimmy Kimmel Live (TV Show) type TV Show network ABC genre Talk Show Where to watch Close Streaming Options  With Scandal coming to an end, the cast needed to take care of some unfinished business with Josh Malina.  The actor has spent years pranking his fellow actors during production on the hit Shondaland drama — so much so that he made Darby Stanchfield cry at one point. But with much of their attention focused on the finale, Jimmy Kimmel swooped in as an avenging angel to turn the tables on their costar.  With help from Scandal actor Katie Lowes, Kimmel set the stage for a grand prank. Malina was expecting to surprise an unsuspecting family watching the show together at home, but when he fired off a small confetti canon in their living room, the actor pretending to be the grandmother faked a heart problem.  Malina began to panic as Lowes came to her aid and the producers called an ambulance. Meanwhile, Scandal creator Shonda Rhimes and the rest of the series cast cracked up watching pre-recorded footage of the prank from the Jimmy Kimmel Live stage on Thursday night.  “I’m sorry to scare you. I’m so sorry. We’re here for you. Breathe,” Malina said as he grabbed the fake grandma’s hand and she started to cry.  It wasn’t until Kimmel emerged as an EMT that Malina realized this whole thing was staged. “That is the worst thing anyone has ever done to me,” the actor laughed.  Malina did get one more surprise as he left to face Kimmel’s cameras, and that was a firefighter spraying him with a hose.  “I can’t say I didn’t have it coming,” he said.",real
1905,"Wife of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge  Duchess of Cambridge (more)  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, (born Catherine Elizabeth Middleton; 9 January 1982), previously known as Kate Middleton,[1] is a member of the British royal family. Her husband, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is expected to become king of the United Kingdom and 15 other Commonwealth realms, making Catherine a likely future queen consort.[2]  Catherine grew up in the village of Chapel Row, part of Bucklebury near Newbury, in the English county of Berkshire.[3] She studied art history in Scotland at the University of St Andrews, where she met William in 2001. Their engagement was announced in November 2010. They married on 29 April 2011 at Westminster Abbey. The couple's children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis of Cambridge, are third, fourth, and fifth in the line of succession to the British throne, respectively.[4][5][6][7][8]  The Duchess of Cambridge's charity works focus mainly on issues surrounding young children, addiction, and art. To encourage people to open up about their mental health issues, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry (now the Duke of Sussex) initiated the mental health awareness campaign ""Heads Together"" in April 2016.[9] The media have called Catherine's impact on British and American fashion the ""Kate Middleton effect"".[10] In 2012 and 2013, Time magazine selected her as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World.[11][12]  Early life  Catherine Elizabeth Middleton was born at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading on 9 January 1982 into an upper-middle-class family.[13][14][15][16][17] She was baptised at St Andrew's Bradfield, Berkshire, on 20 June 1982.[18][20] She is the eldest of three children born to Michael Middleton (b. 1949),[21] and his wife, Carole (née Goldsmith; b. 1955),[22] a former flight dispatcher and flight attendant, respectively, who in 1987 founded Party Pieces, a privately held mail order company that sells party supplies and decorations with an estimated worth of £30 million.[23][24][25] Her father's family has ties to British aristocracy and benefited financially from trust funds which they established over 100 years ago.[26][27][14][28] Her Middleton relatives were reported as having played host to British royalty ""as long ago as 1926"".[29][30] She has a younger sister, Pippa, and a younger brother, James.[31]  The family lived in Amman, Jordan, from May 1984 to September 1986 where her father worked for British Airways (BA). Middleton attended an English-language nursery school.[32][33] When her family returned to Berkshire in 1986, she was enrolled aged four at St Andrew's School, a private school near Pangbourne in Berkshire. She boarded part-weekly at St Andrew's in her later years.[34] She studied at Downe House School.[35] She was a boarder at Marlborough College, a co-educational independent boarding school in Wiltshire,[36][37] and graduated in 2005 from the University of St Andrews in Fife, Scotland, with an undergraduate MA (2:1 Hons) in the history of art.[38] Before university, during a gap year, she travelled to Chile to participate in a Raleigh International programme, and studied at the British Institute of Florence in Italy.[39]  In November 2006, Middleton worked as an accessory buyer with the clothing chain Jigsaw,[40] where she worked part-time until November 2007. She also worked until January 2011 at the family business in catalogue design and production, marketing, and photography.[18][41] Prior to her marriage, Middleton lived in an apartment owned by her parents in Chelsea, London, which was estimated to be worth £1–1.4 million.[42] In 2018, Catherine's total net worth was estimated at £5–7.3 million, most of which is from her parents' company.[42]  Relationship with Prince William  Early relationship  In 2001, Middleton met Prince William while they were students in residence at St Salvator's Hall at the University of St Andrews.[43] She reportedly caught William's eye at a charity fashion show at the university in 2002 when she appeared on the stage wearing a see-through lace dress.[44] The couple began dating in 2003, although their relationship remained unconfirmed.[45] During their second year, Middleton shared a flat with William and two other friends.[46] On 17 October 2005, Middleton complained through her lawyer about harassment from the media, stating she had done nothing significant to warrant publicity.[47]  Middleton attended Prince William's Passing Out Parade at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst on 15 December 2006.[48][49] Media attention increased around the time of her 25th birthday in January 2007, prompting warnings from the Prince of Wales, Prince William, and Middleton's lawyers, who threatened legal action. Two newspaper groups, News International, which publishes The Times and The Sun; and the Guardian Media Group, publishers of The Guardian, decided to refrain from publishing paparazzi photographs of her.[50]  In April 2007, Prince William and Middleton ended their relationship. The couple decided to break up during a holiday in the Swiss resort of Zermatt.[51] Newspapers speculated about the reasons for the split, although these reports relied on anonymous sources. Middleton and her family attended the Concert for Diana in July 2007 at Wembley Stadium,[46] where she and Prince William sat two rows apart. The couple were subsequently seen together in public on a number of occasions and news sources stated that they had ""rekindled their relationship"".[52]  On 17 May 2008, Middleton attended the wedding of Prince William's cousin Peter Phillips to Autumn Kelly, which the prince did not attend.[53] On 19 July 2008, she was a guest at the wedding of Lady Rose Windsor and George Gilman. Prince William was away on military operations in the Caribbean, serving aboard HMS Iron Duke.[54] In 2010, Middleton pursued an invasion of privacy claim against two agencies and photographer Niraj Tanna, who took photographs of her over Christmas 2009.[55] She obtained a public apology, £5,000 in damages, and legal costs.[56]  Marriage and children  The newly married Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on the balcony of Buckingham Palace (2011) William and Catherine with their first son the day after his birth (2013)  Prince William and Catherine Middleton became engaged in October 2010, in Kenya, during a 10-day trip to the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy to celebrate his passing the RAF helicopter search and rescue course.[57][58] Clarence House announced the engagement on 16 November 2010.[57][59] Prince William gave Middleton the engagement ring that had belonged to his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. The couple married in Westminster Abbey on 29 April 2011[60] (St. Catherine's Day), with the day declared a bank holiday in the United Kingdom. Estimates of the global audience for the wedding ranged around 300 million or more, whilst 26 million watched the event live in Britain alone.[61][62][63] On marriage, Catherine assumed the style ""Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge"".[64]  In October, several months after the wedding, Commonwealth leaders pledged that they would implement changes in British royal succession law to adopt absolute primogeniture, meaning the first child of the Duke and Duchess, whether male or female, would be next in line to the throne after their father.[65]  On 3 December 2012, St James's Palace announced that the Duchess was pregnant with her first child. The announcement was made earlier in the pregnancy than is usual as she had been admitted to King Edward VII's Hospital suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of morning sickness. She remained in the hospital for three days.[66][67] Prince George was born at St Mary's Hospital in London on 22 July 2013.[4][5] The severe morning sickness returned with the subsequent pregnancies, forcing Catherine to cancel her official engagements.[68] She gave birth to Princess Charlotte on 2 May 2015[69] and to Prince Louis on 23 April 2018.[70]  Public life  Middleton's first public appearance with Prince William following the announcement of their engagement was at a fundraising event organised by the Teenage Cancer Trust in December 2010.[71] She was formally introduced to public life on 24 February 2011, two months before the wedding, when she and Prince William attended a lifeboat-naming ceremony in Trearddur, Anglesey, in North Wales.[72] A day later they appeared in St Andrews to launch the university's 600th anniversary celebrations.[73] In March 2011, the couple toured Belfast.[74] Their last public engagement before the wedding was a visit to Darwen Aldridge Community Academy.[75][76] On 16 February 2011, Clarence House announced the couple's first royal tour of Canada would take place in July 2011.[77] In May 2011, shortly after the wedding, Clarence House announced the Duke and Duchess would extend their tour to visit California.[78] This was to be the Duchess's first visit to the United States.[79]  Catherine and William meet the Obamas at Buckingham Palace two weeks after their wedding (2011)  The Duchess's first official engagement after the wedding came in May, when she and her husband met Barack Obama, the President of the United States, and First Lady Michelle Obama.[80] On 26 October 2011, she undertook her first solo event for In Kind Direct, stepping in for the Prince of Wales, who was in Saudi Arabia.[81] On 2 November, the Duke and Duchess visited the UNICEF Supply Division Centre for supplying food to malnourished African children in Copenhagen, Denmark.[82][83] On St. Patrick's Day, 17 March 2012, the Duchess carried out the traditional awarding of shamrocks to the Irish Guards at their base in Aldershot; this was her first solo military engagement.[84] On 19 March, she gave her first speaking engagement for the opening of the Treehouse, a new children's hospice opened by East Anglia's Children's Hospices (EACH), a charity of which she is a patron.[85]  In June 2012, The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry was renamed The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, to reflect Catherine's contribution to the charity.[86] The Duke and Duchess were announced as ambassadors for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, alongside Prince Harry.[87] As part of her role, the Duchess attended numerous sporting events throughout the games.[88] In September 2012, the Duke and Duchess embarked on a tour of Singapore, Malaysia, Tuvalu, and the Solomon Islands as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.[89] During this overseas visit, she made her first official speech abroad, while visiting a hospice in Malaysia, drawing on her experience as patron of East Anglia's Children's Hospices.[90][91]  After the birth of Prince George, the Duchess carried out her first engagement in late August when she accompanied the Duke to meet runners preparing for an ultra-marathon on the isle of Anglesey, where they had a residence.[92][93] At the beginning of March 2014, details were announced of the half-month-long tour to New Zealand and Australia that the couple and their son would be taking from 16 to 25 April.[94] The tour was Catherine's first visit to the area and Prince George's first major public appearance since his christening in October 2013.[95] The tour began in New Zealand where they visited Wellington, Blenheim, Auckland, Dunedin, Queenstown and Christchurch. It ended in Australia where they visited Sydney, the Blue Mountains, Brisbane, Uluru, Adelaide, and Canberra.[96] In June 2014, the couple visited France to attend the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Normandy landings at Gold Beach.[97]  On 21 July 2014, it was announced that the Duchess would be making her first solo trip, visiting the island of Malta on 20–21 September 2014, when the island was celebrating its 50th independence anniversary.[98] Her trip was cancelled, with the Duke taking her place, after the announcement of her second pregnancy in early September.[99] In December 2014, the couple visited the United States and attended a charity dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[100] In April 2016, the Duchess and her husband undertook a tour to India and Bhutan.[101] The Duke and Duchess toured Canada again in September 2016.[102] On 11 October 2016, the Duchess made her first solo foreign trip to The Netherlands.[103] Countries visited by the couple in 2017 include France, Poland, Germany, and Belgium.[104][105][106][107] The Duchess takes official portraits of her children and joined the Royal Photographic Society in 2017.[108] She visited Luxembourg City in May 2017 for the Treaty of London commemorations.[109] In January 2018, the couple visited Sweden and Norway.[110] The Duchess accompanied her husband on a tour of Pakistan in October 2019, which was the royal family's first visit to the country in 13 years.[111]  Charity work  Patronages  In March 2011, the Duke and Duchess set up a gift fund held by The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry to allow well-wishers who wanted to give them a wedding gift to donate money to charities they care about instead.[112][113] The gift fund supported 26 charities of the couple's choice, incorporating the armed forces, children, the elderly, art, sport and conservation. These causes were close to their hearts and reflected the experiences, passions and values of their lives.[114][115]  The Duchess of Cambridge's charity works focus mainly on issues surrounding young children, addiction, and art.[116] She has a number of patronages: The Art Room, National Portrait Gallery, East Anglia's Children's Hospice, Action on Addiction, Place2Be, Natural History Museum, Anna Freud Centre, Sportsaid, and The 1851 Trust.[117][118][119] The Duchess, who was an art student, takes an interest in art and handpicked the Art Room, which ""helps disadvantaged children express themselves"" through art therapy, and the National Portrait Gallery.[120] In her capacity as patron of Action on Addiction, the Duchess has occasionally made visits to its centres, spending time with recovering addicts.[121] The Duchess is joint Patron of 100 Women in Hedge Fund's Philanthropic Initiatives, along with Prince William and Prince Harry.[122] She is also a local volunteer leader with the Scout Association in north Wales,[123] of which the Queen is patron, and the Duke of Kent is president.[116] It aims to provide activities to over 400,000 young people in the UK.[116]  In 2012, together with the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, Catherine launched Coach Core. The program was set up following the 2012 Olympics and provides apprenticeship opportunities for people who desire to pursue a career as a professional coach.[124] In October 2012, the Duchess gave her royal patronage to the M-PACT programme (Moving Parents and Children Together), one of the only UK programmes to focus specifically on the impact of drug addiction on families.[125] In December 2015, she assumed the patronage of the Royal Air Force Air Cadets[126] for youths 12–19 years of age. The Duke of Edinburgh, who had been patron of the RAF Cadets for 63 years, formally handed over during an audience at Buckingham Palace.[127] In 2017, she replaced the Queen as patron of The Lawn Tennis Association,[128] All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club,[129] and Action for Children.[130]  In January 2018, locks of her hair were reportedly donated to the Little Princess Trust, a charity which makes wigs for children diagnosed with cancer.[131] In February 2018, the Duchess became the patron of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.[132][133] She also launched Nursing Now, a three-year worldwide campaign to raise awareness about the profile of nurses. She said the campaign was personal to her as both her grandmother and great-grandmother were volunteer nurses.[134][132][133][135] In March 2018, Kensington Palace announced the Duchess of Cambridge would become the first royal patron of the Victoria and Albert Museum.[136][137] In July 2019, she lent her support to Backyard Nature, a campaign created to inspire ""children, families and communities to get outside and engage with nature"".[138] In August 2019, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge competed in the King's Cup yachting regatta to raise money for eight different charities.[139] In December 2019, she succeeded the Queen as Royal Patron of Family Action.[140]  In December 2019, after consulting various organisations and experts, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge announced the Earthshot Prize, which will be given to five individuals or organisations who could come up with solutions for environmental problems between 2021 and 2030. The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will run the project, which is also supported by philanthropists.[141]  In June 2019, she succeeded the Queen as patron of the Royal Photographic Society.[142] In January 2020, she and other photographers took part in an exhibition to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of the Holocaust.[143] In May 2020, the Duchess as the patron of the National Portrait Gallery launched ""Hold Still"", a project to capture people's life in the UK during the Covid-19 pandemic.[144]  Advocating for mental health  Catherine, who has tackled issues surrounding mental health and disabilities, has made visits to charities and hospitals such as St Thomas' Hospital and Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute to spend time with mothers and children who deal with these issues.[145][146][147] To encourage people to open up about their mental health issues, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry initiated the mental health awareness campaign ""Heads Together"" in April 2016. The Duchess later voluntarily talked about her problems as a mother, and admitted that she suffered a ""lack of confidence"" and ""feelings of ignorance"" during certain periods of time.[9][145][148]  The Duchess of Cambridge also launched the Mentally Healthy Schools, a project which helps the students and staff with access ""to reliable and practical resources to improve awareness, knowledge and confidence in supporting pupils' mental health.""[149] Benita Refson, president of Place2Be, one of Catherine's patronages, has praised the Duchess's work saying she would help ""shine the spotlight on child mental health.""[150] In February 2016, she travelled to Edinburgh to promote the work of Place2Be, launched Children's Mental Health Week, and contributed to the HuffPost UK as a part of the Young Minds Matter movement, an effort ""to raise awareness for children's mental health issues.""[151][152] The Duke and Duchess later met with members and representatives of Young Minds and Youthscape to promote their mental health campaign.[153] In recognition of their work with charities concerned with children's mental health, the Duchess and her husband were awarded the Gold Blue Peter badge, an award previously granted to the Queen.[154] During a speech at the Royal Foundation forum in 2018, the Duchess said she would continue her work to raise awareness for mental health and said that ""The mental health of children and adults is one area where a long-term view will make all the difference to future generations.""[155]  In January 2019, it was confirmed that the Duchess would work together with the Royal Horticultural Society as one of the co-designers for a garden display at the 2019 Chelsea Flower Show.[156] Catherine designed the ""Back to Nature Garden"" together with Andree Davies and Adam White.[157] The garden, which featured ""a tree house, waterfall, rustic den and a campfire"" among other parts, was unveiled at the Chelsea Flower Show in May 2019 to emphasize ""the benefits the natural world brings to mental and physical well-being"".[158][159] The garden was later expanded and moved to Hampton Court Palace as a part of the Hampton Court Palace Flower Show.[160] In May 2019, as a part of their ""Heads Together"" initiative, the Duchess of Cambridge together with her husband and in-laws, launched Shout, a text messaging service for those who suffer from mental issues.[161] In October 2019, the Duchess of Cambridge, together with other members of the royal family, voiced a PSA video for Public Health England ""as part of its Every Mind Matters program"".[162] In January 2020, Catherine launched a national survey on early childhood development by embarking on a 24-hour tour of the United Kingdom. Ipsos MORI run the survey between 21 January to 21 February on behalf of the Royal Foundation to encourage people to take part in the conversation about the issues concerning children under 5.[163] In late March 2020, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge started supporting a new mental health initiative by the Public Health England amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.[164] In Britain's Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week of May 2020, she engaged in a video call with new parents, midwives and other maternity service professionals to promote her message of mental health awareness during the pandemic.[165]  Public image and style  Middleton, prominent for her fashion style, has been placed on numerous ""best dressed"" lists.[166][167] The Daily Telegraph selected her as the Most Promising Newcomer on its 2006 list of style winners and losers.[168] Tatler placed her at number eight on its yearly list of the top ten style icons in 2007.[169] People featured her on its 2007 and 2010 best-dressed lists.[170] Middleton was named one of Richard Blackwell's ten Fabulous Fashion Independents of 2007.[171] In June 2008, Style.com selected her as its monthly beauty icon.[172] In July 2008, Vanity Fair included her on its international best-dressed list.[173] In February 2011 the Global Language Monitor named her the Top Fashion buzzword of the 2011 season.[174] In January 2012, the Headwear Association voted her Headwear Person of the Year.[175] Middleton was number one on Vanity Fair's annual best dressed lists in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013; she also appeared as the cover star in 2012.[176] The Duchess was named to the International Best Dressed Hall of Fame List in 2014.[177] In 2014, she was already being regarded as a British cultural icon, with young adults from abroad naming her among a group of people who they most associated with UK culture. These included: William Shakespeare, Queen Elizabeth II, David Beckham, J. K. Rowling, The Beatles, Charlie Chaplin, Elton John and Adele.[178][179] In June 2016, she took part in her first magazine shoot for Vogue's centenary issue appearing on the cover.[180] In 2018, Tatler named her on its list of Britain's best dressed people, praising her for ""recycling her looks, rather than wearing them as one-offs"", as well as her use of ""both high street and high-end brands"".[181]  The ""Kate Middleton effect""[10][182] is the trend that the Duchess is reported to have had on others in sales of particular products. While Catherine wears items from many new designers, she has also worn dresses by Catherine Walker, who designed many of Diana's favourite evening gowns and day suits.[183] She has worn outfits, hats and ensembles by many other fashion designers.[184][185] The brands she favours are noted in the media.[184][185]  The Duchess, who attended the 71st British Academy Film Awards, did not participate in Time's Up movement calling for women to wear black on the red carpet.[186] Royal protocol forbids members of the royal family from taking part in political movements but she wore a black sash and carried a black handbag as a variation to the informal black dress code.[187][188] In March 2018, together with the Countess of Wessex, the Duchess hosted the Commonwealth Fashion Exchange reception at Buckingham Palace during 2018 London Fashion Week.[189]  Privacy and the media  The death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in Paris while being chased by paparazzi in 1997,[190] influenced the Duke's attitude towards the media.[191] The Duchess and her husband have asked that, when off-duty, their privacy should be respected.[191]  In 2009, before her engagement to William, Middleton was awarded £10,000 damages and an apology from the photographic press agency Rex Features Ltd. after she was photographed playing tennis on Christmas Eve while on holiday in Cornwall.[192]  In September 2012, the French edition of Closer and the Italian gossip magazine Chi, published photographs of the Duchess sun-bathing topless while on holiday at the Château d'Autet[191] (a private château on a 260-ha estate 71 km[193] north of Aix-en-Provence). Analysts from The Times believed the photographs were taken from the D22 (Vaucluse) road half a kilometre from the pool—a distance that would require an 800-mm or a 1000-mm lens.[194] On 17 September 2012, the Duke and Duchess filed a criminal complaint with the French prosecution department and launched a claim for civil damages at the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Nanterre.[195] The following day the courts granted an injunction against Closer, prohibiting further publication of the photographs and announced a criminal investigation would be initiated.[196] Under French law, punitive damages cannot be awarded[197] but intrusions of privacy are a criminal offence carrying a maximum jail sentence of one year and a fine of up to €45,000 for individuals and €225,000 for companies.[198][199] In September 2017, Closer was fined €100,000 and its editor Laurence Pieau and owner Ernesto Mauri were each fined €45,000.[200]  In December 2012, two Australian radio hosts, Michael Christian and Mel Greig, called King Edward VII's Hospital where the Duchess was an in-patient for hyperemesis gravidarum. Pretending to be the Queen and the Prince of Wales, Greig and Christian spoke to a nurse on the Duchess's ward, enquiring about her condition. Following a hospital inquiry and a public backlash against the hoax, Jacintha Saldanha, the nurse who put the call through to the ward, committed suicide.[201] The radio hosts subsequently apologised for their actions.[202]  In February 2013, Chi published the first photos of Catherine's exposed baby bump, taken during her vacation on the private island of Mustique. The British press refused to publish the paparazzi shots.[203] While the Duchess was visiting the Blue Mountains in Sydney, a picture was taken of her bare bottom as her dress blew up. Many newspapers outside the UK published the picture.[204]  On 14 August 2015, Kensington Palace published a letter detailing what it stated were the ""dangerous"" and invasive efforts of the media to get paparazzi pictures of Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Jason Knauf, communications secretary to the Cambridges, wrote the letter to media standards organisations in various countries.[205]  In May 2020, Kensington Palace said that the cover story of Tatler magazine titled 'Catherine the Great' contained ""a swathe of inaccuracies and false misrepresentations"". Despite the palace's statement that most of the material was not given to them before publication, the magazine's editor-in-chief announced that he would stand behind the story as the palace had been aware of it for months.[206]  Titles, styles, honours and arms  Titles and styles  Royal monogram  Catherine is, by marriage, a princess of the United Kingdom and entitled to the style of Royal Highness.[207] She is usually styled as ""Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge"".[208] When in Scotland, she is known as the Countess of Strathearn.[209] Northern Ireland is represented by a third title, Lady Carrickfergus.[208][a]  Honours  Commonwealth honours  Honorary military appointments  Honorific eponym  Awards  Arms  In September 2013, the Queen granted a conjugal coat of arms to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, consisting of their individual arms displayed side by side, beneath a helm and coronet denoting the duke's status as grandson of the sovereign.[219] Below is shown the earlier grant of the duchess's personal arms, impaled with those of her husband.  Ancestry  The Duchess of Cambridge's father, Michael, and her paternal ancestors were from Leeds, Yorkshire. Her paternal great-grandmother Olive was a member of the Lupton family, who are described in the City of Leeds Archives as ""landed gentry, a political and business dynasty""; previously unpublished pictures revealed in March 2015 that Olive Middleton had grown up at the family's ancestral seat of Potternewton Hall Estate[223][224] alongside her cousin, Baroness von Schunck (née Kate Lupton).[31][225][226][227][228] Catherine's paternal ancestors also include her great-great-grandfather politician Francis Martineau Lupton (1848–1921), whose first cousin Sir Thomas Martineau was the uncle of World War II Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.[229]  The Duchess's maternal ancestors, the Harrisons, were working-class labourers and miners from Sunderland and County Durham.[230] Ancestors through her maternal line include Sir Thomas Conyers, 9th Baronet (1731–1810), who was a descendant of King Edward IV through his illegitimate daughter Elizabeth Plantagenet.[231] Other ancestors are Sir Thomas Fairfax (1475–1520) and his wife Anne Gascoigne, who was a descendant of King Edward III.[232][233]  Authored articles  Notes  ^ Even with the title Lady Carrickfergus, she is still mostly referred to as the Duchess of Cambridge in Northern Ireland, as per given sources.

Regardless of the weather, The Duke and Duchess’ eldest son always wears shorts during public appearances.    According to a royal expert, young boys wear shorts as a sign of being a member of the upper class British elite.    Prince George, 4, is a member of the royal family and third in line to the throne, so much uphold this tradition.    Etiquette expert William Hanson told Harper’s Bazaar: “It's a very English thing to dress a young boy in shorts.  ""Trousers are for older boys and men, whereas shorts on young boys is one of those silent class markers that we have in England.    ""Although times are (slowly) changing, a pair of trousers on a young boy is considered quite middle class – quite suburban.

2223,"OPINION  POSSIBLY the only thing more surprising than the news that Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt were the unceasing, unremitting details.  As a brand, Brangelina spent more than a decade on lockdown: Their camp had no leaks. Tabloids knew nothing the couple didn’t want known. Their image as the chic-est, jet-setting-est, most racially harmonious family on Earth was impenetrable.  Until Tuesday, when Jolie’s filing demanding sole physical custody sent the media into overdrive: What had Pitt, heretofore known as a devoted father, possibly done?  Incredibly, almost on the hour, the story kept advancing: TMZ reported that Jolie had concerns “with the way Brad was parenting” and that she was “fed up” with his heavy use of weed and alcohol. He had an “anger problem.”  Next came accusations of Pitt cheating — with a co-star and with Russian hookers, their nationality an odd detail — of using hard drugs, and of verbally and physically attacking one of their children on a private plane.  Within 72 hours, the world knew more about Brangelina than in the 12 years they had been together. It was sordid and dirty, the photo negative of the perfect ­image they had so smugly, aggressively promoted.  The likeliest source of that narrative flip? Angelina Jolie, who at 41 has masterfully manipulated the media for over two decades.  Strategically, Jolie seems miles ahead of Pitt, but she may lose the long game. Video reportedly exists of the plane incident, and no physical altercation is said to have occurred. People have come to ­admire her, but they love him.  “The whole thing seems very impetuous,” says Jolie’s biographer, Andrew Morton. “Her mother would freeze out people for whatever reason, and now Angie has frozen out Brad — who was far more dignified and just issued a quiet statement.”  By so publicly disparaging the father of her children — some old enough to read what’s being said online — Jolie is endangering her own self-created myth, that of ­depraved Hollywood hellion-turned-St. Angelina, humanitarian nonpareil.  “It’s Bad Dad vs. St. Ange,” Morton says. “The ultimate losers are the children.”  And Jolie’s halo, which may be revoked.  It’s easy to forget how deeply weird Angelina Jolie was when she came on the scene in the mid-’90s. There’s an entire generation that knows her as an actress, yes, but more so as the selfless philanthropist, the devoted mother of six, one-half of the most glamorous couple in Hollywood.  Jolie has never used a publicist, and this has only added to the sense — true or not — that she’s authentic. But she is, at heart, an actress. Jolie and her estranged father, actor Jon Voight, share one key trait: Both, she’s said, are “drama queens.”  As a premillennial starlet, Jolie was unlike any of her peers. She was in stark opposition to the arch, cosmopolitan WASP-iness of Gwyneth Paltrow, who was then engaged to Pitt. She made Winona Ryder’s eccentric darkness seem purely adolescent. Drew Barrymore, with her trauma, her drug use and mid-20s marriage spree, could not compare.  Jolie carved her own niche, controlled her own narrative, and it was impossible to look away. She was the wildest of the wild. She divulged thoughts and experiences so outlandish, you had to wonder how much was true.  She spoke of self-harm, rampant drug use — heroin, she said, her favourite — her bisexuality, how much she loved knife-play and S&M, her history of insomnia and eating disorders, of committing herself to the psych ward at UCLA for 72 hours, of suicidal ideations and of once hiring a hit man to kill her before changing her mind. All this by age 22.  In 1996, she married British actor Jonny Lee Miller. She said she wed in a white shirt with Miller’s name scrawled in blood on the back.  They divorced in 2000, the same year Jolie began cavorting with her brother, James Haven, on red carpets, making out in front of photographers. When she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar that year for Girl, Interrupted, she gushed over him in her acceptance speech.  “I’m so in love with my brother right now,” she said.  It was too weird, even by Hollywood standards. Haven quickly receded from Jolie’s public life, and within weeks, she wed her Pushing Tin co-star Billy Bob Thornton, who was then engaged to actress Laura Dern.  “I left our home to work on a movie,” Dern told Talk magazine in 2000, “and while I was away, my boyfriend got married, and I’ve never heard from him again.”  Jolie and Thornton — then 24 and 44, respectively — embraced their role as Hollywood’s premier freak-show couple. They wore ­vials of each other’s blood around their necks and boasted of wild sex on fur-lined harnesses.  The marriage lasted four years, until the moment Jolie said was life-changing: Her decision, while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider in Cambodia, to adopt a child.  “I knew once I committed to Maddox,” she said, “I would never be self-destructive again.”  Jolie divorced Thornton. “She used the same M.O. as with Brad — accused him of having affairs and being drunk,” says Morton, her biographer. “As soon as Maddox came along, Billy Bob had served his purpose.”  Thus Jolie began her pivot from savage, man-stealing sex bomb to valiant single mom of an indigent child. She began working with the United Nations as a goodwill ambassador. Her time in Cambodia, she said, “made me suddenly realise certain things about the world and how much I had to learn.”  She was a spoiled Hollywood brat who orchestrated her public awakening to the less fortunate and duly expressed shame. As an actress, things were less exciting. She trudged along in a series of unremarkable movies: Original Sin, Life or Something Like It, Beyond Borders, Alexander.  It wasn’t until 2004, when she replaced Nicole Kidman in a film called Mr. & Mrs. Smith, that Angelina Jolie’s star power ­became stratospheric.  This, of course, was the movie where Pitt and Jolie met and fell in love. At the time, Pitt was married to Jennifer Aniston, and they were considered Hollywood’s golden couple: he the wholesome, Midwestern matinee idol, content with a bong and a beer, she the A-list star of Friends, the breezy, sort-of-plain popular girl who had landed the high-school quarterback.  Jolie, with or without Pitt’s knowledge, helped extricate him from that marriage expertly. In April 2005, amid rumours of their affair, Pitt flew to visit Jolie and her toddler son in Kenya. Paparazzi somehow knew to be there, and a now-iconic image of Jolie, Pitt and Maddox made the cover of US Weekly.  Aniston had said goodbye to Pitt hours earlier, with no knowledge of his plans. “The world was shocked, and I was shocked,” Aniston told Vanity Fair that year.  Rumours were rampant that Jolie was pregnant with Pitt’s baby — compounding the tabloid narrative that Pitt badly wanted to be a dad but, denied by his career-obsessed wife, had no choice but to leave.  “My worst fear,” Aniston’s friend Kristin Hahn told Vanity Fair, “is that Jen will have to face them having a baby together soon, because that would be beyond painful.”  In July of that year, Jolie adopted a baby girl from Ethiopia, an event she announced in People magazine. She began heavily publicising her work as a UN ambassador. To paraphrase the old saying about Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire: Jolie gave Pitt gravitas, and Pitt gave her respectability.  In May 2007, the couple relocated to Namibia, where a heavily pregnant Jolie was again shot by paparazzi, with Pitt and her two children, on otherwise empty sand dunes — this, even though the couple had gotten the Namibian government to ban all journalists from entry so she could give birth there.  After their daughter Shiloh was born, Pitt and Jolie gave a press conference only to Namibian reporters. They sat on a dais with Namibia’s president, Sam Nujoma, formerly the country’s dictator, and began their spin off planet Earth.  In 2007, Jolie began forcing celebrity journalists to sign contracts before interviewing her. These forbade “any questions regarding her personal relationships,” even though her personal relationships were exactly what she was selling. In April of that year, People glowingly reported Jolie’s adoption of a 3-year-old boy from Vietnam.  His mother was still living, and Jolie changed his name from Pham Quang Sang to Pax. He spoke no English, but no matter — the magazine deified Jolie, shooting her in profile, holding her new toddler as they gazed off at the horizon. In less than two years, Jolie and Pitt had a family of four.  “I know we seem crazy, just bringing them in one after the other,” Jolie told The New York Times in 2008, the year she gave birth to twins Knox and Vivienne.  “But we do plan,” she said. “We make sure one is absorbed completely into the family before we add ­another.”  Sanding down their scandalous origin story further, Jolie founded the Maddox Jolie Pitt Foundation in 2006. Though the couple have always said they donate all the money they make from selling family photos to magazines, tax filings raise questions.  In 2008, the year they sold pictures of the twins to People for $US14 million, the foundation gave away a little over $6 million. The UN High Commission on Refugees got $US100,000; the Council on Foreign Relations — which extended membership to Jolie the year before — got $110,000, and Pitt’s own non-profit, Make It Right, got $1 million.  The year before, the MJP Foundation listed itself as a “consultant” to Make It Right, earning $US204,867 in fees. It also listed nearly $4 million in assets invested, with, among others, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch. They donated just $1.4 million, with $333,000 going to the UNHCR, which finally, after nearly $1 million in total donations from MJP, named Jolie a special envoy in 2012.  In 2014, People paid $US2 million for the Jolie-Pitt wedding photos. But the magazine doesn’t appear on MJP Foundation filings. However, Asprey, the jewellery company that has commissioned designs from the couple, does.  Reps for Pitt and ­Jolie did not return requests for comment.  As adroit as she has been, Jolie has seemed to lose touch with how she’s actually perceived. Her pretension has become boundless: bragging to a UK radio program that her six kids speak seven languages, including sign language.  “Vivienne really wanted to learn Arabic,” she said.  Vivienne is 8.  Jolie has been publicly on the verge of quitting acting since 2005, ready to sacrifice movie stardom for her kids — never a mention of the nannies — her charities, the world. In November, she begins a visiting professorship at the London School of Economics. She is reportedly seeking to move to England permanently to join the House of Lords, which requires UK citizenship, and remake herself yet again, this time as a politician.  “I’ve never loved being in front of the camera,” she said in 2014.  It’s a transition sparked, most likely, by her failed attempts to become a serious writer-director. Each successive film — 2011’s In the Land of Blood and Honey, 2014’s Unbroken and last year’s disasterpiece, By the Sea, in which she and Pitt played a couple on the verge of divorce — has bombed exponentially.  The Sony hack revealed true ­industry opinion of Jolie. “Minimally talented spoiled brat,” wrote super-producer Scott Rudin to then-Sony chief Amy Pascal. “She’s a camp event and a celebrity and that’s all.”  By seeking to elevate herself by denigrating Pitt, Jolie’s hypocrisy has begun to show. Whatever went down on that plane, it most likely can’t be worse than having her children witness their father’s public humiliation at their mother’s hands — the ultimate irony for a woman who prides herself on motherhood above all.  As she told The New York Times in 2008, she was already worried about what her children might read about their lives. “There’s a lot we’re going to have to explain to them,” she said, “about how public their family is.”  Additional reporting by Isabel Vincent.

3630,"MARIAH Carey has stepped out wearing her 35 carat diamond engagement ring from her ex-fiance James Packer — even though they split up a year ago.  The Sun reports that the singer flashed the $10 million rock as she attended a Chanel party with her backing dancer boyfriend Bryan Tanaka.  The singer dated Packer for 18 months before they split up in October 2016.  However, that hasn’t deterred Carey from wearing the impressive piece of jewellery.  Carey’s ring matched her glittering ensemble for the fashion party, which was attended by Karl Lagerfeld, Naomi Campbell and Gigi and Bella Hadid.  She wore a plunging black shimmering gown with a silver belt around her waist and made sure all eyes were on her as she performed at the party.  It comes after Packer admitted he was “at a low point” in his life when he dated Carey.  Last week, the Australian billionaire, 50, broke his silence on his whirlwind engagement to the 47-year-old superstar.  Speaking to The Australian, he confessed the romance was a “mistake” for them both.  “I was at a low point in my personal life. Documenting the negotiations with my sister was taking longer than expected,” he said.  “She was kind, exciting and fun. Mariah is a woman of substance. But it was a mistake for her and a mistake for me.”  Packer continued to explain that he was in over $5 billion worth of debt at the time he met Mariah.  “Two years ago I was terrified. I had $2.3 billion of debt at CPH ­[Consolidated Press Holdings, his private company], over $3 billion of debt at Crown, I’d just appointed Rob [Rankin as chairman of Crown], Macau was falling over and [sister] Gretel was on my doorstep.  ‘Then, a year later, I’ve got China falling apart, the Australian casino businesses missing budgets by big amounts, I’ve got Mariah breaking up with me and I’m thinking, ‘F**k!’.”  The father-of-three also admitted that his “biggest regret” was getting divorced from his ex-wife Erica Baxter, who later dated chart topper Seal for 12 months.  He added: “It is my biggest regret that I let my marriage to Erica fail. It is what it is and she is doing an incredible job with the kids and we are in a great place.”  Carey was left devastated when Packer ended their nine-month romance last year and she reportedly blamed Scientology for the split when their engagement was suddenly called off.  Insiders claimed at the time that she believed Packer — who was a Scientologist between 2002 and 2006 — had been influenced by his business manager and former Church of Scientology spokesman tommy Davis, who Carey believed poisoned his mind against her.  Packer’s camp denied Scientology had anything to do with their split and instead, sources claimed he blamed it on Carey’s excessive spending and the drama surrounding her as she filmed her reality show Mariah’s World.  The pair were first introduced by mutual friend Brett Ratner at the premiere of Hercules in 2014.  In January 2016, Packer got down on one knee and proposed with a striking 35-carat diamond engagement ring, which was rumoured to be worth $10 million.  She is also still great friends with her ex-husband Nick Cannon, with whom she co-parents her six-year-old twins Monroe and Moroccan.  This article originally appeared in The Sun",fake

James Franco, 39, is so surprised that Scarlett Johansson, 33, decided to call him out in her powerful speech at the 2018 Women’s March in Los Angeles on Jan. 20 that he’s not sure if or when he will respond. “James was pretty stunned that Scarlett called him out—albeit not by name, but pretty obviously,” a source close to James EXCLUSIVELY revealed to HollywoodLife.com. “He’s not going to respond though because he feels that by doing so he just adds fuel to the fire. James is stuck between a rock and a hard place—if he responds then it’s like he’s disparaging those women who are speaking out, and if he doesn’t then some may think he assumes a level of guilt.” Although five women have come forward to accuse the actor of alleged sexual misconduct since Ally Sheedy cryptically tweeted about him during the 2018 Golden Globe Awards, he has denied the accusations. Check out some of the best pics from the 2018 Women’s March here!  Despite the claims, James has been supporting the Time’s Up movement and doesn’t want to be stereotyped from the recent headlines about him. “James was horrified that he was branded as some kind of sexual aggressor—as far as he’s concerned that couldn’t be further from the truth,” the source continued. “He’s a big supporter of the movement, and he’s really happy that women are finally being given a voice—if he has to take a hit, for something he swears he hasn’t done, then so be it. James knows what’s in his heart, and he knows that he’s a good person.”  With James claiming to have his own story about his past, there’s been high anticipation about where the accusations toward him will lead. Only time will tell with this situation but one thing remains in tact: women in the entertainment industry and beyond are fighting back hard to stand up for what they believe in! In addition to Scarlett, high profile actresses such as Natalie Portman, 36, Eva Longoria, 42, and Alyssa Milano, 45, spoke out about their own personal stories at the Women’s March in LA and Atlanta.

3592,"Wake up, Mr. West.  As an encore to last year’s epic rant, Kanye West made the most of his allotted four minutes — stretching it to almost seven — during Sunday’s Video Music Awards, when he graced the stage inside Madison Square Garden to praise his one and only: himself.  “I am Kanye West. And that feels really great to say that especially this year,” West began. “I came here to present my new video, but before I do that imma talk.”  “Now later in the night, ‘Famous’ [West’s music video] might lose to Beyoncé. But I can’t be mad, I’m always wishing for Beyoncé to win,” he alluded to the VMAs moment from years past, in which he swiped the mic from Taylor Swift in the great stage crash of 2009.  West, 39, referenced his ongoing feud with Swift, 26, saying, “We came over in the same boat, now we’re all in the same bed. Well, maybe different boats, but … If you think about last week, there was 22 people murdered in Chicago. You know, like, people come up to me like, ‘Man, that’s right… Take Taylor? I love all y’all. That’s why I called her!”  He continued to explain the music video, in which nude likeliness of Donald Trump, Anna Wintour, Amber Rose and other famous personalities are sprawled out in bed, “But for people to understand just how blessed we are, it was an expression of our now, our fame right now. Us inside of the TV — you just know.”  “The audacity to put Anna Wintour right next to Donald Trump. I mean, I put Ray J in it bro!” he exclaimed.  After giving wife Kim Kardashian‘s ex a shout out, he did the same for his former flame, Amber Rose.  “I see you Amber,” he said to a smiling Rose in the audience. “My wife is a G — not a lot of people’s wives would let them say that.”  West continued to name drop, comparing himself once again to Steve Jobs and Walt Disney.  “I sit down and talk to older like rich people. A.k.a. white. And they tell me don’t compare yourself to Steve Jobs, don’t compare yourself to Walt Disney … They told me there are three keys to keeping people improving. Taking away their resources and role models. My role models are artists, merchants, Truman, Ford, Hughes, Disney, Jobs, West,” he explained.  West then signed off with a few final words of his wisdom about the future of the industry.  “Tonight we’re here to have fun. I’m standing in front of my idol Puff Daddy,” West said. “I’m standing in front of my wife Kim Kardashian West. I’m standing in front of the future, Chance the rapper. 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith. We are undeniably the influence, the thought leaders. I’m gonna play y’all a piece of my art and I hope y’all have a good time.”",fake
3158,"Although it’s been announced the royal couple will officially reside in Kensington Palace when they are married, Megha and Harry are planning to spend at least ‘four months’ in the US.  After all, the American starlet is really close to her mum, Doria Radlan, and Harry will do anything he can to make his new bride happy.  As an active humanitarian, Meghan is also planning to not only make positive changes in the UK, but stateside as well.  And as a wedding present to themselves, they are spending an impressive US$16 million to make their dream come true.  Sources say the pair have ‘fallen in love’ with this stunning Italian-style property with dramatic views over the Pacific Ocean.  It has eight bedrooms and eight bathrooms, a large swimming pool, hot tub, waterfalls and koi ponds and is just steps from a private beach.  ‘There’s tonnes of space for entertaining,’ discloses a pal. It also has its own cinema, a state-of-the-art gym, floodlit tennis court (perfect for when sporty Kate comes to stay) and a two-storey guest house.  ‘It’s everything Harry and Meghan could want – and it’s perfect for when they have kids.’  The lovestruck young royal is splurging with the millions he received in inheritance from his mum Princess Diana when he turned 30, in 2014.  And actress Meghan is chipping in some cash too.  ‘They are planning on spending $1 million refurbishing the house to their own tastes,’ explains the pal.  Even before the pair got engaged they decided that they were going to split their time between London and LA.  ‘They toyed with the idea of getting a house in Beverly Hills, but thought it would be much more fun to have a place by the beach,’ they continued.  ‘They plan on spending three or four months a year in Malibu. It means that Meghan gets to see her mum and friends a lot.  ‘In fact, they are trying to convince her mum to move into the guesthouse, so she gets the run of the place when they are away,’ says the source.  ‘Harry has had the cash sitting in his bank account for more than three years now and he always intended to spend it on property.  ‘He knows his mum will approve of the purchase.’  Malibu is home to dozens of celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Britney Spears, Halle Berry, Mel Gibson and Orlando Bloom.  ‘It’s not grand like the houses Harry is used to in London, but he is mesmerised by the thought of living right next to the sea and somewhere so glamorous and exciting.  ‘Meghan thinks it’s funny because she is the exact opposite. She is used to the Malibu lifestyle, but has to pinch herself that she now gets to live in a palace and is getting married in a castle!’  William is said to be ‘a tad jealous’ that Harry and Meghan are getting a pad in California.  Royal duties for the future king of England would prevent the first-born prince and Kate from spending too much time away from the mother country.  Instead, William and Kate will divide their time between multiple estates across the UK, and use Harry and Meghan as an excuse for the odd cheeky escape from royal duty.  ‘He knows it’s not something that he and Kate could get away with – but they plan on visiting them a lot!’ the source says.  The insider also says that Harry and Meghan will still make London their main home.  ‘But Meghan plans to do a lot of charity work in the US and she and Harry want to have a base in LA so they can host fundraisers and invite Hollywood movers and shakers to contribute. But, also, that Malibu beach house is just a cool place to hang out and get away from the pressures of royal life,’ the source added.

1647,"Rumours are intensifying that the singer and her fiance, Aussie actor Liam Hemsworth, are about to become parents.  The engagement ring is back on, they’ve moved in together (well, kind of), and now word on the street is that Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are expecting a baby! In January, just weeks after it was revealed that Miley and Liam were back together after their engagement breakdown in 2013, American magazine Life & Style reported that a friend claimed Miley was going off her birth control pill. At the time, Hollywoodlife.com claimed that “Miley has babies on the brain”. At the time, the reports were dismissed as idle gossip, but now, as more details come to light, it appears the claims are being taken more seriously.  Tum-thing to hide, Miley?  The usually scantily clad singer has been photographed several times in recent days wearing much frumpier clothes.On most occasions, she has been careful to hide her stomach behind bags or loose-fitting jackets. Australia’s own NW magazine has declared the 23-year-old singer is pregnant with a baby boy and is due in August. “[Liam] is over the moon. His very own little surfer dude!” says a source. “They feel very blessed. It’s a dream come true.”  The couple was engaged in 2012, split a year later, only to reunite in Australia's Byron Bay over the recent summer holidays.  Either way, the couple’s behaviour since the shock reunion has certainly been interesting. They’ve sort of moved back in together – Miley purchased a house just metres from Liam’s property in Malibu, California. There appears to be a private lane connecting the two homes.  Miley has also continued to share images of herself on social media smoking what appears to be marijuana. But eagle-eyed fans were quick to point out to NW that they suspect the shots are old as Miley isn’t wearing her engagement ring, which has been back on her finger for two months. Whether or not the rumours are true, there’s no denying the pair would make adorable parents. Miley has long proved her maternal instinct by adopting a menagerie of rescue animals, while 26-year-old Liam is besotted with his brothers Chris and Luke’s children. “I love my brothers’ kids. It’s funny. As an uncle, you become so protective of them,” Liam – who even lets niece India paint his toenails! - admits. “When I go away and I shoot something, I constantly want to see photos of them. It’s a beautiful thing.”",fake
3454,"Brad Pitt  The one that got away. For both, perhaps?

When he won a Golden Globe for 12 Monkeys in 1996, Pitt's final thank you was reserved for ""especially the love o' my life, my angel, Gwyneth Paltrow."" They got engaged, they even got matching haircuts, but then they broke up in June 1997.  Paltrow has been relentless in blaming herself for the demise of their relationship, telling Diane Sawyer in 2003, ""I'm so lucky that I spent time with Brad, somebody who was such a good person! Especially when I was, like, such a mess."" Admittedly the relentless media attention—which peaked when long-lens nude photos of the couple taken while they were vacationing in the Caribbean ended up online—really got to her then, understandably so.  ""My kind of internal stuff really tripped up that whole relationship,"" Paltrow said. ""And I felt really responsible, and also like I was the architect of my own misery...I just made a big mess out of it.''  The actress told Howard Stern in 2015 that her beloved father, Bruce Paltrow, who died in 2002, ""adored him like a son."" But ""I was such a kid, I was 22 when we met. It's taken me until 40 to get my head out of my ass. You can't make that decision when you're 22 years old...I wasn't ready, and he was too good for me.""  Only recently did Paltrow tell the New York Times that she too was subject to unwanted advances from alleged serial predator Harvey Weinstein roughly 20 years ago, when she was dating Pitt—and that Pitt confronted Weinstein at an event afterward, warning the producer that something like that had best never happen again. So there was more going on at the time for Paltrow to process than anyone publicly knew about for decades.  By the time of the Sawyer sit-down, Pitt was married to Jennifer Aniston. ""We're able to sort of see each other and smile and wish each other well,"" Paltrow said.",fake
3749,"A few months after Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt in the fall of 2016, several tabloids linked the actor to another one of the hottest actresses in Hollywood: Kate Hudson. Earlier this year, sources told E! News the romance rumors were false—but still, they persisted.  So, when Hudson appeared on Bravo's Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen Tuesday, she was more than happy to set the record straight, once and for all. ""That was the craziest rumor of all time,"" said Hudson, who was promoting her book. ""There's nothing true to that.""  ""As a matter of fact,"" Hudson said, ""I hadn't actually seen him in, like, four years."" Pitt, who remains single, isn't the worst person to be falsely associated with, of course. ""It was kind of an awesome rumor,"" the actress joked. ""I kind of liked it. I was like, 'OK, fine. We're having twins!'""",fake
12448,"""Invasion!"" is the third annual Arrowverse crossover event, with episodes of the television series The Flash, Arrow and Legends of Tomorrow on The CW, and is inspired by the 1989 comic miniseries Invasion!. Events at the end of the Supergirl episode ""Medusa"" on November 28, 2016, marked the beginning of the crossover, which began on November 29 with The Flash, continued on Arrow on November 30, and concluded on Legends of Tomorrow on December 1. Each of the main three episodes were titled ""Invasion!"". In the crossover, Barry Allen recruits Kara Danvers / Supergirl from Earth-38 to Earth-1 to help his team, Oliver Queen and his team, and the Legends to defeat the alien race known as the Dominators.  Development of a crossover between the three series and Supergirl began in May 2016, when it was learned that Supergirl would move to The CW from CBS for its second season. By the following September the scripts for each episode were written, and were filmed in October 2016. The premise and episode titles were also announced in September. In ""Invasion!"", the main cast members of each series appear in (at least) their own series; Melissa Benoist appears as Supergirl in the entire crossover. A number of actors and characters from previous Arrow seasons returned to reprise their roles, since Arrow's episode doubled as its 100th.  The three episodes of the crossover received positive reviews, with critics praising the interaction among the actors in each series and each episode's advancing season storylines as part of the crossover. The Dominators storyline was regarded as its weakest link, with reviewers finding the alien race's motivations unclear. Ratings for the episodes were high, with each breaking records in viewership and the 18–49 rating and contributing to the most-watched week on The CW in six years. A fourth crossover, ""Crisis on Earth-X"", occurred the following year.[1]  Plot [ edit ]  Barry Allen investigates a meteor crash outside Central City which is a spaceship from which aliens emerge. Lyla Michaels tells the team that the Dominators had landed during the 1950s, but mysteriously departed. Barry assembles the original members of Team Arrow, Thea Queen, the Legends, and Kara Danvers, Supergirl of Earth-38. The team begins training at a S.T.A.R. Labs facility, sparring with Supergirl to prepare for the aliens. Kara struggles to earn Oliver Queen's trust. Cisco Ramon finds and reveals a message Barry's future self sent to Rip Hunter, which exposes Barry's manipulation of the timeline and its effect on other team members. As a result, only Oliver, Kara, Felicity Smoak, Martin Stein, Jefferson ""Jax"" Jackson, and Caitlin Snow still trust Barry.  After the Dominators abduct the President of the United States, the team goes to rescue him; however, Barry remains behind since most of them distrust him with Oliver staying behind in support of Barry. Kara leads the group, but the Dominators kill the President and activate a mind control device to take over the group. The controlled heroes return and attack S.T.A.R. Labs, where Barry and Oliver confront them. While Oliver holds them off, Barry lures Kara to the device and manipulates her into destroying it, freeing everyone from the Dominators' control. When the team regroups, Ray Palmer tells Barry that everyone forgives and trusts him. Sara Lance, Ray, John Diggle, Thea, and Oliver are then abducted by the Dominators.  They are held in pods on a Dominators' ship, each one unconscious except for a shared hallucination of simulated reality. In the hallucination, Oliver is living at Queen Manor, having never gotten on the Queen's Gambit, and is about to be married to Laurel Lance. His parents are alive, and Diggle is operating as the vigilante the Hood, instead of Oliver. The captives begin seeing flashes of their real lives, and realize what the Dominators have done to them. Their escape attempt is blocked by personifications of their enemies: Malcolm Merlyn, Deathstroke and two of his Mirakuru soldiers (who killed Ray's fiancée Anna Loring), and Damien Darhk and two of his H.I.V.E. soldiers. The adversaries are defeated, and the five awaken in the Dominators' ship and escape in a shuttle. Felicity, Curtis Holt, and Cisco try to hack into the Dominators' mainframe. Aided by Barry and Kara, they recover a device to locate the captives, who are rescued by Nate Heywood in the time ship, Waverider. Aboard the Waverider, Ray deduces that the Dominators were gathering information about metahumans, using the hallucination as a distraction, to help them build a special ""weapon"". Meanwhile, the Dominator mothership heads towards Earth.  Nate says that the first Dominator invasion occurred in 1951 in Redmond, Oregon. He goes there with fellow Legends Mick Rory and Amaya Jiwe and Felicity and Cisco to kidnap a Dominator for information. Although they are successful, the three Legends and their alien captive are taken prisoner by N.S.A. agents. The Legends learn from the Dominator that the aliens have arrived to assess humanity's threat, now that metahumans have appeared and formed the Justice Society of America. Felicity and Cisco rescue the Legends, and also set the Dominator free, carelessly altering history. In 2016 Central City, the team learns that the Dominators know about Barry's manipulation of the timeline, deem him a threat, and are demanding his surrender in exchange for peace. After the Legends return, the team discovers that the Dominators' weapon is a bomb that will kill all metahumans on Earth, with millions of collateral human casualties. The teams dissuade Barry from surrendering, and he and Cisco reconcile. The team manage to destroy the bomb and force the Dominators to retreat with a pain-inflicting nano-weapon. As the heroes celebrate their victory, Oliver offers Kara his friendship; Cisco gives her a device which will enable her to interdimensional travel and communicate between Earth-1 and Earth-38. Martin persuades Jax not to tell the others that his daughter Lily's existence is the result of a temporal paradox he inadvertently caused when the Legends were in 1987.  Cast and characters [ edit ]  Main and recurring [ edit ]  Note: Despite being credited, Josh Segarra does not appear in the Arrow episode.[2]  a b Supergirl episode ""[3] Barry and Cisco both appear at the end of theepisode "" Medusa "", to recruit Supergirl.  Guests [ edit ]  Production [ edit ]  Development [ edit ]  In May 2016, after it was announced that Supergirl would air its second season on The CW instead of CBS, CW president Mark Pedowitz said that all four series—Arrow, The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow, and Supergirl—would cross over during the 2016–17 television season.[14] In September 2016, Greg Berlanti, creator and executive producer of all four series, said that the crossover event would only involve The Flash, Arrow, and Legends of Tomorrow;[15] the event begins at the end of the Supergirl episode ""Medusa"", with Barry and Cisco Ramon arriving on Supergirl's Earth to recruit her.[3] Andrew Kreisberg, executive producer on Arrow, The Flash, and Supergirl, explained why the crossover did not include Supergirl: since ""Medusa"" was the mid-season finale for Supergirl and the other three series had theirs in episodes after the crossover, they ""wanted to make sure that [""Medusa""] spoke to what had been happening on the first seven episodes of Supergirl and not just as a tie in"". He added that it would have been logistically difficult to incorporate the four series, noting that finding the time for Melissa Benoist to shoot material for the other three series was complicated. Benoist did not appear in much of ""The Darkest Place"", the episode before ""Medusa"", to make her available to appear in each of the crossover episodes.[16] He expanded on the difficulties, saying that ""built-in shut-down days"" for Supergirl were not planned on, in part because the series switched from CBS to The CW, and that this inability to shut down normal production prevented it from having a larger role in the crossover.[17]  It was announced the following September that the villains in the event would be the Dominators, in a story inspired by the 1989 comic miniseries Invasion![18] The Dominators were chosen because the writers ""collectively wanted the superheroes to face an external threat,"" meaning ""a threat that came from outside of the shows"", rather than extraterrestrial.[19] The following month, Arrow and Legends of Tomorrow creator and executive producer Marc Guggenheim said that the title of each episode of the crossover would be ""Invasion!"".[20]  In November 2016, Kreisberg said that the Dominators would appear during the later part of Supergirl's season after the crossover event.[21] Guggenheim said that in the initial script for The Flash, Lynda Carter appeared as the Vice President (becoming President after his death in the episode); Carter appears as President Olivia Marsdin on Supergirl. This did not occur because a note from the studio felt it would have been too confusing, having Marsdin appear as president on one series (and another Earth) and vice president on the others. Guggenheim added, ""In the midst of time travel and aliens, it was just one sci-fi problem too much"" and conceded that ""if people at the studio were confused by the script, it was probably not particularly friendly to casual fans.""[22]  Writing [ edit ]  Scripts for ""Invasion!"" were written in mid-September 2016, with Berlanti creating the story for the event and Kreisberg helping to craft the story of The Flash episode.[23][24][25] The teleplay for The Flash was written by showrunners Aaron and Todd Helbing;[25] Arrow's was written by showrunners Guggenheim and Wendy Mericle,[23] and showrunners Phil Klemmer and Guggenheim wrote the teleplay for Legends of Tomorrow.[24] When the Dominators were chosen as the threat for the crossover, the writers were able to justify the heroes' uniting; since Supergirl ""is knowledgeable about these particular enemies, the Legends can help better understand the last time the Dominators visited Earth thanks to their time travel capabilities, and both Teams Flash and Arrow have a diverse array of capable heroes who are able to understand and counter just about every imaginable threat.""[19]  Arrow's episode in the crossover was also the series' 100th. Guggenheim said that Berlanti's idea for the episode ""allow[ed] us to have our cake and eat it too"" in respecting Arrow as a whole and incorporating it into the crossover, with Guggenheim calling it ""a love letter"" to the series as a whole. The producers were able to incorporate many actors from earlier in the series, with others who could not appear because of scheduling conflicts still represented.[3] At the end of The Flash episode, Oliver, Thea, Sara, Diggle, and Ray are captured by the Dominators and held in stasis with their minds experiencing a ""shared hallucination""; this allowed the writers ""to revisit footage from the previous 99 episodes"" in the characters' memory flashes.  Filming [ edit ]  The three episodes were filmed from September 23 to October 12, 2016.[23][24] They were filmed concurrently, with some cast members shooting scenes for several series each day. Filming was done at the Boundary Bay Airport.[27] The Flash's episode was directed by Dermott Downs,[28][25] Arrow's by James Bamford,[23] and Legend of Tomorrow's by Gregory Smith.[24]  Visual effects [ edit ]  The crossover's visual effects were by Encore Post and Zoic Studios.[29][13] The Dominators were created with ""cutting-edge prosthetics and computer effects ... to achieve a feature film-quality look which is faithful to Invasion! artist Todd McFarlane's interpretation of the characters.""[18] Although they originally wore the green robes of the comics, Guggenheim said that when it was decided to create the species in CGI, the robes ""made animating them prohibitively impossible"".[30]  The S.T.A.R. Labs facility where the heroes initially meet was made to look like the Hall of Justice in the Super Friends animated series. Stock footage of the building in Cincinnati that was used as the basis for the Hall of Justice, Union Terminal, was altered by Encore for the crossover.[29]  Colin Donnell and Colton Haynes appear as holograms, reprising their roles as Tommy Merlyn and Roy Harper, at the end of the Arrow episode. They appeared as holograms (not physically) due to other commitments which prevented their being re-shot. Guggenheim said that Zoic Studios had to rotoscope them from older episodes noting ""It was hard, obviously because they had to work with preexisting footage. Yes, they had [many] episodes to choose from, but it was a lot harder than that makes it sound.""[13]  Marketing [ edit ]  Despite ""Invasion!"" only occurring on three of the four CW series, the event, marketed as ""Heroes v Aliens"", was called a ""four-night crossover event"" beginning with the Supergirl episode.[31] In Canada, where The Flash, Arrow and Legends air on CTV Television Network, the crossover was marketed as a three-night event entitled ""Heroes United"".[32] A faux classified U.S. government video was released, set about 70 years in the past, detailing the Dominators' first attempt to conquer Earth.[33] The crossover's trailer was released on November 23, 2016.[34]  Release [ edit ]  Broadcast [ edit ]  After beginning in the final scene of the November 28, 2016, episode of Supergirl, the first part on The Flash aired on November 29, followed by part two on Arrow on November 30, and concluding with part three on Legends of Tomorrow on December 1, all on The CW.[28]  Home media [ edit ]  The episodes, the rest of Legends of Tomorrow's second season, The Flash's third season and Arrow's fifth season were released separately on Blu-ray and DVD in Region 1 on August 15, 2017,[35] September 5[36] and September 19, respectively.[37] The three episodes, accompanied by three ""Allied: The Invasion Complex"" behind-the-scenes featurettes (included separately in each series' home media release), were released together on a separate DVD on August 17, 2017 in Region 2[38] and September 20 in Region 4.[39] The episodes are available for streaming on Netflix and The CW app in the United States.[40][41]  Reception [ edit ]  Ratings [ edit ]  Ratings for ""Invasion!"" episodes No. Series Air date Rating/share  (18–49) Viewers  (millions) DVR  (18–49) DVR viewers  (millions) Total  (18–49) Total viewers  (millions) 1 The Flash November 29, 2016 1.5/5 4.15[42] 0.9 2.17 2.4 6.31[43] 2 Arrow November 30, 2016 1.3/5 3.55[44] 0.7 1.80 2.0 5.34[43] 3 Legends of Tomorrow December 1, 2016 1.2/4 3.39[45] 0.7 1.84 1.9 5.24[43]  ""Invasion!"" gave the CW its most-watched week in six years.[46] The Flash episode had a season-three-high viewership (the series' largest since December 9, 2014) and a season-three-high 18–49 rating, the highest since February 16, 2016. The episode improved 40 and 36 percent in viewership and the 18–49 rating, respectively, on the previous episode, ""Killer Frost"".[47] It increased by five percent in total viewers and seven percent in the 18–49 demographic from the previous year's crossover with Arrow.[48] The Arrow episode had a season-five-high viewership and 18–49 rating, with viewership on a par with the previous year's crossover and the 18–49 rating the best since then.[49] The episode improved by 120 and 86 percent in viewership and the 18–49 rating, respectively, from the previous episode, ""Vigilante"". The Legends of Tomorrow episode had a series-high viewership and a season-two-high 18–49 rating, which tied the rating set by the pilot on January 21, 2016.[46] The episode improved by 80 and 83 percent in viewership and the 18–49 rating, respectively, from the previous episode, ""Outlaw Country"",[50] and contributed to the most-watched Thursday on The CW in four years.[51]  Critical response [ edit ]  About the crossover as a whole, Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club said that the episodes did ""admirable work advancing the overarching narrative while maintaining each show's distinct perspective"" along with being ""a hell of a lot of fun, and it's significantly expanded the scope of the Arrowverse by bringing in an extraterrestrial enemy ... There's an entire universe to explore, and this crossover has opened the door for the CW's DC shows to go cosmic in the future.""[52] According to Ed Gross of Empire felt ""Invasion!"" was a ""proverbial mixed bag"". He felt ""Invasion!"" did an effective job of bringing the characters from each series together since ""the rapport between them feeling natural and oftentimes genuinely funny"". Gross took issue to how the crossover was promoted as ""a massive adventure"" when it turned out to be ""rather underwhelming. Part of that is creative—it would have been better to get a fuller understanding of who these beings really are and how they're able to know the long-term effects of Flashpoint; plus the resolution seems awfully pat ... and lacks the resolutionary scope that was expected."" Gross gave the crossover four out of five stars.[2] Collider's Allison Keene enjoyed the interaction of the cast members between the four shows, with The Flash setting the tone of the crossover, with the others incorporating ""its light-hearted, witty banter and a fast-paced action and editing"". However, the crossovers also have the ability to ""starkly highlight each show's weaknesses."" Keene concluded, ""There are things ""Invasion!"" as a whole did really well, and others it didn't, with each series' strengths and weaknesses being highlighted and tested. But with each new expansion, there are things the shows can learn from, and it remains fun for fans"".[53]  The Flash [ edit ]  The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 10 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, ""The CW marshals its lovable roster of superheroes all together to quell an Invasion! in a sprawling crossover event that makes great use of each series headliners' charms.""[54]  Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave The Flash episode an 8.4 out of 10, noting the appeal of seeing many of the Arrowverse characters joining forces. He was critical of the Dominators, feeling they were not ""well-defined... to unify these heroes"", resulting in the Flashpoint-related character drama to propel the first act. Schedeen continued, ""Everyone had their moment to shine, even more minor players like Felicity and Thea. But if there was one subplot that felt unnecessary and out of place, it was Wally's"", calling it ""forced"". Schedeen appreciated the focus on the fallout from Flashpoint, calling it ""one of the biggest flaws of Season 3 so far"" on The Flash, and hoped that more of the Dominators' comic backstory would appear in the crossover's other two episodes.[55] The A.V. Club's Scott Von Doviak gave the episode a B+, calling the episode an ""absurdly overstuff kickoff"" to ""Invasion!"" He enjoyed that the episode ""continues to advance the story arcs of this season of The Flash and finds a way to weave those ongoing conflicts into the multi-series story of an alien invasion."" Von Doviak questioned some of the episode's events, such as Barry's knowledge of the Legends adventures and his not caring about secret identities, and said that viewers ""who don't necessarily follow the other three shows religiously are at a disadvantage"".[56]  On Collider.com, Carla Day gave The Flash episode five out of five stars and called it ""brilliant"", saying, ""With so many characters on the scene, it would have been easy for the show to get overwhelmed by them all and lose The Flash's unique look and tone. But the writers effectively incorporated the other DC series' characters into the episode while keeping the show's light-hearted and funny demeanor."" Day's only complaint was about the Dominators' unclear motivations.[57] Entertainment Weekly's Chancellor Agard gave The Flash episode an A−, feeling ""Based on tonight's episode alone, this year's crossover is looking like it'll be the best one yet... This is really the first time Berlanti and Co. can tell a cohesive story, and it seems like it's paying off."" Agard felt the focus on the Team Flash drama made the episode ""drag a bit"" and, like Schedeen, his ""biggest problems were with the Wally stuff"" but conceded it was included ""for viewers who might only watch The Flash, and the episode does a good job of appeasing both kinds of fans.""[9]  Arrow [ edit ]  Rotten Tomatoes reported an 86% approval rating, based on seven reviews for the episode.[58]  Schedeen gave Arrow's episode an 8.7 out of 10, saying ""This Arrow episode worked much better as a 100th episode celebration than it did the middle act of the ""Invasion"" crossover,"" calling the shared hallucination premise ""an emotionally rich and action-packed way to celebrate the show's first 100 episodes."" Schedeen was critical of the Cisco and Team Arrow subplot that ""did little to advance the larger narrative"", as well as the overall pacing of the crossover up to this point.[59] Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave Arrow an A, stating that while ""Invasion!"" could have been ""an unholy mess"" trying to fit Arrow's 100th episode celebration in the middle of the crossover, by focusing on Arrow's past and including former cast members ""ends up giving the show a way to develop the power and the threat of the Dominators without this crossover just being three straight episodes of heroes and aliens punching each other."" Wilkins concluded, ""If this is how Arrow marks 100 episodes, then here's to 100 more. If this isn't the best episode in Arrow's history, it's damn close.""[60]  Collider.com's Kayti Burt said that the Arrow episode ""gets enough nostalgic hits in to make it work, while also giving us an exciting (batshit crazy) final act to launch us into the final part of the superhero crossover."" Burt felt the shared hallucination ""works because of the performance of all of the actors (including many returning ones) and the sentiment that this show has genuinely inspired in people."" Burt ""was a bit sad"" that the series would not have the opportunity to have a 100th episode outside the crossover, with the demands of moving the crossover ""sometimes at odds with what this episode was trying to do ... This episode was trying to do far too much and was therefore a bit of a mess, but it's hard to dislike an hour of TV that is earnestly trying to please its fans in so many different ways"". She gave the episode three out of five stars.[61] Sara Netzley of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an A, saying, ""We get enough cross-team action to make it a treat for viewers of the Berlanti-verse while still forwarding the ""Invasion"" story line—and honoring the characters, plots, and themes that have made Arrow such a satisfying show over the last four and a half seasons. It was a tall order, but the episode pulled it off.""[62]  Legends of Tomorrow [ edit ]  Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 9 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, ""The Arrowverse gang is back together. What more could you want?""[63]  Rating the episode an 8.8 out of 10, Schedeen said the crossover ""ended on a strong note. This episode delivered the most on the promise of superheroes joining forces to battle alien invaders. And even if there were a few points of frustration (mainly involving a lack of Supergirl early on), it made the most of the premise and delivered a rousing final battle."" He enjoyed the final back story of the Dominators, which gave them clearer motivations so they no longer felt like ""a completely faceless, generic alien threat"", and Cisco's creation of a device for Supergirl to travel between universes, which would allow for more frequent crossovers between the characters.[64] Sava graded the Legends of Tomorrow episode A-, feeling it did not have the same ""emotional punch"" of Arrow's episode, but was still ""a strong conclusion that has the good guys saving the day and learning more about themselves in the process."" He called the final battle ""anticlimactic"", noting it would have been more satisfying if there was a ""more creative use of all the different powers in this group working together, and... a stronger sense of collaboration among the human/metahuman fighters.""[52]  Entertainment Weekly's Shirley Li gave the episode a B+, as ""it didn't feel at all like a Legends of Tomorrow episode, despite all the quips from Mick and the blue chyron and the time traveling""; she said that it was more like a second Flash episode. Li also added that the ""budgetary constraints were glaring"", and gave as examples Thea's failure to appear in the episode and Kara's absence from the confrontation with the elderly glasses-wearing official after Oliver lashed out at her. Despite this, Li felt much of the episode worked, with each character getting a chance to shine ""and though the Dominators' motive [was] still somewhat muddled, the invasion sparked fun rapport among the teams... This might not drive any non-Legends viewers to watch Legends, but the episode gave plenty to Arrowverse fans.""[65]  Accolades [ edit ]  Comic Book Resources ranked The Flash, Arrow, and Legends of Tomorrow episodes 2016's 16th, 10th, and 3rd best episodes of comic book-related television series, respectively.[66]",real
3933,"    If a picture speaks a thousand words, then the Instagram accounts of Jennifer Lopez and boyfriend Alex Rodriguez could tell one epic story. Within hours of each other on Jan. 24, the former Yankee slugger posted a photo of a cryptic quote: “There’s nothing wrong with making a mistake, what’s wrong is not making the effort to make it right,” and the Shades of Blue star shared a photo of a gigantic bouquet of flowers Alex had sent her. The next day, she uploaded a selfie and captioned the photo, “It’s all in God’s hands always,” along with the hashtag #letgoandletgod. According to an insider, “That was aimed directly at Alex.”  Hollywood’s hottest duo is on the verge of flaming out. Jennifer, 48, is privately questioning her relationship with her boyfriend of nearly a year after learning he’s still in touch with former fling Lauren Hunter, a fitness model, who last year claimed in an interview that Alex, 42, had been sexting her for months — including while he was dating J.Lo. Recently, “someone went to Jennifer with new details that Alex was still texting with Lauren, and that’s what made Jennifer lose it,” the insider tells In Touch. “Of course, he said it wasn’t physical, and maybe it wasn’t, but in Jennifer’s book, that’s still cheating. They were head-over-heels in love and planning to get engaged. Now Alex’s actions have jeopardized everything.”  The damage runs deep. Jennifer, who’s endured three failed marriages, “was heartbroken to hear that Alex was talking to Lauren,” says the insider. “Even though they didn’t meet in person, Jennifer considered it a betrayal. Now she has friends and family watching out for her best interests, which means checking in and asking about Alex’s antics.”  She has good reason to worry. Last June, a month after Jennifer and Alex made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala in NYC, Lauren claimed in a bombshell interview that she was in frequent contact with the ex-athlete, whom she met at an Equinox gym in 2011. “A week before his relationship with Jennifer was announced, he was asking me to go to Miami,” she claimed. “He never even mentioned her.” Lauren also alleged that Alex (who has kids Natasha, 13, and Ella, 9, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis) cheated on then-girlfriend Cameron Diaz with her in 2011. Jennifer “would be an idiot to believe he’d be faithful,” she said. She also called Jennifer too vanilla for him. “I don’t think he’s sexually attracted to her,” she dished. “In bed… he’s probably picturing me.”  Jennifer, mom to nine-year-old twins Max and Emme with ex Marc Anthony, turned a blind eye to the initial interview. Now, she’s not sure what to believe. “Jennifer’s still on the fence,” says the insider. “She can either cut her losses and walk away from the relationship, or she can fight for it. I think she’ll fight for it.”",fake

877,"Reverend Swadley – the local wedding priest and friend of the Pitt family – has confirmed to friends that the A-list couple recently spent a week with Brad’s family, discussing detailed plans for a wedding.  It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar. He knows he wants Jen to be his wife again.  ‘We’re pretty sure they’ll be married in Missouri before the end of the year, Brad and Jen are both keen to push through their divorces as soon as possible so they can walk down the aisle together. That’s all that they want.’  For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!",fake
621,"""This person is an icon and an absolute badass that I could never even hope to be exactly like,"" said the actress.  Fox Searchlight on Saturday night rolled out the green carpet for a tennis-themed Battle of the Sexes premiere with stars Steve Carell and Emma Stone.  Also in attendance was the real Billie Jean King, who is played by Stone in the film.  ""Emma, thanks for making me look so good,"" King quipped about Stone when introducing the film, which follows her life as both a professional tennis player and a pioneer for equality for women.  As for the actress, Battle of the Sexes marks the first time in her career that she's had to play a real-life character.  ""I've never played a real person before and it's, like, this person is an icon and an absolute badass that I could never even hope to be exactly like,"" Stone told The Hollywood Reporter.  She added, ""Capturing the essence was very important to us. It was super challenging, but [King] was so warm and welcoming and open to all of it. She was generous with her story that it made it much easier than if she was like, 'Please don't make this movie about me, good night.'""  In fact, King had met everyone involved with the film before it started shooting. Although she had spent time with Stone, directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (who are also married) made sure the two kept their distance as well.  Faris told THR, ""It was important they met, but they were starting to get a little friendly and Emma realized, 'I think I need to have a little distance.' Emma said she felt weird because she had to just study videotape of Billie Jean. She needed to hear her voice at 29.""  Added Dayton, ""We were making a film about one year in [King's] life. It was good to have a little distance, and now we can all really embrace her.""  King chatted it up with both Carell and Stone at Saturday's afterparty, which was sponsored by FIJI.  Battle of the Sexes hits theaters Friday.",fake

12638,"Just days after Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in a Paris hotel, her sister Kylie Jenner faced a security breach of her own.  In a newly-released clip from Sunday's Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the youngest of the Kardashian/Jenner daughters frantically calls mom Kris after hearing from her alarm company.  'They said there's motion detectors, break-ins, glass breaking all in the master bedroom,' the 19-year-old tells Kris on a three-way call with Kris' boyfriend Corey Gamble.  Another security scare: Kris Jenner receives a call from youngest daughter Kylie about a possible break-in at her home in this clip from Sunday's Keeping Up With The Kardashians  'What if they do something to Norman?,' Kylie asks, worried about the safety of her Italian greyhound.  'They're not going to do anything to your dogs,' Kris says in attempts to calm her daughter.  On the call, Kylie tells her mom she is in Beverly Hills, which is an approximate 40-minute drive away from her Hidden Hills home.  Anxious: Kylie was not home during the robbery scare, here she updates Kris on her location  Kris' boyfriend of two years Corey makes a mad dash to Kylie's to investigate, but tells Kris he is 14 minutes away.  'I could run over there right now and be there in three minutes,' an anxious Kris replies.  Both Kris and Kylie reside in Hidden Hills, California.  Concern: Kylie feared robbers would run off with her beloved pet  Ever the protective boyfriend, Corey demands Kris stay at home, telling her 'You can't even protect yourself, let me deal with it.'  'Just chill out,' Corey urges Kris, reminding her that there have been issues with Kylie's alarm system.  'Don't tell me to chill out. You can't tell someone when they're having a panic attack to chill out,' Kris snapped back.  Dark moment: Kylie seen on March 11, 2017 in an all-black fishnet outfit leaving LA hot spot Catch  In true Kardashian fashion, viewers are left to wonder if Kylie's home was actually burglarized until the latest episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians airs Sunday on the E! network.  The family has been on high alert after Kim's gunpoint robbery in Paris where thieves tied the 36-year-old mother-of-two up and stole around $11 million dollars in jewelry from her in a hotel room.  In addition to Kim's October 2016 ordeal, sister Kendall also dealt with an alleged stalker showing up to both of her homes on multiple occasions.  Protective: Corey did not want Kris (both pictured here in November 2016) investigating the break-in on her own.  Last week, Kendall reported $200k of jewelry missing from her home, according to TMZ.  Kendall claims she noticed around items gone around 1 am. She had left the house for a few hours during the day.  There were no signs of forced entry and it is believed to be an 'inside job.'",real
