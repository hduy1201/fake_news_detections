The truth, though, is that a good chunk of them are swiping left and right just as often as the rest of us are.  Want to know which celebrities you’re most likely to see on one of your swipe binges, or at the very least the ones you may have glossed over in the past? Read on. And as they say, where there’s smoke there’s fire — in other words, these celebrities are hardly the only ones using dating apps.  1. Amy Schumer  While she ended up marrying someone else earlier this year, actress Amy Schumer admitted to meeting her ex-boyfriend Ben Hanisch on Tinder. “In my main profile picture, I was wearing sunglasses and a baseball cap with no makeup. It was a selfie and I made a gross face, looking as though I were dying, because I was hiking, so I was,” Schumer wrote in her 2016 book of personal essays, “The Girl With The Lower Back Tattoo.” “I also put up a picture of Sophia from ‘The Golden GIrls,’ Claire Danes making her cry face on ‘Homeland,’ and one more normal more normal photo where I was smiling and wearing a sweatshirt. Vanessa [Bayer] and I posted our profiles at the same time and scream-giggled like little girls.”  2. Adam Rippon  Earlier this year, figure skater Adam Rippon revealed that he met his boyfriend, Jussi-Pekka Kajaala, on Tinder. He told People that the relationship was still “fresh” — but that he’s “fresh,” too. “[We’ve] been talking for the past seven months” and then “started to hang out a little bit more, because we were both really busy,” Rippon said in April.  3. Demi Lovato  In her 2017 documentary “Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated,” Lovato opened up about using dating apps to connect with both men and women. “I am open to human connection, so whether that’s through a male or a female, it doesn’t matter to me.”  4. Katy Perry  In between her concerts and epic shoe collection, it appears that pop star Katy Perry also finds time to swipe. After Perry called it quits with fellow musician John Mayer back in 2014, Perry had the perfect response when asked if she was single by Power 105.1’s The Breakfast Club. “I’m really deep on Tinder, so I don’t have a lot of time,” she said.  5. Laverne Cox  You’ve seen her on “Orange Is The New Black,” and you probably follow her on Instagram. And if you’re so inclined, you can also look for her on Tinder. “Honestly, I’m a Tinder girl. When I broke up with my ex, I went back on Tinder, because I feel like if you want to date, you have to be on the apps,” Cox told Natalie Morales and Kit Hoover while on “Access” in March. “You have to be on the apps to be in the game.” She admitted that she’s also “good at screening,” because she’s been “internet dating” for a long time now.  6. Zac Efron  Want to make your high school dreams come true? See if you can find “High School Musical” star Zac Efron on Tinder. If you swipe right, he’ll be thrilled. “Amazingly, when I signed up for Tinder, nobody swiped me!” Efron told the British Newspaper The Times in 2016. “They thought [my profile] was fake.”  Swiping left on Zac Efron sounds like a mistake we’d never get over.  7. Chelsea Handler  Ask talk show host Chelsea Handler how she feels about dating apps, and she’ll tell you she’s all about them. “Oh, I’m on all those apps,” Handler told ET’s Nischelle Turner. “I like to hook up, so when I go to London or New York or if I’m out of town and I want, I’ll do that … I’m on Tinder [and] all that stuff. I’m a regular person.”  8. Hilary Duff  With baby no. 2 on the way and a starring role on the TV show “Younger,” there’s no doubt that Hilary Duff is a busy young woman. But back in 2015, she revealed to Ryan Seacrest that she was on Tinder after speculation that her profile was fake. “It kind of started out to be a joke with my girlfriends. I was like, ‘Explain this whole thing to me because it’s kind of blowing my mind,’” she said. “In my life, I’ve always had really serious boyfriends, I’ve always met people through work, and I’ve never been on a blind date.”  9. Lindsay Lohan  Sure, it’s been a while since 2013 — but five years ago, Lindsay Lohan was so immersed in the online dating world that she actually found her brother on Tinder. “Look who I just found on @tinderapp … hey bro,” Lohan wrote in an Instagram caption.  10. Charlize Theron  While on “The Ellen Degeneres Show,” Charlize Theron opened up about the hilarious way Chelsea Handler convinced her to sign up for a dating app. “She was on her phone and she showed it to me and she was explaining it to me in that Chelsea Handler way, which is just like, ‘Yeah, everybody’s doing this. What’s wrong with you? Where have you been, under a rock?’” Theron said. “So then I took real interest, and I was like, okay, well tell me, how does it work? And she’s swiping all these faces of guys in all different sorts of — I’m going to sound like I’m 80....",

        "text": "A woman who was left with 'zombie boobs' after a failed fat transfer has to decide if she is willing to risk losing her nipples by having a second surgery to fix her deformed breasts.  In a preview clip from Thursday night's episode of the E! reality series Botched, Dr. Terry Dubrow warns his patient Shannon that it is a high-risk procedure because she doesn't have a great deal of blood supply coming into her nipples.  Although he has yet to lose a nipple over the course of his career, the surgeon admits that it's a possibility if Shannon decides to go under the knife again.  Scroll down for video  Looking for help: Shannon asks Dr. Terry Dubrow and Dr. Paul Nassif to fix her misshapen 'zombie boobs' on Thursday's episode of the E! reality series Botched  Yikes: The patient was left with deformed breasts after a failed fat transfer  'So, this is old. This is dead fat. So, all that fat transfer did was die,' Dr. Dubrow tells Shannon as he examines her breasts.  'For a fat transfer to the breast to work, the fat has to be good and the tissue you're transferring it to has to have good blood supply,' he explains during his confessional.  'In Shannon's case, that is absolutely not going to work, and, in my opinion, is a very weak solution.'  After nixing the possibility of a second fat-transfer surgery, Dr. Dubrow gives Shannon a rundown of the multi-step procedure she will have to undergo to fix her breasts.  The surgeon's complicated approach includes reconstruction and a new pair of implants.  'The breast tissue loss that you have from the original operation means the blood supply coming into the nipple is not that robust, he says. 'This is a risky procedure. I could lose your nipples with this.  No can do: Dr. Dubrow tells her that her breast is filled with 'dead fat,' explaining that a second fat transfer was out of the question  Complicated: Dr. Dubrow gives Shannon a rundown of the multi-step procedure she will have to undergo to fix her breasts, including reconstruction and new breast implants  'Have I ever lost a nipple? No. You want to be my first?' he asks Shannon, who shakes her head in response.  During her confessional, Shannon admits she is terrified because she would like to be able to breastfeed her children one day.  Dr. Dubrow also makes it clear that she won't have any control over what breast implants he decides to give her if she goes along with the surgery.  'I know what your goal is. You want to be filled out so when you're in clothes it looks like you've got breasts. You want a breast implant look, meaning you want a breast augmentation,' he says.  'But in terms of size, if you want me to do your surgery — I rarely say this to patients — it's up to me what size we use. That's my call, and if that's not acceptable, that's a deal breaker. It's up to me.'  Dr. Dubrow tells the camera that he needs Shannon to 'temper expectations' because she won't be getting her exact dream results if she has the surgery.  Complications: Dr. Dubrow explains that Shannon doesn't have a robust blood supply coming into the nipples because of the breast tissue loss she has from her original surgery  Say what? 'This is a risky procedure. I could lose your nipples with this,' he tells her  'It's scary,' says Shannon, and Dr. Dubrow agrees, telling her: 'It is scary. This is big-time, hi-risk surgery.'  However, Dr. Paul Nassif reassures her that Dr. Dubrow is a talented surgeon and the reward will most-likely outweigh the risks.  'The good news is you're now in someone's hands that is very good at this,' he says. 'There's a great chance of your breasts looking a lot better than you having a problem with your nipples.'  In another preview clip from the episode, Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif meet with Michelle, a woman who was left scarring on her chin after a botched surgery.  'I went into the doctor. He looked at my chin area and there was a double chin and some loose skin, so he said that I should put in an implant, and I should get some liposuction around my face and stuff,' she explains during her consultation.  Michelle agreed to the procedure, explaining that her original doctor was a 'board certified plastic surgeon.'  'Two days after he took the bandage off to see, and immediately there was a little lump here [on the right side of her chin]. And then there was a ball here [on the left side], and he said that was scar tissue and this [on the bottom right side of her chin], he wasn’t sure what this was,' she says.  Weighing her options: Dr. Paul Nassif reassures her that Dr. Dubrow is a talented surgeon and the reward will most-likely outweigh the risks  Struggle: Shannon has to decide if she is willing to risk losing her nipples by having a second surgery to fix her breasts  Dr. Dubrow stresses it's impossible to develop scar tissue in just a couple of days.  'Scar tissue does not form that quickly after surgery,' he tells the camera. 'If Michelle had a wound problem, it was because the surgical procedure reduc...",

        "text": "The Most Surprising Revelations From the New Dolly Parton Book — Including the Time She Contemplated Suicide  Behind the big hair, big acclaim and even bigger personality — nobody knows Dolly like Dolly.  Dolly Parton’s rags-to-riches story and complicated past are the focus of a new book, Dolly on Dolly, Interviews and Encounters with Dolly Parton. The book is not authorized or endorsed by Parton herself, but rather is a collection of interviews published over five decades of the 71-year-old country legend’s career and compiled by editor Randy L. Schmidt.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Here are some of the most surprising revelations detailed in the project:  Her dog Popeye stopped her from committing suicide  In the early 1980s, Parton contemplated suicide after having an “affair of the heart” that ended in heartbreak. As a result, she struggled with her weight, suffered from serious health issues and had to cancel a tour due to death threats — all while trying to get over the “nightmare” that was working with Burt Reynolds on the 1982 film, The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.  Parton says she was sitting in her bedroom one day when she eyed her handgun for a long time, before finally picking it up. At that moment, she says, her dog Popeye came running up the stairs.  “The tap-tap-tap of his paws jolted me back to reality [and] I suddenly froze,” Parton said in an interview. “I put the gun down. Then I prayed. I kinda believe Popeye was a spiritual messenger from God.”  She called peeing the bed a “pleasure” growing up  Parton has long been open about growing up poor in her hometown of Sevierville, Tennessee, but the book goes into further detail about how desperate the times were for her family.  In the summer, the kids would bathe in the river and then in the winter, they would bathe themselves with a pan of water. Parton was the fourth born of 12 kids, and she would have to bathe every night because three to four kids slept in a bed at a time and someone would ultimately pee the bed.  “That was the only warm thing we knew in the wintertime. That was our most pleasure to get peed on,” she described.  She has always had an open mind about sex  Though Parton won’t reveal the age when she lost her virginity, she admitted that she grew up fast and learned about sex from her older cousins and uncles.  “I always had an open mind about sex,” she said. “We all did. It was not a vulgar thing.”  She once threatened to shoot a man  At the age of 21, Parton and her friend were walking to a theater in Manhattan when men approached them thinking they were hookers.  As a man started grabbing Parton and offered her money, she pulled out a pistol and promised that if he touched her again, that she’d shoot him.  “I would have shot his feet off or shot at the ground,” she said. “That cooled the man’s jets and he took off.”  She thinks of her trademark appearance as a “gimmick”  Parton is known for her signature style, but she calls it all a “gimmick.”  ” I’ve never thought of myself as being a sex symbol and I don’t want to have to be a beautiful woman, like Raquel Welch,” she said.  As far as surgery goes, Parton said that her breasts are real although she has had them lifted. She admits, though, to nips and tucks, liposuction and collagen injections.",

        "text": "Whether she’s sailing by on a UPS truck or loudly proclaiming herself unable to come to the phone because she’s dead, Taylor Swift is increasingly inescapable. The star’s next conquest? The app store, which will see the debut of her proprietary app later this year, just in time to coincide with the publicity cycle for the artist’s new album, Reputation, slated for November.  The Swift Life comes from Glu Mobile, the same company responsible for games like Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and Nicki Minaj: The Empire. According to a first-look video the company released, Swift’s app will be less game and more access. It seems to borrow from the other Kim Kardashian app, the one that isn’t from Glu, the Kim Kardashian West Official App, which offers “premium” content to paid subscribers. “Connect with Taylor!” the video promises. “Get exclusive pics and video!” In addition to access to Taylor, the app will provide opportunities for Swift fans to connect and network with each other, building on Swift’s already-strong presence on platforms like Twitter, Tumblr, and Instagram.  The video also teases “Taymojis,” another feature strangely reminiscent of a certain reality TV star’s “Kimojis.” The two may be enemies engaged in a battle over “receipts,” but apparently that hasn’t stopped Swift from taking ample inspiration from Kardashian’s business playbook. In-app purchases weren’t mentioned in the preview but seem like a good bet, given Swift’s talent for monetizing her every move: That may be the real secret of the Swift life, which means the Swift Life will be right on brand.",

Oz has been on “The Chew” since its start in 2011, along with co-hosts Carla Hall, Mario Batali, Michael Symon and Clinton Kelly. Oz will not be replaced for the seventh season, which kicks off on Sept. 5.  “It has been so much fun having lunch with you on TV’s most delicious daytime show for the past six seasons, and I am immensely grateful to have found dear friends in my co-hosts and our team,” Oz said in a statement. “I have had the great privilege of growing up at our family table, and have shared some huge milestones along the way — including the birth of my first two children, and recent announcement of a third on the way! — and am lucky to have had ‘The Chew’ as a bright beginning to my career.”  Oz — the daughter of TV personality Dr. Oz — is a nutritional author, who first broke out on the scene with her best-selling book “The Dorm Room Diet,” which she wrote in 2006 when she was a college student. Aside from “The Chew,” she is also known for her regular appearances on various shows, including Food Network’s “Cooks vs. Cons.”  “The Chew” creator and executive producer Gordon Elliott said, “She is one of the greatest natural broadcasters I have ever worked with. The moment she sat at the table with Mario, Clinton, Michael and Carla, I knew we had a great television show. Her chemistry, honesty and intelligence are her trademarks, and they will stand with her wherever she goes.”  Rebecca Campbell, president, ABC-owned stations and daytime, added, “When Daphne started with us, she had recently graduated college, was a new bride and ready to take on the world. She is now a mother, broadcaster, writer and inspiration to millions of viewers whom she has shown how to create healthier eating options for themselves and their families. She really has created a unique brand for herself and the network.”  “The Chew” has been nominated for seven Emmy awards and has won two awards for outstanding informative talk show and outstanding informative talk show host for the group, including Oz, whose departure was first reported by TV Line.",

        "text": "A Georgia father wrote an open letter to Ariana Grande in the wake of the deadly Manchester suicide bombing that killed 22 and left dozens injured  Father Pens Moving Letter to Ariana Grande in Wake of Manchester Attack: 'Take Care of You First'  A Georgia father has penned a moving letter to Ariana Grande in the wake of the deadly suicide bombing that killed 22 people and left dozens more injured after one of the pop star’s concerts in Manchester, England.  Patrick Millsaps, a father of three teen daughters, offered some “redneck love” to the 23-year-old in his letter, declaring, “You don’t have a dadgum thing to apologize for.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “You see, you are no more responsible for the actions of an insane coward who committed an evil act in your proximity than you would be for a devastating natural disaster or acts of morons near your hotel,” he continued.  The candid address comes just days after Salman Abedi, 22, detonated an explosive at around 10:33 p.m. local time on Monday near the ticket office outside Manchester Arena, Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said.  Many remained hospitalized after the attack, as officials released the identities of those killed. Among the dead are an 8-year-old girl, Saffie Roussos, and several teenagers.  In the wake of the bombing, an insider told PEOPLE that Grande is “absolutely crushed” as a result of the incident.  “She and her loved ones have barely slept this week,” the source said.  Now, in his letter, Millsaps urged the star to take all the time to herself that she needs.  “Spend time with your God, your family and your friends who will give you space and support when you need it,” he wrote. “Hell, go lick as many freaking donuts as you want. Girl, you deserve it!”  Millsaps spoke of his own children — two 12-year-olds and a 13-year-old — in the letter, noting that they often listen to Grande’s music during the drive to school — “I will neither confirm nor deny that I have personally seen every episode of Sam & Kat.”",

The actor, who is working to stay in shape for his upcoming project, Six Billion Dollar Man, reveals on The Ellen DeGeneres Show Wednesday who would like him to put a top on.  “My daughters get very annoyed by the pictures. Very annoyed,” the 46-year-old says. “I get ‘Dad, put a shirt on’ all the time. Even when I have a shirt on! If I have one shirt, they say put another shirt on.”  Though his daughters may find their father embarrassing at times, his anti-dad bod does occasionally come in handy.  “They don’t like it when I scare the boyfriend and then all of the sudden they’re like, ‘Dad, can you come see me at school?’ because they want me to come and scare the boyfriend,” Wahlberg quips.  With four children, Wahlberg is thrilled with any affection they throw his way. He even brags about getting a recent hug from his eldest child, 14-year-old Ella.  “She was just off guard for a second,” he jokes to DeGeneres. “She slipped up for a second and didn’t realize it until we were mid-hug.”  In honor of his kids — Ella, Michael, 12, Brendan, 9, and Grace, 8 — Wahlberg wanted to come up with a way to get students excited to learn. He found that in a revival of Captain Kangaroo, the popular children’s TV show that aired from 1955-1984.  “I’m trying to find new ways to get my kids interested in science, technology, engineering, things like that. Mathematics, which is the worst,” Wahlberg shares. “So … what made me interested in school was Captain Kangaroo, which ran for, like, 30 years. They did 50 seasons. We are bringing back a cool STEM scientist as Captain Kangaroo.”  Last summer, Wahlberg exclusively told ET how he felt about a boy showing interest in Ella.  \"Nobody is a good type or sort. For me, you know, I'm super overprotective,\" he explained. \"But he's just a very nice, young, smart boy who is very polite and well prepared.\"  As for the rest of his kids, the dislike over the shirtless pics isn’t too surprising.  \"They pull no punches,\" he admitted last June. \"They're very honest.\"  Wahlberg may be in shape, but even he doesn't eat healthy all the time!

Marlene King and directed by Ron Lagomarsino.[7] King revealed the title of the premiere on Twitter on March 17, 2016.[8] On August 29, 2016, it was confirmed that this would be the final season of the series.[9]  Overview [ edit ]  A.D. gives the Liars 24 hours to find Charlotte's real killer or Hanna dies. While discussing possible suspects, the girls' suspicion fell on Alison. Aria suspects the red jacket blonde she saw entering the church was Alison. Emily finds the jacket in Alison's things and Caleb gives it to A.D. Meanwhile, Hanna manages to escape. Elliot's true motive is later revealed to Alison; she managed to use his phone to alert the girls to her location when he takes her out in his car one night. She jumps out of the car and he gives chase but Hanna accidentally runs him over and they bury him in the woods.  The Liars find out Jenna is calling Elliot as \"Archer\" on his burner phone. Mona then traces most of the sent messages from a secret apartment where they find out his real name is \"Archer Dunhill\". Toby discovers this and gets the cops to release Alison who reveals that she was the red jacket blonde but only tried to comfort Charlotte. Jenna befriends Sara and Noel begins helping them. Emily confronts Jenna and Sara. Jenna reveals that she became Charlotte's friend after feeling sympathy for her in Welby and helped Archer fake his identity to be with Charlotte. Sara reveals that they are all looking for the same thing but is killed soon after. A.D. tricks Hanna into believing Archer is alive and records her digging up his grave.  The Liars find videos in Noel's cabin of him torturing them in the dollhouse. Hanna kidnaps Noel after negotiating with him doesn't work and films an interrogation video. He manages to escape and lures the Liars to an abandoned blind school. They leave the dollhouse videos on a table and someone takes them but Noel and Jenna attempt to murder them. In the confrontation, Noel is accidentally killed, and Spencer is shot by A.D., while Jenna corners Spencer. Jenna prepares to kill Spencer, but is knocked out by Mary. She then reveals that Spencer is her second child. A.D. saves Jenna who asks if they shot Spencer.  One week later, Spencer has recovered and A.D. sends Jenna to confess to the cops that Noel wanted money Charlotte left Jenna for another eye surgery, killed Sara and tried to kill Jenna in the blind school. Peter returns and reveals that Mary is the one who killed Jessica. Hanna and Spencer follow the trail of a private investigator he hired to find Mary and bump into Ted who reveals he has been hiding her as she is his college fling with whom he conceived Charles. Mary reveals to Spencer that Peter and Jessica were planning to kill her, thus she used his pills to kill Jessica. A.D. then uses Emily's stolen eggs to impregnate Alison, as a way to further torture the liars. Meanwhile, A.D. hires Sydney Driscoll as their helper and she fakes being A.D. to recruit Aria into joining the A.D. team. Aria is forced into playing and becomes A.D.'s new helper, destroying Emison's baby nursery and leaving an \"A\" message in Spencer's house, until the Liars catch her in the act and she defects. Mona, who is becoming addicted to the A-game again, reveals that she tried to scare Charlotte into not resuming the A-game but Charlotte attacked her and she killed her in self-defense. Mary confesses to Rollins and Jessica's murder. A.D. ends the game as they have finally learned that Mona was Charlotte's killer.  One year later, Mary escapes from prison and Mona is released from Welby but rejoins the A-Team and is sent to kidnap Spencer, who comes face-to-face with A.D. – Alex Drake, her twin sister. Mary reveals she sold Alex to a London family to get out of Radley. Alex ran away and met Wren who revealed everything about Spencer to her and introduced her to Charlotte who left her everything. She became A.D. to use the Liars to find Charlotte's killer and killed Wren as he always saw her as Alex while she wanted to become Spencer to have her \"perfect life\". She explains that Sara was looking for Charlotte's false treasure in the Radley which was actually the secret file and Jenna recruited Noel to look for \"Charlotte's sister\". Jenna uses her enhanced sense of smell to figure out \"Spencer's not Spencer\" and alerts Toby who tells the...",

        "text": "It's only been a few days since Vanderpump Rules star Lala Kent went public with her married boyfriend, and now she's offering some dating advice like some sort of relationship expert.  Now, anyone can give advice -- you don't need a degree to have common sense or to tell someone that their boyfriend crossed a line.  But in Lala Kent's case, the advice that she's dishing out is ... controversial.  So, Lala Kent doesn't limit her good deeds to stripping down to fight SeaWorld and other aquatic circuses. She also gives out relationship advice.  Taking to Instagram Live, Lala Kent revealed a \"f--king crazy\" direct message that she'd received from a fan who wanted her input.  \"This girl was talking about this guy that she's pretty into, she's been seeing him for a while.\"  And the girl has a specific reason for talking to Lala for advice.  \"There's quite an age gap, it's kind of like me and my man, she's my age, maybe a little older...he's like in his later 40s.\"  Randall Emmett is 46. Lala will turn 28 this year.  \"And they've never been official but he was like really cute at the beginning and then he falls off the earth.\"  Uh-oh. That's not a great sign.  \"He's like inconsistent, which as women I think is f--ked up, like don't be inconsistent.\"  It might mean that he's unsure about this relationship. It might mean that he's lying to this girl -- and maybe to someone else in his life.  Or he might be just using this girl to feel young, and then running off when it starts to feel too much like a relationship.  Whatever the cause, Lala doesn't like it any more than we do.  \"If you're gonna be inconsistent, women we need to give them the boot, it's not OK.\"  Lala goes on to explain that the girl went to dinner with this older man and that man's friend before the New Year.  The girl had a few drinks at the bar because she was nervous.  \"So she gets a little too drunk at the bar she says, they get into a cab and she starts to take her clothes off in the cab.\"  The girl was making certain that the driver couldn't see her as she did this.  It did not go over well.  \"She started taking her pants off and he started reprimanding her and getting upset and made her feel really stupid.\"  Our first thought is that this girl, who's clearly feeling insecure in this relationship enough that she's anxious before dinner and then wants reassurance that this older man finds her sexy, should dump his ass.  Lala Kent, we're happy to say, feels the same way.  \"I'll tell you how I would react, first of all my p--sy is no longer yours to have fun with, you're a f--king asshole.\"  That's good advice.  Here comes the controversy:  \"You make me feel dumb, I'm not about that life; you can call me a homewrecker, you can call me a bitch, you can call me whatever you want, when you make me feel dumb, I'm wiping my hands clean.\"  To be clear, if a guy's calling a girl names in a way that she's not okay with, that's not any more okay than ridiculing a girl as \"stupid.\"  What this girl was doing sounds desperate, which suggests to us that this guy is standoffish and cold -- maybe even more like this in front of his friend.  That's no good for a relationship, folks.  If a guy isn't friendly or is only friendly sometimes, that means that he has his own emotional issues, and it's not your job to crack through the ice. Move on to a guy who can show you how much he appreciates you.  And if a guy makes you feel dumb -- or calls you ugly names or otherwise demeans you outside of consensual bedroom roleplay -- dump his ass at the curb. It's 2018 and awful guys don't deserve great girlfriends.",

Serena Williams and her husband Alexis Ohanian had a big reason to smile this weekend -- their daughter Olympia turned 1!  The Reddit co-founder took to Instagram to share an adorable snap of his little girl to commemorate the occasion.  \"1 year ago today, you changed our lives forever, @olympiaohanian my adventure princess,\" he wrote.  It's not the first time Ohanian has gushed about his sweet little daughter and sports icon wife. He's been Williams' biggest champion as she returned to tennis this year and made it all the way to the Wimbledon final earlier this summer.  He's also melted the internet with his modern take on successful women, what it means to be a supportive partner and more.  In an interview with \"GMA\" earlier this year, Ohanian said, \"There's probably a lot of guys who would feel threatened in a situation with a partner who is extremely talented and successful. It seems kind of absurd to me, though, because all of that success and all of that greatness is something that you should be championing.\"  And when it comes to the other lady in his life, his little Olympia, well he's your typical proud dad. So much so, that he and Serena have created an Insta account for her.  And though they spoil their little girl each and every day with love and support, Williams explained last week why there would be no birthday party for Olympia.  During a press conference for the U.S. Open, Williams revealed that \"Olympia doesn’t celebrate birthdays. We’re Jehovah’s Witnesses, so we don’t do that,\" according to People magazine.  Though Olympia didn't get a party, Williams has been a bastion of hope for all working and non-working mothers -- not only returning to and creating real change in tennis and the rules on how it handles motherhood -- but also posting about everyday motherhood and trying to create a supportive dialogue online.  Just last week, Williams wrote, \"Kids humble us. The other day on a flight home Olympia had so much energy and insisted on running up and down the aisle. When I finally got her to calm down and sit still, she threw up all over me and in the aisle. #ThisMama wants to remind all mothers the importance of supporting one another through the highs, lows, laughs and tears. Share your own stories of motherhood with hashtag #ThisMama. I’d love to hear them!\"  That post garnered half a million likes and thousands of comments from other moms dealing relating to her story.  Once again, Williams proves she's a champion on and off the court!",

Take away all the moral and ethical considerations you've had drummed into you since childhood, and what are you left with? A 105 lb. problem.\"  Advertisement:  Following a death, either accidental or deliberate, no matter how skilfully the responsible party covers it up, there remains the problem of disposing of the most obvious and most damning piece of evidence for the crime: the body itself. (There have been jurisdictions where no corpse means no murder.)  A well-designed Death Trap may include its own way to eliminate the victim's corpse, thus combining the two tropes.  There are numerous popular methods for doing this:  A common way to indicate that a bad guy is not to be messed with is if they have an original and well-thought-through method in place to entirely obliterate a human body if needed. This indicates either that they're Crazy-Prepared, or that it's something they frequently find themselves having to do.  Advertisement:  Pretty much any action movie with a significant body count won't even bother with this trope; the exception is if it's supposed to be taking place under The Masquerade, in which case The Men in Black may send in a Cleanup Crew to do the job.  See Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie, in which any post-mortem hijinks are the direct request of the deceased, and Of Corpse He's Alive, when someone tries to pretend a dead body... isn't.  Contrast Dead Guy on Display, when the body is deliberately put somewhere it will be seen, often to send a message to the person who finds it.  This is a Death Trope; spoilers ahoy.  Examples:  open/close all folders  Advertising  A Doritos ad has a man see his dog burying something, which he quickly recognizes as the family cat's collar. Then the dog is up in his face, growling, and pushes a bag of Doritos with a note reading \"You didn't see nuthin\" towards him. At the end of the ad, we hear the man's wife asking \"Have you seen the cat?\"; the man looks up and sees the dog, outside the door, another bag of Doritos in his mouth.  Anime and Manga  Comic Books  The EC Comics story \"Cold Cuts.\" Likewise in \"...And All Through the House\" wherein the matter is somewhat more pressing, due to the presence of a Serial Killer outside the house who our matricidal \"heroine\" can't simply call the police about.  The \"Kitchen Irish\" arc in Garth Ennis' The Punisher MAX has an old guy who used to do this for the old Irish mob - his method being cutting the body into lots and lots of little pieces. For example, he points out the importance of covering the entire work area with trash bags prior to cutting - as well as doing it naked so as not to catch evidence in one's clothing.  In both the comic and the film version of the Sin City story \"The Big Fat Kill,\" after Dwight and the girls of Old Town learn that the abusive scumbag that they just killed was a hero cop , they set about disposing of him and his buddies by having Dwight dump them into the Santa Yolanda Tar Pits. Things... don't go to plan.  , they set about disposing of him and his buddies by having Dwight dump them into the Santa Yolanda Tar Pits. Things... don't go to plan.

        "text": "Many people can only dream of the chance to sing their favorite artist's song right in their presence. For 12-year-old Victoria Anthony, that dream came true at Pink's concert in Vancouver on Saturday (May 12).  Back on May 1, Anthony shared a video of herself on Twitter directed to the \"Beautiful Trauma\" singer: \"when you come here, I really want to sing at your concert,\" she wrote. Anthony then gave a few examples of her incredible singing voice, including the hashtag #vicandpink in the caption to help gain traction and -- hopefully -- the attention of her idol.  After being picked up by Canadian news outlets, Pink recognized the young pop star in the making in the crowd at the show. While Anthony didn't get to go on stage, Pink did hand her the mic -- and was instantly floored.  Anthony belted out a flawless solo version of Pink's hit \"Perfect,\" drawing a roaring applause from the crowd and a stunned response from the singer. Judging by her reaction, it's safe to assume Pink thought Anthony was pretty \"perfect\" herself.  \"Thank you for that,\" the still-amazed Pink said after returning onstage. \"How do you follow that?\"  Watch Anthony give Pink a run for her money below, and see the video she tweeted that made it all happen.",

While she will be accompanied by close friends, it seems there is room for Brad.  ‘When Jen mentioned that she was planning to go skiing with friends in Aspen after New Year’s, a light bulb went off in Brad’s head,’ claims Star’s source. ‘He said he could fly over in his private jet and meet up with her there.  ‘He pointed out that they could even hit the slopes together, since no one would recognise them in their ski masks, goggles and helmets. Jen thought it was genius.  The magazine claims that Jen has booked a $10,000 a night chalet featuring multiple fireplaces and hot tubs.  ‘The trip is going to be a blast,’ claims the source, who adds, ‘I imagine Brad and Jen will steal private moments to they can have some emotional heart-to-hearts.’  Reps for both Brad and Jen have denied Star’s story, and Jen has long said how happy she is with husband Justin.",

ET spoke with the country superstars backstage at Rabobank Arena in Bakersfield, California, during their Soul2Soul World Tour on Saturday, just days ahead of their 21st wedding anniversary. The two tied the knot on Oct. 6, 1996, after meeting earlier that year when Hill opened up for McGraw during his Spontaneous Combustion Tour.  According to Hill, no anniversary gift is needed from her handsome husband.  \"He's good. He doesn't need to get me anything,\" Hill told ET's Keltie Knight. \"Honestly, do you, baby? He's good at giving gifts and making surprises.\"  Faith Hill Slays National Anthem at Stanley Cup Final, Tim McGraw Cheers Her On  Hill joked that as long as she doesn't have to exercise with her famously fit husband, it's all good.  \"That's the best gift ever,\" Hill cracked. \"That's amazing. I get to do that four-hour workout with you? No, thank you. That's my gift -- I don't have to do that workout with you.\"  On a more serious note, McGraw gushed about getting to see his wife perform every night, admitting he's still in awe of her.  \"For me, it's hearing her sing every night -- that's the best part about [the tour],\" McGraw said. \"Because she's not out there singing much... To see her up on stage, having a great time and just belting it out? I mean, I always say it: when I'm on stage with her, it's like NASCAR trying to keep up with an Indy car. She's just that good. So, to watch her sing and see what she does is pretty inspiring.\"  \"My hot wife, man,\" he sweetly added.  Even so, the two also have a sense of humor about enjoying their private time.  \"I'm going to go on a man vacation after this is over,\" McGraw said, responding to Dolly Parton's advice that the secret to her long marriage is not spending too much time together.  \"I need a girl vacation, actually,\" Hill added. \"I am surrounded by girls, but I love that. We have a great time in my dressing room.\"  Of course, McGraw said he stays clear of that area of the tour!  \"Yeah, I try to stay out of that dressing room,\" he noted. \"It's all girls in that dressing room.\"  Hill and McGraw are releasing their highly anticipated first joint album in November. For fans who can't get enough of the couple's tour, Showtime is airing behind-the-scenes footage of their tour as well as concert performances, premiering Nov. 17.  Faith Hill and Tim McGraw Release Steamy Music Video for 'Speak to a Girl' -- Watch!  Clearly, the couple is more in love than ever after more than two decades of marriage and raising three daughters together -- 20-year-old Gracie, 19-year-old Maggie and 15-year-old Audrey. Earlier this month, McGraw wished his wife a happy fiftieth birthday with a romantic Instagram message.  \"Happy birthday to the most beautiful girl in the world,\" McGraw wrote. \"You are the most remarkable person that has ever been in my life.... Our daughters could not have a better role model. I am truly in love with you more everyday. Can't wait to see what 'the rest of our life' has in store for us.\"  Watch the video below to see their cutest moments throughout the years.

The model took to Instagram early Monday morning to share a candid, emotional note about rapper 21 Savage, whom she’s been spotted spending time with in recent weeks.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “It’s pretty amazing waking up every morning feeling love like this,” she captioned a photo of the two in bed. “I’ve cried endlessly and been hurt a lot in my life, I’ve been abused, talked to like I wasn’t s—, been gaslighted and Slut shamed by men that I once loved and cared about. So I’m so thankful that God brought this amazing person in my life who genuinely has my back and is ready to ‘pull up’ to defend my honor by any means.”  “Maybe he’s just as broken as me and that’s why we’re perfect for each other,” she added. “But either way he’s not going anywhere and neither am I.”  Rose also shared a video of the two kissing and cuddling in the mirror.  “When he loves spoiling you but you got ur own money so you spoil him instead,” she wrote. “Ain’t nothin like that #thuglove.”  RELATED VIDEO: Does Amber Rose Want to Have More Kids With Ex-Husband Wiz Khalifa?  Over the weekend, Rose took to Instagram to share a clip from 21 Savage’s recent radio interview with The Real After Party on Real 92.3.  “She’s beautiful, right?” he said. “We’ve just been kicking it, man. She’s a real cool woman. She treats me like a king, so it is what it is. And no disrespect will be tolerated, at all. Keep your mouth closed, no hoes, no bitches, no nothing, ’cause I’m pulling up.”  When asked about the age difference between the two — Rose is 33 and Savage is 24 — the rapper said he was only younger “in age, not mentally.”  But that being said, he’s still learning a few things from her.  “She makes me do s— that I don’t normally do,” he explained. “Like take vitamins and drink water.”  FROM PEN: Wendy Williams’ Perfect Date Night Might Not Be What You Expect  Most recently, Rose was linked to Dancing with the Stars pro Val Chmerkovskiy. The two split in February after about five months of dating.",

        "text": "When Bella Hadid and The Weeknd broke up, you maybe sorta probs shed a tear. I mean, they were pretty damn cute. And when Abel seemingly moved on with Selena Gomez, people were still rooting for a Bella-and-The-Weeknd reunion.  This content is imported from {embed-name}. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  Anyway, it seems your inkling at a destined make-up has finally become a reality. Here are all of the biggest signs that Bella and The Weeknd are going to be a couple again...  1. They Took the Cutest Selfie While in NYC Together  The Weeknd and Bella Hadid were having a great time with one another as they hit the Big Apple. The Weeknd was playing at the Global Citizen Festival in Central Park and Bella was right there with him. He posted several pictures from a dinner they were both at together and even sneaked a selfie of the two of them at the end.  2. They Hit Up Kylie's 21st Birthday Together  Ain't no party like a Kardashian party and Bella took the perfect date for Kylie's big bash. Bella and The Weeknd were spotted together at the party and there are plenty of cute pics of the two of them together to prove it.  This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  Bella and The Weeknd were also spotted together in Chicago for Lollapalooza, where The Weeknd was headlining. Bella was in the crowd supporting her beau and even sang along to some of his biggest hits.  This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  3. Sources Say They're Back Together  According to a source from E!, the couple is \"exclusively dating and are in a great place.\" The source went on to say, \"Abel realized once he started dating around, that he actually is still in love with Bella, and they reconnected.\" Aw!  Apparently, no one close to the couple is surprised they reunited. \"Everyone around them always knew it was a matter of time, and knew the undeniable bond that they had when they were together,\" said the source. In light of this summer's crazy engagement circus...let the proposal countdown begin!  4. Bella Called The Weeknd Her Muse  The two are certainly getting very cozy together lately and while they haven't officially confirmed their relationship, Bella is not shying away from rumors. She posted videos of her and The Weeknd as they walked past an art installation.  The Weeknd was featured in the last one on her Instagram story and she captioned it, \"muse forever.\" If that doesn't mean their back together, then we don't know what does.  Instagram  5. They were spotted together in Tokyo.  It looks like it's finally happening as the couple were spotted taking in the sights in Tokyo, Japan together. Fans took videos of Bella and The Weeknd as they walked out of a store and checked out arcades throughout Tokyo.  They don't seem to be hiding their rekindled relationship after The Weeknd posted a video featuring Bella on his Instagram story.  Bella still hasn't featured The Weeknd on her page, but it's only a matter of time before she confirms they're back together again.  6. Bella Posted The Weeknd's Lyrics on Instagram  It looks like Bella just can't get The Weekend out of her mind and it's even more obvious after she posted a new photo of herself from her trip to Italy with some of his lyrics.  This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  The lyrics \"as long as u know that when I land ur mine\" are from his song \"Pretty\" from his first album, Kiss Land.  It looks like The Weekend enjoyed the throwback lyrics from his ex as he liked the photo, even though he doesn't currently follow her on Instagram.  Instagram  It looks like The Weeknd took back the like as it seems like his like doesn't appear anymore, even after searching through the photos likes. What's more interesting though is how he found the photo in the first place. Looks like The Weeknd might be looking at Bella's page more than he would like us to think.  7. Bella and The Weeknd spend a few days cuddled up inside his mansion.  You don't need to be in the CIA to solve this mystery: Where did Bella Hadid and Abel spend a recent weekend? Well, they spent it together at his mansion, of course! How do we know? Instagram tells no lies.  Abel posted a pic of him standing on the balcony of his stunning mansion with his two dogs looking up lovingly at him. Obvi, this pic is too far away to be taken from a selfie stick.

So who was behind the camera for this shot?  Well, that...",

        "text": "For most actresses on red carpets, what you’re wearing is less an expression of who you are and more an expression of what you’re worth. The very act of getting ready for an award show can be a masochist’s checklist of one’s value: Airbrush your arms so that they look more toned. Check. Get a peel or injection to make sure your face looks flawless. Check. Lose bloat by eating only before 6 p.m. and stop drinking all liquid 24 hours before the big day to send your metabolism into shock. Check. Prepping for award shows can be a weeklong marathon in dread, resulting in a one-time portrayal of improbable beauty.  You’re also often assigned a look that doesn’t reflect who you truly are but reflects what a runway wants you to be. Platform high heels and frilly dresses and a clutch purse made from the skin of dead baby lizards. I’ve spent the better part of my two decades as an actress accumulating more designer high heels than most could ever dream of, only to hit my 30s and realize I hated wearing most of them and always had. Years ago when I was nominated for a Golden Globe for best actress in a television drama, I had a full anxiety attack after the dress fitting, even though I had found a beautiful dress that fit me nicely. I found myself in my car, the air-conditioning on full blast, sobbing into my steering wheel. The anxiety I was feeling wasn’t about the dress itself. It was about the fulfillment of the obligations of the dress.  Not all actresses loathe getting ready for award shows, though. For some, the act of dressing up is a joy that comes quite naturally. For example, one of my best friends is the actress Blake Lively, who has such extraordinary taste in fashion and clothing. I often find myself texting her to get advice on what to wear to an event where I know there will be cameras present. She is always helpful and thoughtful about what will look best on me, a favor I can’t ever seem to do for myself no matter how hard I try. In recent years, I’ve become far more comfortable in my skin and on red carpets, and I’ve had the good fortune of working with stylists such as Karla Welch and Sarah Slutsky who don’t dress a woman’s body as if it’s a tree hungry for ornaments, but rather an individual, unique body with its own sweet purpose and design.  But getting dressed does still involve obligations. We actresses are not just modeling clothing when we walk a red carpet on award show night. We are modeling a kind of behavior. We are speaking in a coded language to other women — even young girls — that says: The way I look and what I wear and how I wear it is the standard for women. What is being worn is not an exception. It is the rule. You must dress a certain way and look a certain way if you want to be valued as a woman, no matter what you do for a living or who you are. We never intend for this to be the message we are sending with what we wear, but often it is the perceived one, whether we like it or not.  I have often wondered what would happen if actresses stood in solidarity with a singular, powerful choice for just one night. What would that even look like? To uniformly reject our lifelong objectification and say: Enough. We belong to no one. We are a canvas for no expression other than the words our voices have chosen to speak.",

Working with a trainer can actually be a life-changing experience, especially if you’re someone for whom working out is scary or unpleasant. A good trainer can teach you how to actually enjoy exercise and do it in a sustainable way. And rational exercise can certainly have a positive impact on your life. But, just to be clear, physical fitness is not happiness and personal trainers are not therapists.I know it may be confusing given that every weight-loss reality show casts the trainers as demigods or father figures, capable of healing all your psychic wounds by shouting, “GIVE ME TEN MORE!” But yeah, your trainer is not your social worker.Will gets paired with celebrity trainer Gunnar Peterson. Will wanders into his first workout session moaning about Kyle and how he drove him away with his heinous chub. (His goal, by the way, is to go from being a “bear” to a “muscle cub,” both of which are terms used to describe body types in the gay male community. As a not-male, not-gay person, I’m not going to get preachy over these terms and their use within the context of this show — but I sure hope someone does.) Losing weight, he is sure, will help get Kyle back — or else get revenge on him for leaving? It’s unclear. Will lays his sob story at Peterson’s feet, and Peterson at least has the gumption to say, “I don’t care.” But that doesn’t stop Will from continuing to overshare about his breakup and all his totally valid hurt feelings. Core strength is rad, but Will clearly needs someone to talk this out with, and — say it with me — your trainer is not your therapist.Nor are they your dietitian, by the way (unless they are an actual registered dietitian, of course, or a PhD in nutrition science — which most trainers aren’t). Stephanie gets paired with Luke Milton, who seems like a super friendly guy and may even be a good trainer. Sure, I couldn’t find his credentials anywhere, but he is quite ripped, not to mention Australian. So. That’s something. I really wanted to like him because he is literally the only person on this show — slash, in Stephanie’s life — who’s being nice to her. But then he prescribes the following nutrition program to her: “If it’s had a life, it’s good for ya.” By this, he means plants, meat, and fish, which is fine. Really, I wish he’d just left food out of it because he’s not a nutrition professional. But, at the very least, I wish he’d been a little more clear on this point rather than relying on his very poetic generalization. It sort of sounds like a cannibal diet.",

The sisters have seemingly been left unimpressed by the rapper's continual stream of tweets over the last two days, following a year-long absence from the platform.  6 Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian have cut ties with Kanye West on Twitter after pro-Trump tweets Credit: Rex Features  6 Kanye, mocked up as Trump, has been criticised for his bromance with the US President  They're not the only high profile names to boycott Kanye online, with Kanye's former collaborators Drake, Nicki Minaj, and Rihanna joining Justin Bieber, Harry Styles and Kendrick Lamar all unfollowing the controversial star.  The online exodus hasn't been missed by eagle-eyed social media users, with one writing on Twitter: \"Zayn & Harry both unfollowed Kanye on Twitter. Kings.  Another said :\"Rihanna, Drake, Katy, Ariana, Kendrick, Zayn, Nicki etc. all unfollowed Kanye 💀 he really ended himself :(.\"  While a third added: \"Khloe, Kylie and Kourtney all unfollowed Kanye.

Calling Trump \"my brother,\" he claimed they both have \"dragon energy\". The President replied saying the rapper was \"very cool\".  6 Kanye and Trump pose together at Trump Tower the day after the 2016 US election Credit: AP:Associated Press  6 Kanye has never hidden his love for the US President and even embraced him at Trump Tower Credit: AFP or licensors  Their most recent display of affection follows years of social media appreciation between Trump and the President.  The loved-up posts were rumoured to have cost the rapper nine million Twitter follows, but the claims have been proved false after Twitter confirmed Kanye still boasts around 27million followers.  Kanye, 40, tweeted: \"You don’t have to agree with Trump but the mob can’t make me not love him.\"  He also shared a picture of a Make America Great Again cap and wrote: \"My MAGA hat is signed\", followed by a string of fire emojis.  You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought. — ye (@kanyewest) April 25, 2018  Thank you Kanye, very cool! https://t.co/vRIC87M21X — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 25, 2018  Kanye's wife Kim Kardashian defended her husband by tweeting: \"To the media trying to demonise my husband let me just say this... your commentary on Kanye being erratic & his tweets being disturbing is actually scary.  \"So quick to label him as having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive is not fair.\"  I love when people have their own ideas. You don't have to be allowed anymore. Just be.    Love who you want to love. That's free thought. I'm not even political. I'm not a democrat or a republican — ye (@kanyewest) April 25, 2018  my wife just called me and she wanted me to make this clear to everyone. I don't agree with everything Trump does. I don't agree 100% with anyone but myself. — ye (@kanyewest) April 25, 2018  The rapper also took potshots at Obama during the tweeting flurry, stating that nothing changed in Chicago during his presidency.  Combating backlash from anti-Trump protesters he also shared a picture of a post by Chance The Rapper which read: \"Black people don't have to be Democrats.\"  Obama was in office for eight years and nothing in Chicago changed. — ye (@kanyewest) April 25, 2018  Kanye continued that he loved free thinkers and showed alt-right supporter Peter Thiel.  The dad-of-three tweeted: \"I'm so happy to hear that Peter Thiel would like to take a meeting. I feel very optimistic about the future.\"  Thiel is a controversial figure in American politics as he backs the alt-right and funded the Hulk Hogan case against Gawker Media for publishing a video of Hogan having sex.

        "text": "In 2007, an L.A. family's unvarnished docuseries launched on E!, and reality television, female body image, social media and, above all, the economy of celebrity were forever changed. Now the stars and producers of the megafranchise (nine TV spinoffs, hundreds of millions of dollars earned) reveal the secrets of its improbable explosion into the zeitgeist.  Wearing curve-hugging black workout pants and a white tank top, Kim Kardashian perches on a couch in the media room of her newly renovated Bel Air estate and sips Pedialyte through a straw. The makeup-free 36-year-old appears almost normal — certainly not like a mogul who, according to Forbes, banked $45.5 million the past year from a brand she built on self-­aggrandizement, shameless product peddling and nude selfies. At the epicenter of this unprecedented trajectory remains E!'s Keeping Up With the Kardashians, a living record of her happily debauched family — Kourtney, 38; Khloe, 33; Rob, 30; Kendall, 21; and Kylie, 20; as well as matriarch Kris, 61, and her ex Caitlyn Jenner, 67 (who in 2015 transitioned from Bruce). On Sept. 24, a 90-minute special will celebrate the series' 10th unapologetic year. It's a head-scratching milestone for a show that, at its conception, offered viewers little more than a voyeuristic lens into the lives of a celebrity-adjacent family — but quickly became the mother ship for all their product extensions and the platform through which Kris and her five daughters ushered in the era of the reality celebrity as a brand.  Keeping Up With the Kardashians now airs in 167 countries, boasts nine spinoffs to date and has ranked as E! Entertainment's top-rated series since 2010. And while it peaked in 2011 with 10.5 million viewers over two nights for Kim's fairy-tale wedding to Kris Humphries (they divorced after 72 days), it still averages north of 2.1 million every Sunday in its 13th season. In 2015, E! agreed to a reported $80 million deal to keep the family through season 14. But that's a pittance compared to the fashion and lifestyle empire they've built from one boutique in the Valley. With a combined social media reach of 700 million-plus followers and five insanely profitable apps, the family mints millions from a hodgepodge of endorsement deals, paid appearances and can't-stay-in-stock products. And it all grew from a show that opened its pilot with these prophetic words from Kim (already notorious for the sex tape she made with her ex, Ray J, that was made public in 2007): \"I hate you all.\"  As much as the family reveals on the show, on red carpets and on Instagram, one mystery remains. How the hell did this happen?  Kris Jenner (star, executive producer) Before the show, I was managing Bruce's speaking career and personal appearances.  Kim Kardashian (star, executive producer) I was going to [Pierce College], and after school I would go work the cash register at our store, Dash. This all happened when I was 27 …  Kendall Jenner (star) That's so crazy because I'm not even 27. We've lived the same amount of time of the same thing, but I'm not even the age you were when you started.  Ryan Seacrest (executive producer) Everyone was talking about The Osbournes, and I said to my development executive Eliot [Goldberg], \"Let's try to find something in this world and take it to E!\"  Kris One night, Deena Katz [casting director for Dancing With the Stars] came over for dinner and life was swirling around, and she said, \"This is a reality show — I think you should really talk to Ryan Seacrest.\" So I did.  Seacrest Kris told me what she envisioned, and I said, \"Let's send a crew to your house and tape some stuff and then we'll take a look at it.\" Then I realized I didn't have a crew; I didn't even have a camera. I had Eliot buy a camera, and he went and shot them. He called me after and said, \"I think we have something special.\"  Kourtney Kardashian (star, executive producer) We had talked to producers about doing a show about the three of us running the store, Dash, where Khloe and I would do the day-to-day, and Kim would come in as a stylist. It didn't go anywhere.  •••  In Caitlyn Jenner's memoir, The Secrets of My Life, released earlier this year, she implies that the series may actually have been her brainchild. She writes, \"The house is awash in puberty and adolescence and young adulthood and two parents with very different styles. It seems to me something is there for television. … Kris says she is the one who came up with the idea …\" Jenner declined to participate in this story.  Kris It's so absurd. I'm not sure what the motivation was for her to say something like that. Maybe somebody should remind her that it's called Keeping Up With the Kardashians.  Ted Harbert (then-CEO of E! Networks) Just like anybody else, I knew of the family through [O.J. Simpson attorney] Robert Kardashian. There was a bit of the stuff with Kim hanging around Paris Hilton and, of course, the fun with Ray J [who made a sex tape with Kim]. That was...",

        "text": "Judd Apatow has his daughter Maude’s back following her directorial debut during the Santa Barbara International Film Festival tonight. The 20-year-old took to Instagram to announce that her short film had been screened at the SBFF.  Judd took to Instagram to congratulate his daughter as well as the co-director, Olivia Rosen Bloom, whom he also linked on the social media platform.  Apatow – who is known for hits such as Knocked Up and Funny People – wrote alongside a picture of him and his daughter standing together.  As you may know, Maude comes from a line of entertainment juggernauts including her father, Judd, as well as her mother, Leslie Mann, who is most known for playing in Judd’s movies.  She made an appearance in the 40-Year-Old Virgin. During his 2007 film, Knocked Up, his youngest daughter, Iris, made a short cameo and even portrayed Leslie’s daughter in Funny People and This Is 40.  Maude has big shoes to fill. In fact, during an interview with Nylon in 2016, she thanked her father for his advice and took the wisdom from women such as Lena Dunham and Amy Schumer.  Maude said her father always told her to “write for yourself,” because when a person is an actor, they rarely have much control over what happens in a film.  Maude said Lena and Amy are both involved in writing, acting, directing, and editing, so it inspired her to become an all-star producer in the Hollywood’s sphere.  Advertisement  It appears as though the daughter of Apatow is just getting started, and we can’t wait to see what she has in store. Her introduction into film-making comes at a turbulent time in the entertainment capital of America, considering the wave of sexual assault allegations to flourish in recent months.",

Few celebs are as private as George, 56, and Amal Clooney, 39. So when a photographer recently got onto their property in Lake Como, Italy to snap photos of their twin babies, Ella and Alexander, it drove the movie star right up the wall! Not only is George considering pressing charges against Voici, the French magazine that acquired the images, our insider says the incident has him terrified and considering scaling up security for his family! Does this mean the world-famous couple are about to turn their home into Fort Knox? Head here for images of this picture-perfect couple!  “This invasion of privacy has set off a huge chain reaction for George,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “He’s now planning to overhaul his security, and not just at his Lake Como home. He’s got five properties and he’s looking to beef up security on all of them. He’s always been fairly blasé about security, even when he had a full-on stalker, he was never actually afraid. But now that he’s a father everything has changed.” Parenthood has certainly brought about another side of the Suburbicon director!  Our insider went on to explain that the photographer’s trespassing has George fearing for his one-and-a-half-month-old children and anxious over what could happen to them. “He’s thinking in worst case scenarios, he just can’t help himself. He’s horrified that someone was able to get on his property and get that close to his babies without him knowing. He’s planning to spend whatever it takes to make sure it never happens again.” Hopefully George and his gorgeous better half will be able to move past this troubling incident without living in fear!

        "text": "Pamela Anderson has spoken of her 'romantic' connection with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.  The Canadian-American actress, 51, said Assange is one of her favorite people in an interview with Harvey Levin that aired on Fox News on Sunday night.  Describing him as 'imperfect', the former Baywatch star said: 'He's definitely an interesting person and there's definitely a romantic kind of connection 'cause it's a romantic struggle.  'We have this closeness… he's not close to people like he is to me.'  Scroll down for video  Pamela Anderson spoke of her 'romantic' connection with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in an interview that aired on Sunday night  Anderson, who is in a relationship with French footballer Adil Rami, said she had first met Assange to figure out how to be a 'more effective' activist – and brought him vegan food.  Since then, she says she has visited Assange a number of times at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.  'Now it's a tradition that I bring him vegan food every time I see him, and I see him a lot,' she added.  They have deep conversations about everything from the Bible to animal rights and jealousy, she said.  Now, the pair are planning to work together to create 'career activists' by choosing 10 activists from across the globe and pay their salaries for 10 years, she said.  Anderson says she has visited Assange a number of times at the Ecuadorian embassy in London (above)  She previously spoke about her concerns for Assange's health and well-being after Ecuador announced it had taken away Assange's Internet access and visitor privileges.  The Australian was undergoing 'a slow, painful death' at the hands of the US and UK, Anderson told the New York Post in March.  Last month, Ecuador's president said it was in talks with Britain over Assange's fate.  Assange has been holed up at Ecuador's embassy in London since 2012 when he was granted political asylum.  'The issue of Mr. Assange is being treated with the British government and I understand that we have already established contact with Mr. Assange's lawyers so we can find a way out,' Ecuador President Lenin Moreno told Spanish daily newspaper El Pais.  Anderson, who is in a relationship with French footballer Adil Rami, said she had first met Assange to figure out how to be a 'more effective' activist  'Mr. Assange has been in this situation for over five years and we have to find a way out for him.  'A way out that defends his rights, mainly his right to life, and which at the same time can give Ecuador the possibility to not have what, without a doubt, represents a problem for our country.'  Assange, 47, sought refuge in Ecuador's London embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden to face sexual assault allegations, which he denies.  The Australian computer programmer claims the accusations were politically motivated and could lead to his extradition to the United States to face imprisonment over WikiLeaks's publication of secret US military documents and diplomatic cables in 2010.  Assange has been holed up at Ecuador's embassy in London since 2012 when he was granted political asylum  Swedish authorities dropped their investigations last year, but British authorities still want to arrest him for breaching bail conditions.  US intelligence agencies have also concluded that WikiLeaks co-ordinated with Russian intelligence to release hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election campaign.  Last year, Attorney General Jeff said arresting Assange was a 'priority.'  In March, Ecuador cut off Assange's ability to communicate with the outside world after he broke a 2017 promise to not interfere in other countries' affairs while in the mission.  Assange particularly drew the ire of Ecuador by angering the Spanish government with his support for separatist leaders in Spain's Catalonia region who sought to secede last year.  Moreno said the 'ideal' solution would involve Assange accepting a 'penalty' for having breached British bail conditions and then be 'extradited to a country where he does not face any danger.'",

        "text": "Melania Trump. Is she trapped? A reluctant first lady? Or is she poised, polished and a quiet, but supportive, first lady? Who is the real Melania? Very few, at least among those who are speaking publicly, will say. “I’m very strong. People, they don’t really know me. People think and talk about me like, ‘Oh, Melania. Oh, poor Melania.’ Don’t feel sorry for me. Don’t feel sorry for me. I can handle everything.” But as Donald Trump’s presidency has progressed, the first lady has become a versatile avatar, her image split sharply down political lines. In one version of the public imagination, Melania is unhappy. She dislikes her husband and disagrees with his policies. She may even be mulling a divorce. This Melania has shown up on late-night TV and in tabloids. “You’re beautiful, dutiful Melania. I can’t take it anymore.” Then there’s the other version of Melania, painted by conservative media as confident, fashion forward, graceful and adored. “I have been so impressed with, not just her quiet dignity, as you brought up, but also just this diplomatic use of fashion.” This version is closer to the official portrayal of Melania. Through her spokespeople, the first lady says she is supportive of her husband and focused on raising their son, Barron. “I support my husband 100 percent. But we have a 9-year-old son together, Barron. And I’m raising him.” She says she prefers to take a back seat to her husband, to keep his place in the limelight. It’s not the first time Melania’s been in the public eye. “You spin, baby, you spin.” She’s a former model and jewelry designer. “I love when idea comes to life. And I study architecture and design and it’s something very creative for me.” “I’m very passionate about what I design, and there are some beautiful pieces.” When they got together in the late 1990s, the Trumps say their chemistry was instant. “We were both at the same party and that’s how we met. He came to me...” “Like her right away?” “I went crazy.” Melania and Donald became synonymous with the New York social scene. “They’ve stood did together for a number of years now. New Yorkers have come to know them as a very solid couple.” And in 2005, they married. “Hi, fans. I’m going to Metropolitan Gala.” In the following years, Melania’s social media posts focused on fashion, travel, fitness and spending time with family. Now as the first lady, next to one of the most outspoken presidents in recent history, Melania’s silence has taken on a life of its own. “The most important thing is just to be you. That’s the end.”",

The reality star responded to a fan Friday who pointed out the buzz circulating that she was going to give her baby the floral-inspired name.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Rose is so cute but no that’s not on my list,” Kardashian replied on Twitter.  The rumors likely came out of the fact that Kardashian, 33, frequently posts photos of luxurious rose arrangements to her social media — usually in shades of pink and white.

On Thursday, Kardashian narrowed it down even further, telling one fan on Twitter, “I think im going with a T.”  “@khloekardashian do you have a name picked out for your sweet baby girl yet?” another fan asked the Revenge Body star in early March.  “NO!!!

        "text": "BBMAS Drake Sets Single-Year Record, Celine Dion & Cher Shine at 2017 Billboard Music Awards  Drake stole the show at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in more ways than one, taking home 13 honors, surpassing Adele's mark as the artist with the most BBMA wins in one night, delivering a fiery performance in the middle of the famous Bellagio fountain and, maybe, getting himself a date after hitting on co-host Vanessa Hudgens during his acceptance speech for winning Top Billboard 200 Album for Views.  Watch  \"It's crazy that we're all here on earth for a limited amount of time, and we gotta show love while we're here,\" he said on stage midway through the telecast, before getting straight to the point: \"Vanessa Hudgens, you look incredible tonight.\" (Hudgens acknowledged that shortly afterward by asking if she was on the invite list for Drake's afterparty.)  By then, Drake had already racked up 12 BBMAs -- 10 in the pre-telecast categories, and one earlier in the show for Top Male Artist -- on his way to a record-breaking 13 victories, which he achieved with the evening's final honor, Top Artist, to overtake Adele's previous record of 12 in 2012. It's an impressive number for an artist who utterly dominated 2016, shattering streaming records over and over again with the success of his album Views and its monster single \"One Dance\" featuring WizKid and Kyla.  \"Life is like toilet paper,\" he said while accepting his final award. \"Either you're on a roll, or taking sh-t from assholes.\"  Cher was presented with the prestigious Icon Award and rolled back the years with a high-powered performance of her iconic songs \"Believe\" and \"If I Could Turn Back Time\" -- sporting, fittingly, completely different looks for each performance -- a day after her 71st birthday. \"I've wanted to do what I do since I was four years old, and I've been doing it for 53 years,\" she said with a humble air during her acceptance speech. \"I think luck has so much to do with with my success... I think it was mostly luck and a little bit of something thrown in.\"  Drake also won Top Hot 100 Artist, Top Billboard 200 Artist and Top Rap Artist, and took home awards for song sales, song streams and several rap and R&B categories on his way to lucky 13. Beyoncé earned Top Female Artist, Zayn was awarded Top New Artist and Blake Shelton (Country), Beyoncé (R&B), Twenty One Pilots (Rock), Juan Gabriel (Latin), The Chainsmokers (Dance/Electronic) and Lauren Daigle (Christian) and Kirk Franklin (Gospel) won top artist honors in their respective genres. Twenty One Pilots and Beyoncé were also big winners on the night, with five BBMAs apiece, while The Chainsmokers earned four.  The show spent most of its three hours, fittingly, on performances and awards rather than hosting gimmicks, with 15 performances that ran the gamut of genres from hip-hop to pop to dance to rock to country. Nicki Minaj opened the show with a star-studded medley that included her Remy Ma diss track \"No Frauds,\" which she performed with Lil Wayne, David Guetta's \"Light My Body Up,\" Jason Derulo's \"Swalla\" and her own \"Regret In Your Tears,\" bringing out each superstar in turn. Camila Cabello and Miley Cyrus both delivered the live debuts of their new singles -- Cabello's first solo songs since leaving Fifth Harmony, an emotional-yet-brief \"I Have Questions\" and a heated-up \"Crying In the Club,\" and Cyrus' country-tinged comeback release \"Malibu\" -- while Lorde (\"Green Light,\" performed as if at a goofy and awkward karaoke night), Sam Hunt (\"Body Like a Back Road\") and John Legend (\"Surefire\"), who was then joined by Florida Georgia Line for a surprise joint rendition of FGL's \"H.O.L.Y.,\" all chipped in with memorable performances.  Hudgens was a natural in her first year as co-host alongside veteran BBMAs host Ludacris, and their monologue would have had her in the headlines regardless of Drake's unabashed flirting. In hyping the performances to come, Hudgens showed off both her pipes and rapping skills with a cappella versions of Celine Dion's \"Power of Love\" and Nicki Minaj's verse from \"Monster,\" impressing both Luda and the crowd in the process.  Speaking of Dion, the diva performed her iconic song \"My Heart Will Go On\" 20 years after its initial prominence as the main song from the blockbuster Leonardo DiCaprio-Kate Winslet film Titanic, navigating the challenging track effortlessly and earning an extended standing ovation. (Read Billboard's oral history of the song right here.) It was easily one of the standout moments of the night, and impressive in its emotion and vocal dexterity.  Diddy also took the stage to pay tribute to The Notorious B.I.G. on what would have been the rapper's 45th birthday and debuted the trailer for his upcoming Bad Boy Records documentary Can't Stop, Won't Stop. \"It all started with the Notorious B.I.G.,\" Diddy said, referencing Bad Boy's creation and the 500 million albums it sold over the past 20-plus years. \"Big sold over 25 million records worldwide;...",

Smith launched a tweetstorm criticizing the HFPA and the nominations process Tuesday, saying she was \"discouraged,\" and accusing the nominating body of not having watched the movie.  \"Girls Trip was one of the most successful films this summer & Tiff was hands down the funniest person on screen in 2017 and we couldn't get eyes on the film or a press conference. How could a nom happen & how much more critical acclaim must a movie have to simply get a screening?\" she tweeted.  However, a source with knowledge of the situation not authorized to comment publicly confirmed to USA TODAY that there was an official screening on July 18 for the HFPA, and members were also invited to the premiere.  Haddish's awards season chances looked golden after the breakout star earned a supporting actress win from the New York Film Critics Circle and Critics' Choice Awards nominations for Girls Trip. Yet, those precursor honors didn't translate into any Globes nods.  Golden Globes 2018 biggest snubs:'Wonder Woman,' Tiffany Haddish, 'The Big Sick'  More Tiffany Haddish:10 of our favorite breakout stars of 2017  Pinkett pointed to Hollywood's long history of excluding women and people of color from its highest echelons, explaining that Haddish's snub goes beyond just \"racism.\"  \"And I dare not invalidate all the many journalists and people from all walks of life who have supported this movie by defining the issue as simply... racism,\" she wrote, naming The Big Sick and Get Out as two other films starring people of color that were largely ignored at the Globes nominations. \"Hollywood has systems in place that must learn to expand its concepts of race, gender equality and inclusion in regard to its perceptions of art across the board.\"    ",

The initiative is a way to honor the victims of the Route 91 Harvest Festival shooting.  It's unclear where the gold pin initiative started, but each number carries its own significance: 851 is for the 851 people injured during the shooting on Oct. 1 at the 2017 Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas, Nev.; 58 is for the 58 people who were killed during the tragedy; and 1 represents unity.  \"You are with us every single night in every single town,\" explains a card about the gold pin initiative. \"#FansFirst #VegasStrong\"  Fans can expect to see many 2018 ACM Awards attendees donning the gold pins, both on the red carpet and during the awards ceremony. Rising star Jillian Jacqueline writes on Instagram that she is \"proud\" to be part of the movement.  Remembering the Victims of the Route 91 Harvest Festival Shooting  \"We can’t go back in time, but we can move forward with resilience. and the healing power of music is going to prove itself again and again,\" Jacqueline writes. \"Life is a precious thing that goes by all too fast ... and when someone’s is taken from them too soon, i can only believe that it’s our responsibility to lift their memory up with love as much as we can.\"  The 2018 ACM Awards ceremony will include an onstage tribute to the victims of the Route 91 Harvest Festival shooting as well. The show's producers have indicated that the moment will open the awards show, and that they worked with Jason Aldean -- who was onstage at Route 91 when the shooting began -- to put the tribute together. During rehearsals for the ceremony, Aldean and Thomas Rhett visited with survivors of the shooting.  The 2018 ACM Awards are set to air live on CBS beginning at 8PM ET. Reba McEntire will be hosting the show.  The Boot will be staying up late covering the most buzzed-about winners, fashion and moments at the 2018 ACM Awards.

Inside Angelina Jolie's Secret Plan To Woo Heartthrob Hemsworth It was 'no accident' the famous pair were seated together at the Golden Globes.  A year-and-a-half after her divorce from Brad Pitt, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal Angelina Jolie has her eyes set on Hollywood’s hottest hunk — Chris Hemsworth!  The A-list actress is said to be begging her team to cast her in a movie alongside the Thor heartthrob after she was seen cozying up to him at the Golden Globes.  A source tells Radar it was “no accident” that Jolie, 42, was seated next to Hemsworth, 34, at the star-studded event. “She really admires his work and thinks he’s a fantastic actor, so she’d like to star together in a movie in the near future.”  “Angie is preparing to get back in front of the camera and would love to work on another action film, with Chris as her hunky leading man!” snitches the informant.  While the couple would undoubtedly make a good paring for a movie together, sources claim “the whole thing is pretty fishy.”  “It hasn’t gone unnoticed that Angie swoons whenever she’s in Chris’ presence, and there’s growing talk she’s using this as a way of getting closer to him.”  As Radar previously reported exclusively, Angie was most recently linked to 38-year-old Cambodian rapper and filmmaker praCH Ly — who is a superstar in his homeland — after being introduced by their mutual friend Loung Ung.  But it appears she’s already moved on from Ly as she has her eyes set on Hemsworth!  We pay for juicy info! Do you have a story for RadarOnline.com?

Sex and the City’s Willie Garson Throws Major Shade at Kim Cattrall as He Wades Into Movie Controversy: 'Because I'm Toxic'  Sex and the City‘s Willie Garson is adding his voice to reports that Kim Cattrall was behind the cancellation of Sex and the City 3.  Garson, who played Carrie Bradshaw’s friend Stanford Blanch in the series and subsequent two films, implied in a tweet on Wednesday that Cattrall wasn’t being entirely truthful about her claims that she never wanted to do a third film.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Dear fans, because I’m ‘toxic’, I’m going to negotiate a contract for 6 months, not come to terms, then say I never wanted to do it anyway,” he wrote.  Cattrall, who played Samantha on the popular HBO series has previously slammed reports that her demands led to the movie being shelved.  But a source close to the situation maintains to PEOPLE that Cattrall was a key factor in the movie being shelved. “Kim is trying to distract from what this is about — which is this: Kim killed the movie,” says the source. Cattrall has claimed that she has refused to board a third film since 2016, but the source tells PEOPLE she “was negotiating as recently as this summer” to join the movie. (Studio Warner Bros. has not commented.)  A second source also told PEOPLE that the cast “have had their issues over the years.”  Image zoom Craig Blankenhorn/Hbo/Darren Star Prods./Kobal/REX/Shutterstock  During a sitdown with Piers Morgan for ITV‘s series Life Stories, Cattrall, 61, said that she had refused to board the movie multiple times throughout the past year. She also bashed reports by DailyMailTV that claimed the third movie was shelved because of Cattrall’s “outrageous demands” to the studio to produce other movies she had in development.  “It’s quite extraordinary to get any kind of negative press about something that I’ve been saying for almost a year of ‘no’ that I’m demanding or a diva,” Cattrall said, according to the Daily Mail. “The answer was always no and a respectful, firm, no.”  “I never asked for any money, I never asked for any projects,” she continued. “To be thought of as some kind of diva is absolutely ridiculous.”  Cattrall then called out Parker — who would have been a producer on the film: “And this is really where I take to task the people from Sex and the City and specifically Sarah Jessica Parker in that I think she could have been nicer.”  RELATED: Sarah Jessica Parker Admits She Begged to Get out of ‘Sex and the City’ – Before Falling for Carrie  Cattrall and Parker’s reps have not responded to a request for comment.  Parker told Extra that Sex and the City 3 had a “beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story.”  “It’s not just disappointing that we don’t get to tell the story and have that experience, but more so for that audience that has been so vocal in wanting another movie,” she said.  Rumors that Samantha, Carrie, Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) were reuniting for a new film — which would follow 2008’s Sex and the City and 2010’s Sex and the City 2 —had long swirled before Parker’s announcement that the movie was off.  Parker wasn’t the only one feeling regret for Sex and the City’s end. Garson also previously tweeted that he was “disappointed” for the crew members who counted on working on the third installment.",

It’s believed Brad and Jen – who rekindled their fairytale romance after Jen’s marriage to Justin Theroux ended earlier this year – have been on the rocks in recent weeks because of Brad’s controversial relationship with Neri Oxman.  Last month reports surfaced that Brad had been caught getting cosy with the beautiful young architect, leaving Jen feeling insecure and concerned about their relationship.  Added to this is the fact Jen’s also under immense pressure during her bitter divorce from Justin Theroux, from whom she split in February, and it’s a difficult time for the actress.  ‘She’s under a lot of stress at the moment, so... all these questions about a surprise pregnancy are the last thing she wants,’ adds the source.  ‘Not only is she going through a messy divorce, she’s having problems with Brad. Ever since his friendship with Neri went public, she’s been doubting their relationship and wondering whether he is serious about building a new life with her.  ‘Brad is desperately trying to convince Jen that they’re just friends and that he’s committed but Jen just isn’t buying it.  ‘She’s very wary of him – after all, it feels like only yesterday that he cheated on her with Angelina and destroyed their marriage.  ‘While Jen is hopeful that she and Brad will work things out, she’s also preparing herself for the fact that she may have to raise this baby alone. She has always said that she would be happy to be a single mother if that’s how everything worked out,’ reveals the insider.  After her split from Justin earlier, People magazine reported that having kids was always part of her plan during their marriage.  ‘She had been sad it never happened,’ a source told the magazine. ‘But it never consumed her.’  But since their separation, Jen has realised that her window for having a child is closing fast, making this baby buzz a beautiful surprise.  ‘This could be a dream come true for her, and she’s not going to let troubles with Brad ruin it. If she winds up alone, that’s absolutely fine with her. All she wants is a baby.’  Over the years, Jen has always dreamed of having a child, so the pregnancy is clearly everything to her.  In the past, she has lashed out at suggestions that she chose her Hollywood career over becoming a mum: ‘This continually is said about me: that I was so career-driven and focused on myself; that I don’t want to be a mother and how selfish that is,’ she told Allure.  Denying that was the case, she said: ‘No. Even saying it gets me a little tight in my throat.’  For the full story, and to see more exclusive pictures of Jen's baby bump, see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!",

        "text": "The Kardashian family isn’t pleased with Rob’s Instagram and Twitter drama-meltdown. As CI readers know, on Wednesday, Rob went on a rant attacking his ex, Blac Chyna, where he accused her of cheating on him.  The Keeping Up With The Kardashian’s star continued to release “revenge porn” type photos and videos to embarrass the woman.  If that wasn’t enough, Rob went on to accuse her of being a “crazy person,” “disrespectful,” and claimed she spent tens of thousands of dollars on cosmetic alterations.  According to the reality star, he spent over $100,000 on plastic surgery for his baby momma.  The Kardashian brother threatened Chyna, saying that she won’t be able to see their daughter ever again unless she stops drinking alcohol and consuming narcotics like “cocaine, X, and E.”  And what did Chyna have to say about all of this?  She responded with some drama of her own, alleging that Kardashian beat her.  However, she has since deleted the Snap where she made the initial accusation.  A source revealed today “the entire family was very disappointed in Rob’s actions yesterday. All of the sisters are trying not to react publicly, and are working to brush it under the rug.”  The insider added that Kris Jenner is the one who is the most upset.  “She is very distraught,” the insider revealed, and “Kourtney Kardashian is in her own little world with Younes Bendjima, and Khloe is busy with her boyfriend Tristan Thompson. They don’t have time for Rob’s drama, but they do want what is best for Rob’s child, Dream. They are afraid Rob’s outburst will affect Blac and Rob’s baby.”  The Kardashian family knows what he did was wildly inappropriate, but they still stand by him, because after all, he is family.  Things might be getting worse for Rob, considering Blac’s attorney Walter Mosley said to E! News that they might take legal action against the reality star for releasing “revenge porn.”  Advertisement  As CI readers know, Mischa Barton is currently battling her own case regarding the leaking of inappropriate “private” footage of her in the bedroom. Times are changing, and a person can’t release private images to harass another individual anymore without legal repercussions. What do our readers think of this fiasco? Is Rob out of line or does Chyna deserve it? Perhaps, it’s both?",

        "text": "The tragic, unexpected death of Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington was ruled a suicide by hanging on July 20, when his body was discovered in his Los Angeles home. On Tuesday (Dec. 5), further details have emerged detailing the conditions of Bennington’s death, via autopsy and toxicology results.  The findings, published through TMZ, show \"a trace amount\" of alcohol in the singer's system at the time of death. An earlier version of this story reported MDMA (ecstasy) was also detected, though TMZ now asserts that after Bennington's blood tested \"presumptive positive\" for the drug, two subsequent tests disproved this. A prescription bottle of Zolpidem (the generic version of the sleep aid Ambien) and a small amount of beer was also found in Bennington’s bedroom.  The report coincides with June’s suicide report. “Autopsy findings are characteristic of suicidal hanging,” deputy medical examiner Dr. Christopher Rogers’ report reads. “There was a history of suicidal ideation [in Bennington].“  The Linkin Park frontman had battled depression and alcoholism throughout his life and attended rehab in 2006. According to his longtime friend Ryan Shuck (who played guitar in Bennington’s side project Dead by Sunrise) he had been six months sober at one point in 2017. While his friends said he was in good spirits and planning for the future through much of this year and last, he had also suffered alcoholic relapses over that time.  On Oct. 27, members of Linkin Park, Blink-182, No Doubt and numerous other stars held a tribute concert in Bennington’s honor at Los Angeles’ Hollywood Bowl. On Dec. 15, LP plans to release One More Light Live, featuring 2017 recordings from the band’s final shows with its fallen singer.",

The chorus of that song goes, per Genius, \"Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?/Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?/You gon' gain the whole world/But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?/Be careful with me/Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'.\" She followed that up with three cute photos of herself...coincidence or secret message?

        "text": "This article is about the series that aired between 2009–2012. For the 2018 series, see Jersey Shore: Family Vacation  Jersey Shore is an American reality television series that ran on MTV from December 3, 2009, to December 20, 2012, in the United States. The series follows the lives of eight housemates at a vacation home: in Seaside Heights, New Jersey in seasons one, three, five and six, South Beach, Florida in season two and Florence, Italy in season four, respectively.  The show debuted amid controversy regarding its use of the terms \"Guido/Guidette\", its portrayal of Italian-Americans and allegations of perpetuating stereotypes, as well as criticism from locals that the cast members were not residents of the area.[1][2][3][4] (Most were from New York, and at least two of them were not Italian.)  The show became a pop culture phenomenon, with classes and conferences at universities about the show, and journalists listing it as one of the most notable shows of the time. The Shore franchise spawned several international adaptations in other countries. Four of the Jersey Shore cast members received spin-off shows on MTV, with the most successful being Snooki & JWOWW . Most of the cast would go on to appear in other reality programs or receive their own shows on various networks.  On August 20, 2017, a one-off television special called Reunion Road Trip: Return to the Jersey Shore aired on the E! network.[5][6] On November 27, 2017, MTV announced that the cast (with the exception of Giancola) would be reuniting in Miami, Florida, for a new reunion series titled Jersey Shore: Family Vacation.[7] The series premiered globally on April 5, 2018. According to MTV, it is considered a new series and not the seventh season of the original show.[7][8]  Overview  Season Episodes Originally aired First aired Last aired 1 9 December 3, 2009 ( ) January 21, 2010 ( ) 2 13 July 29, 2010 ( ) October 21, 2010 ( ) 3 13 January 6, 2011 ( ) March 24, 2011 ( ) 4 12 August 4, 2011 ( ) October 20, 2011 ( ) 5 11 January 5, 2012 ( ) March 15, 2012 ( ) 6 13 October 4, 2012 ( ) December 20, 2012 ( )  Cast  Production history  VH1 producer Anthony Beltempo proposed the idea of a show focusing on the \"guido\" lifestyle for TV, in the form of a competition series. Executive producer SallyAnn Salsano, who previously worked on A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila, devised a new concept, inspired by her own summers in a Jersey summer shore house, and retained casting director Doron Ofir to find the cast. MTV Networks President Van Toffler felt that the series \"loud, young, bold\" style was better suited to MTV's sensibilities than VH1, and MTV programming executive Tony DiSanto felt that \"[After The Hills], it was time to go for a more authentic approach, like a documentary.\" Van Toffler described the casting process by saying they looked for \"candor, honesty, boldness and a very combustible, chaotic mess. You could honestly say none of these people were traditionally beautiful.\"[17]  Paul \"DJ Pauly D\" DelVecchio and Mike \"The Situation\" Sorrentino during shooting in Florence, Italy in May 2011.  The series follows the lives of eight housemates spending their summer in a summer share in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, known as The Jersey Shore House, as well as other locations in other seasons. Residences include a confessional room for cast members to self-record their thoughts on daily house drama. Season 1 followed cast members Angelina Pivarnick, Jennifer Farley, Michael Sorrentino, Nicole Polizzi, Paul DelVecchio, Ronald Ortiz-Magro, Samantha Giancola, and Vincenzo Guadagnino at the Jersey Shore. Jersey Shore premiered on December 3, 2009, with back-to-back episodes, averaging 1.375 million viewers.[43] Although the initial ratings were considered unimpressive to Salsano, they slowly grew in popularity, and was the subject of parody on Saturday Night Live after the third week, a turnaround that MTV executive Tony DiSanto calls \"the fastest 0 to 60 I've ever seen on a show\".[17] Season 1 posted strong growth every week and ranked #1 in its time period versus all cable competition among P12–34 (people 12 to 34 years old) during the first quarter of 2010, with a season high 2.6 rating for the finale.[44] The season 1 finale audience, 4.8 million, was more than triple that of the premiere, an increase of more than 3.4 million, and was MTV's highest rated original series telecast in almost two years.[44] Overall, the season 1 averaged 2.7 million viewers.[45]  In an article in Rolling Stone, it was mentioned that the house had 35 remote-controlled cameras in fixed locations, 12 hand-held ones, one IMX camera and six DV cameras.[46] Nicole Polizzi said that:  They have cameras everywhere, all the time ... You're always being watched. You kind of get a little paranoid, because you're like, 'Who's watching me?' ... It's trippy. it messes with your head. But that's why we go crazy. That's why we fight with each other. That's why we drink. We're living ...",
