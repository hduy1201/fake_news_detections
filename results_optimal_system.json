The truth, though, is that a good chunk of them are swiping left and right just as often as the rest of us are.  Want to know which celebrities you’re most likely to see on one of your swipe binges, or at the very least the ones you may have glossed over in the past? Read on. And as they say, where there’s smoke there’s fire — in other words, these celebrities are hardly the only ones using dating apps.  1. Amy Schumer  While she ended up marrying someone else earlier this year, actress Amy Schumer admitted to meeting her ex-boyfriend Ben Hanisch on Tinder. “In my main profile picture, I was wearing sunglasses and a baseball cap with no makeup. It was a selfie and I made a gross face, looking as though I were dying, because I was hiking, so I was,” Schumer wrote in her 2016 book of personal essays, “The Girl With The Lower Back Tattoo.” “I also put up a picture of Sophia from ‘The Golden GIrls,’ Claire Danes making her cry face on ‘Homeland,’ and one more normal more normal photo where I was smiling and wearing a sweatshirt. Vanessa [Bayer] and I posted our profiles at the same time and scream-giggled like little girls.”  2. Adam Rippon  Earlier this year, figure skater Adam Rippon revealed that he met his boyfriend, Jussi-Pekka Kajaala, on Tinder. He told People that the relationship was still “fresh” — but that he’s “fresh,” too. “[We’ve] been talking for the past seven months” and then “started to hang out a little bit more, because we were both really busy,” Rippon said in April.  3. Demi Lovato  In her 2017 documentary “Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated,” Lovato opened up about using dating apps to connect with both men and women. “I am open to human connection, so whether that’s through a male or a female, it doesn’t matter to me.”  4. Katy Perry  In between her concerts and epic shoe collection, it appears that pop star Katy Perry also finds time to swipe. After Perry called it quits with fellow musician John Mayer back in 2014, Perry had the perfect response when asked if she was single by Power 105.1’s The Breakfast Club. “I’m really deep on Tinder, so I don’t have a lot of time,” she said.  5. Laverne Cox  You’ve seen her on “Orange Is The New Black,” and you probably follow her on Instagram. And if you’re so inclined, you can also look for her on Tinder. “Honestly, I’m a Tinder girl. When I broke up with my ex, I went back on Tinder, because I feel like if you want to date, you have to be on the apps,” Cox told Natalie Morales and Kit Hoover while on “Access” in March. “You have to be on the apps to be in the game.” She admitted that she’s also “good at screening,” because she’s been “internet dating” for a long time now.  6. Zac Efron  Want to make your high school dreams come true? See if you can find “High School Musical” star Zac Efron on Tinder. If you swipe right, he’ll be thrilled. “Amazingly, when I signed up for Tinder, nobody swiped me!” Efron told the British Newspaper The Times in 2016. “They thought [my profile] was fake.”  Swiping left on Zac Efron sounds like a mistake we’d never get over.  7. Chelsea Handler  Ask talk show host Chelsea Handler how she feels about dating apps, and she’ll tell you she’s all about them. “Oh, I’m on all those apps,” Handler told ET’s Nischelle Turner. “I like to hook up, so when I go to London or New York or if I’m out of town and I want, I’ll do that … I’m on Tinder [and] all that stuff. I’m a regular person.”  8. Hilary Duff  With baby no. 2 on the way and a starring role on the TV show “Younger,” there’s no doubt that Hilary Duff is a busy young woman. But back in 2015, she revealed to Ryan Seacrest that she was on Tinder after speculation that her profile was fake. “It kind of started out to be a joke with my girlfriends. I was like, ‘Explain this whole thing to me because it’s kind of blowing my mind,’” she said. “In my life, I’ve always had really serious boyfriends, I’ve always met people through work, and I’ve never been on a blind date.”  9. Lindsay Lohan  Sure, it’s been a while since 2013 — but five years ago, Lindsay Lohan was so immersed in the online dating world that she actually found her brother on Tinder. “Look who I just found on @tinderapp … hey bro,” Lohan wrote in an Instagram caption.  10. Charlize Theron  While on “The Ellen Degeneres Show,” Charlize Theron opened up about the hilarious way Chelsea Handler convinced her to sign up for a dating app. “She was on her phone and she showed it to me and she was explaining it to me in that Chelsea Handler way, which is just like, ‘Yeah, everybody’s doing this. What’s wrong with you? Where have you been, under a rock?’” Theron said. “So then I took real interest, and I was like, okay, well tell me, how does it work? And she’s swiping all these faces of guys in all different sorts of — I’m going to sound like I’m 80....",

        "text": "A woman who was left with 'zombie boobs' after a failed fat transfer has to decide if she is willing to risk losing her nipples by having a second surgery to fix her deformed breasts.  In a preview clip from Thursday night's episode of the E! reality series Botched, Dr. Terry Dubrow warns his patient Shannon that it is a high-risk procedure because she doesn't have a great deal of blood supply coming into her nipples.  Although he has yet to lose a nipple over the course of his career, the surgeon admits that it's a possibility if Shannon decides to go under the knife again.  Scroll down for video  Looking for help: Shannon asks Dr. Terry Dubrow and Dr. Paul Nassif to fix her misshapen 'zombie boobs' on Thursday's episode of the E! reality series Botched  Yikes: The patient was left with deformed breasts after a failed fat transfer  'So, this is old. This is dead fat. So, all that fat transfer did was die,' Dr. Dubrow tells Shannon as he examines her breasts.  'For a fat transfer to the breast to work, the fat has to be good and the tissue you're transferring it to has to have good blood supply,' he explains during his confessional.  'In Shannon's case, that is absolutely not going to work, and, in my opinion, is a very weak solution.'  After nixing the possibility of a second fat-transfer surgery, Dr. Dubrow gives Shannon a rundown of the multi-step procedure she will have to undergo to fix her breasts.  The surgeon's complicated approach includes reconstruction and a new pair of implants.  'The breast tissue loss that you have from the original operation means the blood supply coming into the nipple is not that robust, he says. 'This is a risky procedure. I could lose your nipples with this.  No can do: Dr. Dubrow tells her that her breast is filled with 'dead fat,' explaining that a second fat transfer was out of the question  Complicated: Dr. Dubrow gives Shannon a rundown of the multi-step procedure she will have to undergo to fix her breasts, including reconstruction and new breast implants  'Have I ever lost a nipple? No. You want to be my first?' he asks Shannon, who shakes her head in response.  During her confessional, Shannon admits she is terrified because she would like to be able to breastfeed her children one day.  Dr. Dubrow also makes it clear that she won't have any control over what breast implants he decides to give her if she goes along with the surgery.  'I know what your goal is. You want to be filled out so when you're in clothes it looks like you've got breasts. You want a breast implant look, meaning you want a breast augmentation,' he says.  'But in terms of size, if you want me to do your surgery — I rarely say this to patients — it's up to me what size we use. That's my call, and if that's not acceptable, that's a deal breaker. It's up to me.'  Dr. Dubrow tells the camera that he needs Shannon to 'temper expectations' because she won't be getting her exact dream results if she has the surgery.  Complications: Dr. Dubrow explains that Shannon doesn't have a robust blood supply coming into the nipples because of the breast tissue loss she has from her original surgery  Say what? 'This is a risky procedure. I could lose your nipples with this,' he tells her  'It's scary,' says Shannon, and Dr. Dubrow agrees, telling her: 'It is scary. This is big-time, hi-risk surgery.'  However, Dr. Paul Nassif reassures her that Dr. Dubrow is a talented surgeon and the reward will most-likely outweigh the risks.  'The good news is you're now in someone's hands that is very good at this,' he says. 'There's a great chance of your breasts looking a lot better than you having a problem with your nipples.'  In another preview clip from the episode, Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif meet with Michelle, a woman who was left scarring on her chin after a botched surgery.  'I went into the doctor. He looked at my chin area and there was a double chin and some loose skin, so he said that I should put in an implant, and I should get some liposuction around my face and stuff,' she explains during her consultation.  Michelle agreed to the procedure, explaining that her original doctor was a 'board certified plastic surgeon.'  'Two days after he took the bandage off to see, and immediately there was a little lump here [on the right side of her chin]. And then there was a ball here [on the left side], and he said that was scar tissue and this [on the bottom right side of her chin], he wasn’t sure what this was,' she says.  Weighing her options: Dr. Paul Nassif reassures her that Dr. Dubrow is a talented surgeon and the reward will most-likely outweigh the risks  Struggle: Shannon has to decide if she is willing to risk losing her nipples by having a second surgery to fix her breasts  Dr. Dubrow stresses it's impossible to develop scar tissue in just a couple of days.  'Scar tissue does not form that quickly after surgery,' he tells the camera. 'If Michelle had a wound problem, it was because the surgical procedure reduc...",

        "text": "The Most Surprising Revelations From the New Dolly Parton Book — Including the Time She Contemplated Suicide  Behind the big hair, big acclaim and even bigger personality — nobody knows Dolly like Dolly.  Dolly Parton’s rags-to-riches story and complicated past are the focus of a new book, Dolly on Dolly, Interviews and Encounters with Dolly Parton. The book is not authorized or endorsed by Parton herself, but rather is a collection of interviews published over five decades of the 71-year-old country legend’s career and compiled by editor Randy L. Schmidt.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Here are some of the most surprising revelations detailed in the project:  Her dog Popeye stopped her from committing suicide  In the early 1980s, Parton contemplated suicide after having an “affair of the heart” that ended in heartbreak. As a result, she struggled with her weight, suffered from serious health issues and had to cancel a tour due to death threats — all while trying to get over the “nightmare” that was working with Burt Reynolds on the 1982 film, The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.  Parton says she was sitting in her bedroom one day when she eyed her handgun for a long time, before finally picking it up. At that moment, she says, her dog Popeye came running up the stairs.  “The tap-tap-tap of his paws jolted me back to reality [and] I suddenly froze,” Parton said in an interview. “I put the gun down. Then I prayed. I kinda believe Popeye was a spiritual messenger from God.”  She called peeing the bed a “pleasure” growing up  Parton has long been open about growing up poor in her hometown of Sevierville, Tennessee, but the book goes into further detail about how desperate the times were for her family.  In the summer, the kids would bathe in the river and then in the winter, they would bathe themselves with a pan of water. Parton was the fourth born of 12 kids, and she would have to bathe every night because three to four kids slept in a bed at a time and someone would ultimately pee the bed.  “That was the only warm thing we knew in the wintertime. That was our most pleasure to get peed on,” she described.  She has always had an open mind about sex  Though Parton won’t reveal the age when she lost her virginity, she admitted that she grew up fast and learned about sex from her older cousins and uncles.  “I always had an open mind about sex,” she said. “We all did. It was not a vulgar thing.”  She once threatened to shoot a man  At the age of 21, Parton and her friend were walking to a theater in Manhattan when men approached them thinking they were hookers.  As a man started grabbing Parton and offered her money, she pulled out a pistol and promised that if he touched her again, that she’d shoot him.  “I would have shot his feet off or shot at the ground,” she said. “That cooled the man’s jets and he took off.”  She thinks of her trademark appearance as a “gimmick”  Parton is known for her signature style, but she calls it all a “gimmick.”  ” I’ve never thought of myself as being a sex symbol and I don’t want to have to be a beautiful woman, like Raquel Welch,” she said.  As far as surgery goes, Parton said that her breasts are real although she has had them lifted. She admits, though, to nips and tucks, liposuction and collagen injections.",

        "text": "Whether she’s sailing by on a UPS truck or loudly proclaiming herself unable to come to the phone because she’s dead, Taylor Swift is increasingly inescapable. The star’s next conquest? The app store, which will see the debut of her proprietary app later this year, just in time to coincide with the publicity cycle for the artist’s new album, Reputation, slated for November.  The Swift Life comes from Glu Mobile, the same company responsible for games like Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and Nicki Minaj: The Empire. According to a first-look video the company released, Swift’s app will be less game and more access. It seems to borrow from the other Kim Kardashian app, the one that isn’t from Glu, the Kim Kardashian West Official App, which offers “premium” content to paid subscribers. “Connect with Taylor!” the video promises. “Get exclusive pics and video!” In addition to access to Taylor, the app will provide opportunities for Swift fans to connect and network with each other, building on Swift’s already-strong presence on platforms like Twitter, Tumblr, and Instagram.  The video also teases “Taymojis,” another feature strangely reminiscent of a certain reality TV star’s “Kimojis.” The two may be enemies engaged in a battle over “receipts,” but apparently that hasn’t stopped Swift from taking ample inspiration from Kardashian’s business playbook. In-app purchases weren’t mentioned in the preview but seem like a good bet, given Swift’s talent for monetizing her every move: That may be the real secret of the Swift life, which means the Swift Life will be right on brand.",

Oz has been on “The Chew” since its start in 2011, along with co-hosts Carla Hall, Mario Batali, Michael Symon and Clinton Kelly. Oz will not be replaced for the seventh season, which kicks off on Sept. 5.  “It has been so much fun having lunch with you on TV’s most delicious daytime show for the past six seasons, and I am immensely grateful to have found dear friends in my co-hosts and our team,” Oz said in a statement. “I have had the great privilege of growing up at our family table, and have shared some huge milestones along the way — including the birth of my first two children, and recent announcement of a third on the way! — and am lucky to have had ‘The Chew’ as a bright beginning to my career.”  Oz — the daughter of TV personality Dr. Oz — is a nutritional author, who first broke out on the scene with her best-selling book “The Dorm Room Diet,” which she wrote in 2006 when she was a college student. Aside from “The Chew,” she is also known for her regular appearances on various shows, including Food Network’s “Cooks vs. Cons.”  “The Chew” creator and executive producer Gordon Elliott said, “She is one of the greatest natural broadcasters I have ever worked with. The moment she sat at the table with Mario, Clinton, Michael and Carla, I knew we had a great television show. Her chemistry, honesty and intelligence are her trademarks, and they will stand with her wherever she goes.”  Rebecca Campbell, president, ABC-owned stations and daytime, added, “When Daphne started with us, she had recently graduated college, was a new bride and ready to take on the world. She is now a mother, broadcaster, writer and inspiration to millions of viewers whom she has shown how to create healthier eating options for themselves and their families. She really has created a unique brand for herself and the network.”  “The Chew” has been nominated for seven Emmy awards and has won two awards for outstanding informative talk show and outstanding informative talk show host for the group, including Oz, whose departure was first reported by TV Line.",

        "text": "A Georgia father wrote an open letter to Ariana Grande in the wake of the deadly Manchester suicide bombing that killed 22 and left dozens injured  Father Pens Moving Letter to Ariana Grande in Wake of Manchester Attack: 'Take Care of You First'  A Georgia father has penned a moving letter to Ariana Grande in the wake of the deadly suicide bombing that killed 22 people and left dozens more injured after one of the pop star’s concerts in Manchester, England.  Patrick Millsaps, a father of three teen daughters, offered some “redneck love” to the 23-year-old in his letter, declaring, “You don’t have a dadgum thing to apologize for.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “You see, you are no more responsible for the actions of an insane coward who committed an evil act in your proximity than you would be for a devastating natural disaster or acts of morons near your hotel,” he continued.  The candid address comes just days after Salman Abedi, 22, detonated an explosive at around 10:33 p.m. local time on Monday near the ticket office outside Manchester Arena, Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said.  Many remained hospitalized after the attack, as officials released the identities of those killed. Among the dead are an 8-year-old girl, Saffie Roussos, and several teenagers.  In the wake of the bombing, an insider told PEOPLE that Grande is “absolutely crushed” as a result of the incident.  “She and her loved ones have barely slept this week,” the source said.  Now, in his letter, Millsaps urged the star to take all the time to herself that she needs.  “Spend time with your God, your family and your friends who will give you space and support when you need it,” he wrote. “Hell, go lick as many freaking donuts as you want. Girl, you deserve it!”  Millsaps spoke of his own children — two 12-year-olds and a 13-year-old — in the letter, noting that they often listen to Grande’s music during the drive to school — “I will neither confirm nor deny that I have personally seen every episode of Sam & Kat.”",

The actor, who is working to stay in shape for his upcoming project, Six Billion Dollar Man, reveals on The Ellen DeGeneres Show Wednesday who would like him to put a top on.  “My daughters get very annoyed by the pictures. Very annoyed,” the 46-year-old says. “I get ‘Dad, put a shirt on’ all the time. Even when I have a shirt on! If I have one shirt, they say put another shirt on.”  Though his daughters may find their father embarrassing at times, his anti-dad bod does occasionally come in handy.  “They don’t like it when I scare the boyfriend and then all of the sudden they’re like, ‘Dad, can you come see me at school?’ because they want me to come and scare the boyfriend,” Wahlberg quips.  With four children, Wahlberg is thrilled with any affection they throw his way. He even brags about getting a recent hug from his eldest child, 14-year-old Ella.  “She was just off guard for a second,” he jokes to DeGeneres. “She slipped up for a second and didn’t realize it until we were mid-hug.”  In honor of his kids — Ella, Michael, 12, Brendan, 9, and Grace, 8 — Wahlberg wanted to come up with a way to get students excited to learn. He found that in a revival of Captain Kangaroo, the popular children’s TV show that aired from 1955-1984.  “I’m trying to find new ways to get my kids interested in science, technology, engineering, things like that. Mathematics, which is the worst,” Wahlberg shares. “So … what made me interested in school was Captain Kangaroo, which ran for, like, 30 years. They did 50 seasons. We are bringing back a cool STEM scientist as Captain Kangaroo.”  Last summer, Wahlberg exclusively told ET how he felt about a boy showing interest in Ella.  \"Nobody is a good type or sort. For me, you know, I'm super overprotective,\" he explained. \"But he's just a very nice, young, smart boy who is very polite and well prepared.\"  As for the rest of his kids, the dislike over the shirtless pics isn’t too surprising.  \"They pull no punches,\" he admitted last June. \"They're very honest.\"  Wahlberg may be in shape, but even he doesn't eat healthy all the time!

Marlene King and directed by Ron Lagomarsino.[7] King revealed the title of the premiere on Twitter on March 17, 2016.[8] On August 29, 2016, it was confirmed that this would be the final season of the series.[9]  Overview [ edit ]  A.D. gives the Liars 24 hours to find Charlotte's real killer or Hanna dies. While discussing possible suspects, the girls' suspicion fell on Alison. Aria suspects the red jacket blonde she saw entering the church was Alison. Emily finds the jacket in Alison's things and Caleb gives it to A.D. Meanwhile, Hanna manages to escape. Elliot's true motive is later revealed to Alison; she managed to use his phone to alert the girls to her location when he takes her out in his car one night. She jumps out of the car and he gives chase but Hanna accidentally runs him over and they bury him in the woods.  The Liars find out Jenna is calling Elliot as \"Archer\" on his burner phone. Mona then traces most of the sent messages from a secret apartment where they find out his real name is \"Archer Dunhill\". Toby discovers this and gets the cops to release Alison who reveals that she was the red jacket blonde but only tried to comfort Charlotte. Jenna befriends Sara and Noel begins helping them. Emily confronts Jenna and Sara. Jenna reveals that she became Charlotte's friend after feeling sympathy for her in Welby and helped Archer fake his identity to be with Charlotte. Sara reveals that they are all looking for the same thing but is killed soon after. A.D. tricks Hanna into believing Archer is alive and records her digging up his grave.  The Liars find videos in Noel's cabin of him torturing them in the dollhouse. Hanna kidnaps Noel after negotiating with him doesn't work and films an interrogation video. He manages to escape and lures the Liars to an abandoned blind school. They leave the dollhouse videos on a table and someone takes them but Noel and Jenna attempt to murder them. In the confrontation, Noel is accidentally killed, and Spencer is shot by A.D., while Jenna corners Spencer. Jenna prepares to kill Spencer, but is knocked out by Mary. She then reveals that Spencer is her second child. A.D. saves Jenna who asks if they shot Spencer.  One week later, Spencer has recovered and A.D. sends Jenna to confess to the cops that Noel wanted money Charlotte left Jenna for another eye surgery, killed Sara and tried to kill Jenna in the blind school. Peter returns and reveals that Mary is the one who killed Jessica. Hanna and Spencer follow the trail of a private investigator he hired to find Mary and bump into Ted who reveals he has been hiding her as she is his college fling with whom he conceived Charles. Mary reveals to Spencer that Peter and Jessica were planning to kill her, thus she used his pills to kill Jessica. A.D. then uses Emily's stolen eggs to impregnate Alison, as a way to further torture the liars. Meanwhile, A.D. hires Sydney Driscoll as their helper and she fakes being A.D. to recruit Aria into joining the A.D. team. Aria is forced into playing and becomes A.D.'s new helper, destroying Emison's baby nursery and leaving an \"A\" message in Spencer's house, until the Liars catch her in the act and she defects. Mona, who is becoming addicted to the A-game again, reveals that she tried to scare Charlotte into not resuming the A-game but Charlotte attacked her and she killed her in self-defense. Mary confesses to Rollins and Jessica's murder. A.D. ends the game as they have finally learned that Mona was Charlotte's killer.  One year later, Mary escapes from prison and Mona is released from Welby but rejoins the A-Team and is sent to kidnap Spencer, who comes face-to-face with A.D. – Alex Drake, her twin sister. Mary reveals she sold Alex to a London family to get out of Radley. Alex ran away and met Wren who revealed everything about Spencer to her and introduced her to Charlotte who left her everything. She became A.D. to use the Liars to find Charlotte's killer and killed Wren as he always saw her as Alex while she wanted to become Spencer to have her \"perfect life\". She explains that Sara was looking for Charlotte's false treasure in the Radley which was actually the secret file and Jenna recruited Noel to look for \"Charlotte's sister\".

        "text": "It's only been a few days since Vanderpump Rules star Lala Kent went public with her married boyfriend, and now she's offering some dating advice like some sort of relationship expert.  Now, anyone can give advice -- you don't need a degree to have common sense or to tell someone that their boyfriend crossed a line.  But in Lala Kent's case, the advice that she's dishing out is ... controversial.  So, Lala Kent doesn't limit her good deeds to stripping down to fight SeaWorld and other aquatic circuses. She also gives out relationship advice.  Taking to Instagram Live, Lala Kent revealed a \"f--king crazy\" direct message that she'd received from a fan who wanted her input.  \"This girl was talking about this guy that she's pretty into, she's been seeing him for a while.\"  And the girl has a specific reason for talking to Lala for advice.  \"There's quite an age gap, it's kind of like me and my man, she's my age, maybe a little older...he's like in his later 40s.\"  Randall Emmett is 46. Lala will turn 28 this year.  \"And they've never been official but he was like really cute at the beginning and then he falls off the earth.\"  Uh-oh. That's not a great sign.  \"He's like inconsistent, which as women I think is f--ked up, like don't be inconsistent.\"  It might mean that he's unsure about this relationship. It might mean that he's lying to this girl -- and maybe to someone else in his life.  Or he might be just using this girl to feel young, and then running off when it starts to feel too much like a relationship.  Whatever the cause, Lala doesn't like it any more than we do.  \"If you're gonna be inconsistent, women we need to give them the boot, it's not OK.\"  Lala goes on to explain that the girl went to dinner with this older man and that man's friend before the New Year.  The girl had a few drinks at the bar because she was nervous.  \"So she gets a little too drunk at the bar she says, they get into a cab and she starts to take her clothes off in the cab.\"  The girl was making certain that the driver couldn't see her as she did this.  It did not go over well.  \"She started taking her pants off and he started reprimanding her and getting upset and made her feel really stupid.\"  Our first thought is that this girl, who's clearly feeling insecure in this relationship enough that she's anxious before dinner and then wants reassurance that this older man finds her sexy, should dump his ass.  Lala Kent, we're happy to say, feels the same way.  \"I'll tell you how I would react, first of all my p--sy is no longer yours to have fun with, you're a f--king asshole.\"  That's good advice.  Here comes the controversy:  \"You make me feel dumb, I'm not about that life; you can call me a homewrecker, you can call me a bitch, you can call me whatever you want, when you make me feel dumb, I'm wiping my hands clean.\"  To be clear, if a guy's calling a girl names in a way that she's not okay with, that's not any more okay than ridiculing a girl as \"stupid.\"  What this girl was doing sounds desperate, which suggests to us that this guy is standoffish and cold -- maybe even more like this in front of his friend.  That's no good for a relationship, folks.  If a guy isn't friendly or is only friendly sometimes, that means that he has his own emotional issues, and it's not your job to crack through the ice. Move on to a guy who can show you how much he appreciates you.  And if a guy makes you feel dumb -- or calls you ugly names or otherwise demeans you outside of consensual bedroom roleplay -- dump his ass at the curb. It's 2018 and awful guys don't deserve great girlfriends.",

        "text": "Serena Williams' husband Alexis Ohanian celebrates daughter Olympia's first birthday See the sweet snap he shared for the big milestone!  Serena Williams and her husband Alexis Ohanian had a big reason to smile this weekend -- their daughter Olympia turned 1!  The Reddit co-founder took to Instagram to share an adorable snap of his little girl to commemorate the occasion.  \"1 year ago today, you changed our lives forever, @olympiaohanian my adventure princess,\" he wrote.  It's not the first time Ohanian has gushed about his sweet little daughter and sports icon wife. He's been Williams' biggest champion as she returned to tennis this year and made it all the way to the Wimbledon final earlier this summer.  He's also melted the internet with his modern take on successful women, what it means to be a supportive partner and more.  In an interview with \"GMA\" earlier this year, Ohanian said, \"There's probably a lot of guys who would feel threatened in a situation with a partner who is extremely talented and successful. It seems kind of absurd to me, though, because all of that success and all of that greatness is something that you should be championing.\"  And when it comes to the other lady in his life, his little Olympia, well he's your typical proud dad. So much so, that he and Serena have created an Insta account for her.  And though they spoil their little girl each and every day with love and support, Williams explained last week why there would be no birthday party for Olympia.  During a press conference for the U.S. Open, Williams revealed that \"Olympia doesn’t celebrate birthdays. We’re Jehovah’s Witnesses, so we don’t do that,\" according to People magazine.  Though Olympia didn't get a party, Williams has been a bastion of hope for all working and non-working mothers -- not only returning to and creating real change in tennis and the rules on how it handles motherhood -- but also posting about everyday motherhood and trying to create a supportive dialogue online.  Just last week, Williams wrote, \"Kids humble us. The other day on a flight home Olympia had so much energy and insisted on running up and down the aisle. When I finally got her to calm down and sit still, she threw up all over me and in the aisle. #ThisMama wants to remind all mothers the importance of supporting one another through the highs, lows, laughs and tears. Share your own stories of motherhood with hashtag #ThisMama. I’d love to hear them!\"  That post garnered half a million likes and thousands of comments from other moms dealing relating to her story.  Once again, Williams proves she's a champion on and off the court!",

Take away all the moral and ethical considerations you've had drummed into you since childhood, and what are you left with? A 105 lb. problem.\"  Advertisement:  Following a death, either accidental or deliberate, no matter how skilfully the responsible party covers it up, there remains the problem of disposing of the most obvious and most damning piece of evidence for the crime: the body itself. (There have been jurisdictions where no corpse means no murder.)  A well-designed Death Trap may include its own way to eliminate the victim's corpse, thus combining the two tropes.  There are numerous popular methods for doing this:  A common way to indicate that a bad guy is not to be messed with is if they have an original and well-thought-through method in place to entirely obliterate a human body if needed. This indicates either that they're Crazy-Prepared, or that it's something they frequently find themselves having to do.  Advertisement:  Pretty much any action movie with a significant body count won't even bother with this trope; the exception is if it's supposed to be taking place under The Masquerade, in which case The Men in Black may send in a Cleanup Crew to do the job.  See Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie, in which any post-mortem hijinks are the direct request of the deceased, and Of Corpse He's Alive, when someone tries to pretend a dead body... isn't.  Contrast Dead Guy on Display, when the body is deliberately put somewhere it will be seen, often to send a message to the person who finds it.  This is a Death Trope; spoilers ahoy.  Examples:  open/close all folders  Advertising  A Doritos ad has a man see his dog burying something, which he quickly recognizes as the family cat's collar. Then the dog is up in his face, growling, and pushes a bag of Doritos with a note reading \"You didn't see nuthin\" towards him. At the end of the ad, we hear the man's wife asking \"Have you seen the cat?\"; the man looks up and sees the dog, outside the door, another bag of Doritos in his mouth.  Anime and Manga  Comic Books  The EC Comics story \"Cold Cuts.\" Likewise in \"...And All Through the House\" wherein the matter is somewhat more pressing, due to the presence of a Serial Killer outside the house who our matricidal \"heroine\" can't simply call the police about.  The \"Kitchen Irish\" arc in Garth Ennis' The Punisher MAX has an old guy who used to do this for the old Irish mob - his method being cutting the body into lots and lots of little pieces. For example, he points out the importance of covering the entire work area with trash bags prior to cutting - as well as doing it naked so as not to catch evidence in one's clothing.  In both the comic and the film version of the Sin City story \"The Big Fat Kill,\" after Dwight and the girls of Old Town learn that the abusive scumbag that they just killed was a hero cop , they set about disposing of him and his buddies by having Dwight dump them into the Santa Yolanda Tar Pits. Things... don't go to plan.  , they set about disposing of him and his buddies by having Dwight dump them into the Santa Yolanda Tar Pits. Things... don't go to plan.

        "text": "Many people can only dream of the chance to sing their favorite artist's song right in their presence. For 12-year-old Victoria Anthony, that dream came true at Pink's concert in Vancouver on Saturday (May 12).  Back on May 1, Anthony shared a video of herself on Twitter directed to the \"Beautiful Trauma\" singer: \"when you come here, I really want to sing at your concert,\" she wrote. Anthony then gave a few examples of her incredible singing voice, including the hashtag #vicandpink in the caption to help gain traction and -- hopefully -- the attention of her idol.  After being picked up by Canadian news outlets, Pink recognized the young pop star in the making in the crowd at the show. While Anthony didn't get to go on stage, Pink did hand her the mic -- and was instantly floored.  Anthony belted out a flawless solo version of Pink's hit \"Perfect,\" drawing a roaring applause from the crowd and a stunned response from the singer. Judging by her reaction, it's safe to assume Pink thought Anthony was pretty \"perfect\" herself.  \"Thank you for that,\" the still-amazed Pink said after returning onstage. \"How do you follow that?\"  Watch Anthony give Pink a run for her money below, and see the video she tweeted that made it all happen.",

While she will be accompanied by close friends, it seems there is room for Brad.  ‘When Jen mentioned that she was planning to go skiing with friends in Aspen after New Year’s, a light bulb went off in Brad’s head,’ claims Star’s source. ‘He said he could fly over in his private jet and meet up with her there.  ‘He pointed out that they could even hit the slopes together, since no one would recognise them in their ski masks, goggles and helmets. Jen thought it was genius.  The magazine claims that Jen has booked a $10,000 a night chalet featuring multiple fireplaces and hot tubs.  ‘The trip is going to be a blast,’ claims the source, who adds, ‘I imagine Brad and Jen will steal private moments to they can have some emotional heart-to-hearts.’  Reps for both Brad and Jen have denied Star’s story, and Jen has long said how happy she is with husband Justin.",

ET spoke with the country superstars backstage at Rabobank Arena in Bakersfield, California, during their Soul2Soul World Tour on Saturday, just days ahead of their 21st wedding anniversary. The two tied the knot on Oct. 6, 1996, after meeting earlier that year when Hill opened up for McGraw during his Spontaneous Combustion Tour.  According to Hill, no anniversary gift is needed from her handsome husband.  \"He's good. He doesn't need to get me anything,\" Hill told ET's Keltie Knight. \"Honestly, do you, baby? He's good at giving gifts and making surprises.\"  Faith Hill Slays National Anthem at Stanley Cup Final, Tim McGraw Cheers Her On  Hill joked that as long as she doesn't have to exercise with her famously fit husband, it's all good.  \"That's the best gift ever,\" Hill cracked. \"That's amazing. I get to do that four-hour workout with you? No, thank you. That's my gift -- I don't have to do that workout with you.\"  On a more serious note, McGraw gushed about getting to see his wife perform every night, admitting he's still in awe of her.  \"For me, it's hearing her sing every night -- that's the best part about [the tour],\" McGraw said. \"Because she's not out there singing much... To see her up on stage, having a great time and just belting it out? I mean, I always say it: when I'm on stage with her, it's like NASCAR trying to keep up with an Indy car. She's just that good. So, to watch her sing and see what she does is pretty inspiring.\"  \"My hot wife, man,\" he sweetly added.  Even so, the two also have a sense of humor about enjoying their private time.  \"I'm going to go on a man vacation after this is over,\" McGraw said, responding to Dolly Parton's advice that the secret to her long marriage is not spending too much time together.  \"I need a girl vacation, actually,\" Hill added. \"I am surrounded by girls, but I love that. We have a great time in my dressing room.\"  Of course, McGraw said he stays clear of that area of the tour!  \"Yeah, I try to stay out of that dressing room,\" he noted. \"It's all girls in that dressing room.\"  Hill and McGraw are releasing their highly anticipated first joint album in November. For fans who can't get enough of the couple's tour, Showtime is airing behind-the-scenes footage of their tour as well as concert performances, premiering Nov. 17.  Faith Hill and Tim McGraw Release Steamy Music Video for 'Speak to a Girl' -- Watch!  Clearly, the couple is more in love than ever after more than two decades of marriage and raising three daughters together -- 20-year-old Gracie, 19-year-old Maggie and 15-year-old Audrey. Earlier this month, McGraw wished his wife a happy fiftieth birthday with a romantic Instagram message.  \"Happy birthday to the most beautiful girl in the world,\" McGraw wrote. \"You are the most remarkable person that has ever been in my life.... Our daughters could not have a better role model. I am truly in love with you more everyday. Can't wait to see what 'the rest of our life' has in store for us.\"  Watch the video below to see their cutest moments throughout the years.

The model took to Instagram early Monday morning to share a candid, emotional note about rapper 21 Savage, whom she’s been spotted spending time with in recent weeks.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “It’s pretty amazing waking up every morning feeling love like this,” she captioned a photo of the two in bed. “I’ve cried endlessly and been hurt a lot in my life, I’ve been abused, talked to like I wasn’t s—, been gaslighted and Slut shamed by men that I once loved and cared about. So I’m so thankful that God brought this amazing person in my life who genuinely has my back and is ready to ‘pull up’ to defend my honor by any means.”  “Maybe he’s just as broken as me and that’s why we’re perfect for each other,” she added. “But either way he’s not going anywhere and neither am I.”  Rose also shared a video of the two kissing and cuddling in the mirror.  “When he loves spoiling you but you got ur own money so you spoil him instead,” she wrote. “Ain’t nothin like that #thuglove.”  RELATED VIDEO: Does Amber Rose Want to Have More Kids With Ex-Husband Wiz Khalifa?  Over the weekend, Rose took to Instagram to share a clip from 21 Savage’s recent radio interview with The Real After Party on Real 92.3.  “She’s beautiful, right?” he said. “We’ve just been kicking it, man. She’s a real cool woman. She treats me like a king, so it is what it is. And no disrespect will be tolerated, at all. Keep your mouth closed, no hoes, no bitches, no nothing, ’cause I’m pulling up.”  When asked about the age difference between the two — Rose is 33 and Savage is 24 — the rapper said he was only younger “in age, not mentally.”  But that being said, he’s still learning a few things from her.  “She makes me do s— that I don’t normally do,” he explained. “Like take vitamins and drink water.”  FROM PEN: Wendy Williams’ Perfect Date Night Might Not Be What You Expect  Most recently, Rose was linked to Dancing with the Stars pro Val Chmerkovskiy. The two split in February after about five months of dating.",

        "text": "When Bella Hadid and The Weeknd broke up, you maybe sorta probs shed a tear. I mean, they were pretty damn cute. And when Abel seemingly moved on with Selena Gomez, people were still rooting for a Bella-and-The-Weeknd reunion.  This content is imported from {embed-name}. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  Anyway, it seems your inkling at a destined make-up has finally become a reality. Here are all of the biggest signs that Bella and The Weeknd are going to be a couple again...  1. They Took the Cutest Selfie While in NYC Together  The Weeknd and Bella Hadid were having a great time with one another as they hit the Big Apple. The Weeknd was playing at the Global Citizen Festival in Central Park and Bella was right there with him. He posted several pictures from a dinner they were both at together and even sneaked a selfie of the two of them at the end.  2. They Hit Up Kylie's 21st Birthday Together  Ain't no party like a Kardashian party and Bella took the perfect date for Kylie's big bash. Bella and The Weeknd were spotted together at the party and there are plenty of cute pics of the two of them together to prove it.  This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  Bella and The Weeknd were also spotted together in Chicago for Lollapalooza, where The Weeknd was headlining. Bella was in the crowd supporting her beau and even sang along to some of his biggest hits.  This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  3. Sources Say They're Back Together  According to a source from E!, the couple is \"exclusively dating and are in a great place.\" The source went on to say, \"Abel realized once he started dating around, that he actually is still in love with Bella, and they reconnected.\" Aw!  Apparently, no one close to the couple is surprised they reunited. \"Everyone around them always knew it was a matter of time, and knew the undeniable bond that they had when they were together,\" said the source. In light of this summer's crazy engagement circus...let the proposal countdown begin!  4. Bella Called The Weeknd Her Muse  The two are certainly getting very cozy together lately and while they haven't officially confirmed their relationship, Bella is not shying away from rumors. She posted videos of her and The Weeknd as they walked past an art installation.  The Weeknd was featured in the last one on her Instagram story and she captioned it, \"muse forever.\" If that doesn't mean their back together, then we don't know what does.  Instagram  5. They were spotted together in Tokyo.  It looks like it's finally happening as the couple were spotted taking in the sights in Tokyo, Japan together. Fans took videos of Bella and The Weeknd as they walked out of a store and checked out arcades throughout Tokyo.  They don't seem to be hiding their rekindled relationship after The Weeknd posted a video featuring Bella on his Instagram story.  Bella still hasn't featured The Weeknd on her page, but it's only a matter of time before she confirms they're back together again.  6. Bella Posted The Weeknd's Lyrics on Instagram  It looks like Bella just can't get The Weekend out of her mind and it's even more obvious after she posted a new photo of herself from her trip to Italy with some of his lyrics.  This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  The lyrics \"as long as u know that when I land ur mine\" are from his song \"Pretty\" from his first album, Kiss Land.  It looks like The Weekend enjoyed the throwback lyrics from his ex as he liked the photo, even though he doesn't currently follow her on Instagram.  Instagram  It looks like The Weeknd took back the like as it seems like his like doesn't appear anymore, even after searching through the photos likes. What's more interesting though is how he found the photo in the first place. Looks like The Weeknd might be looking at Bella's page more than he would like us to think.  7. Bella and The Weeknd spend a few days cuddled up inside his mansion.  You don't need to be in the CIA to solve this mystery: Where did Bella Hadid and Abel spend a recent weekend? Well, they spent it together at his mansion, of course! How do we know? Instagram tells no lies.  Abel posted a pic of him standing on the balcony of his stunning mansion with his two dogs looking up lovingly at him. Obvi, this pic is too far away to be taken from a selfie stick.

So who was behind the camera for this shot?  Well, that...",

        "text": "For most actresses on red carpets, what you’re wearing is less an expression of who you are and more an expression of what you’re worth. The very act of getting ready for an award show can be a masochist’s checklist of one’s value: Airbrush your arms so that they look more toned. Check. Get a peel or injection to make sure your face looks flawless. Check. Lose bloat by eating only before 6 p.m. and stop drinking all liquid 24 hours before the big day to send your metabolism into shock. Check. Prepping for award shows can be a weeklong marathon in dread, resulting in a one-time portrayal of improbable beauty.  You’re also often assigned a look that doesn’t reflect who you truly are but reflects what a runway wants you to be. Platform high heels and frilly dresses and a clutch purse made from the skin of dead baby lizards. I’ve spent the better part of my two decades as an actress accumulating more designer high heels than most could ever dream of, only to hit my 30s and realize I hated wearing most of them and always had. Years ago when I was nominated for a Golden Globe for best actress in a television drama, I had a full anxiety attack after the dress fitting, even though I had found a beautiful dress that fit me nicely. I found myself in my car, the air-conditioning on full blast, sobbing into my steering wheel. The anxiety I was feeling wasn’t about the dress itself. It was about the fulfillment of the obligations of the dress.  Not all actresses loathe getting ready for award shows, though. For some, the act of dressing up is a joy that comes quite naturally. For example, one of my best friends is the actress Blake Lively, who has such extraordinary taste in fashion and clothing. I often find myself texting her to get advice on what to wear to an event where I know there will be cameras present. She is always helpful and thoughtful about what will look best on me, a favor I can’t ever seem to do for myself no matter how hard I try. In recent years, I’ve become far more comfortable in my skin and on red carpets, and I’ve had the good fortune of working with stylists such as Karla Welch and Sarah Slutsky who don’t dress a woman’s body as if it’s a tree hungry for ornaments, but rather an individual, unique body with its own sweet purpose and design.  But getting dressed does still involve obligations. We actresses are not just modeling clothing when we walk a red carpet on award show night. We are modeling a kind of behavior. We are speaking in a coded language to other women — even young girls — that says: The way I look and what I wear and how I wear it is the standard for women. What is being worn is not an exception. It is the rule. You must dress a certain way and look a certain way if you want to be valued as a woman, no matter what you do for a living or who you are. We never intend for this to be the message we are sending with what we wear, but often it is the perceived one, whether we like it or not.  I have often wondered what would happen if actresses stood in solidarity with a singular, powerful choice for just one night. What would that even look like? To uniformly reject our lifelong objectification and say: Enough. We belong to no one. We are a canvas for no expression other than the words our voices have chosen to speak.",

        "text": "Khloe sets up both Will and Stephanie with personal trainers. That’s great! Working with a trainer can actually be a life-changing experience, especially if you’re someone for whom working out is scary or unpleasant. A good trainer can teach you how to actually enjoy exercise and do it in a sustainable way. And rational exercise can certainly have a positive impact on your life. But, just to be clear, physical fitness is not happiness and personal trainers are not therapists.I know it may be confusing given that every weight-loss reality show casts the trainers as demigods or father figures, capable of healing all your psychic wounds by shouting, “GIVE ME TEN MORE!” But yeah, your trainer is not your social worker.Will gets paired with celebrity trainer Gunnar Peterson. Will wanders into his first workout session moaning about Kyle and how he drove him away with his heinous chub. (His goal, by the way, is to go from being a “bear” to a “muscle cub,” both of which are terms used to describe body types in the gay male community. As a not-male, not-gay person, I’m not going to get preachy over these terms and their use within the context of this show — but I sure hope someone does.) Losing weight, he is sure, will help get Kyle back — or else get revenge on him for leaving? It’s unclear. Will lays his sob story at Peterson’s feet, and Peterson at least has the gumption to say, “I don’t care.” But that doesn’t stop Will from continuing to overshare about his breakup and all his totally valid hurt feelings. Core strength is rad, but Will clearly needs someone to talk this out with, and — say it with me — your trainer is not your therapist.Nor are they your dietitian, by the way (unless they are an actual registered dietitian, of course, or a PhD in nutrition science — which most trainers aren’t). Stephanie gets paired with Luke Milton, who seems like a super friendly guy and may even be a good trainer. Sure, I couldn’t find his credentials anywhere, but he is quite ripped, not to mention Australian. So. That’s something. I really wanted to like him because he is literally the only person on this show — slash, in Stephanie’s life — who’s being nice to her. But then he prescribes the following nutrition program to her: “If it’s had a life, it’s good for ya.” By this, he means plants, meat, and fish, which is fine. Really, I wish he’d just left food out of it because he’s not a nutrition professional. But, at the very least, I wish he’d been a little more clear on this point rather than relying on his very poetic generalization. It sort of sounds like a cannibal diet.",

The sisters have seemingly been left unimpressed by the rapper's continual stream of tweets over the last two days, following a year-long absence from the platform.  6 Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian have cut ties with Kanye West on Twitter after pro-Trump tweets Credit: Rex Features  6 Kanye, mocked up as Trump, has been criticised for his bromance with the US President  They're not the only high profile names to boycott Kanye online, with Kanye's former collaborators Drake, Nicki Minaj, and Rihanna joining Justin Bieber, Harry Styles and Kendrick Lamar all unfollowing the controversial star.  The online exodus hasn't been missed by eagle-eyed social media users, with one writing on Twitter: \"Zayn & Harry both unfollowed Kanye on Twitter. Kings.  Another said :\"Rihanna, Drake, Katy, Ariana, Kendrick, Zayn, Nicki etc. all unfollowed Kanye 💀 he really ended himself :(.\"  While a third added: \"Khloe, Kylie and Kourtney all unfollowed Kanye.

Calling Trump \"my brother,\" he claimed they both have \"dragon energy\". The President replied saying the rapper was \"very cool\".  6 Kanye and Trump pose together at Trump Tower the day after the 2016 US election Credit: AP:Associated Press  6 Kanye has never hidden his love for the US President and even embraced him at Trump Tower Credit: AFP or licensors  Their most recent display of affection follows years of social media appreciation between Trump and the President.  The loved-up posts were rumoured to have cost the rapper nine million Twitter follows, but the claims have been proved false after Twitter confirmed Kanye still boasts around 27million followers.  Kanye, 40, tweeted: \"You don’t have to agree with Trump but the mob can’t make me not love him.\"  He also shared a picture of a Make America Great Again cap and wrote: \"My MAGA hat is signed\", followed by a string of fire emojis.  You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought. — ye (@kanyewest) April 25, 2018  Thank you Kanye, very cool! https://t.co/vRIC87M21X — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 25, 2018  Kanye's wife Kim Kardashian defended her husband by tweeting: \"To the media trying to demonise my husband let me just say this... your commentary on Kanye being erratic & his tweets being disturbing is actually scary.  \"So quick to label him as having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive is not fair.\"  I love when people have their own ideas. You don't have to be allowed anymore. Just be.    Love who you want to love. That's free thought. I'm not even political. I'm not a democrat or a republican — ye (@kanyewest) April 25, 2018  my wife just called me and she wanted me to make this clear to everyone. I don't agree with everything Trump does. I don't agree 100% with anyone but myself. — ye (@kanyewest) April 25, 2018  The rapper also took potshots at Obama during the tweeting flurry, stating that nothing changed in Chicago during his presidency.  Combating backlash from anti-Trump protesters he also shared a picture of a post by Chance The Rapper which read: \"Black people don't have to be Democrats.\"  Obama was in office for eight years and nothing in Chicago changed. — ye (@kanyewest) April 25, 2018  Kanye continued that he loved free thinkers and showed alt-right supporter Peter Thiel.  The dad-of-three tweeted: \"I'm so happy to hear that Peter Thiel would like to take a meeting. I feel very optimistic about the future.\"  Thiel is a controversial figure in American politics as he backs the alt-right and funded the Hulk Hogan case against Gawker Media for publishing a video of Hogan having sex.

        "text": "In 2007, an L.A. family's unvarnished docuseries launched on E!, and reality television, female body image, social media and, above all, the economy of celebrity were forever changed. Now the stars and producers of the megafranchise (nine TV spinoffs, hundreds of millions of dollars earned) reveal the secrets of its improbable explosion into the zeitgeist.  Wearing curve-hugging black workout pants and a white tank top, Kim Kardashian perches on a couch in the media room of her newly renovated Bel Air estate and sips Pedialyte through a straw. The makeup-free 36-year-old appears almost normal — certainly not like a mogul who, according to Forbes, banked $45.5 million the past year from a brand she built on self-­aggrandizement, shameless product peddling and nude selfies. At the epicenter of this unprecedented trajectory remains E!'s Keeping Up With the Kardashians, a living record of her happily debauched family — Kourtney, 38; Khloe, 33; Rob, 30; Kendall, 21; and Kylie, 20; as well as matriarch Kris, 61, and her ex Caitlyn Jenner, 67 (who in 2015 transitioned from Bruce). On Sept. 24, a 90-minute special will celebrate the series' 10th unapologetic year. It's a head-scratching milestone for a show that, at its conception, offered viewers little more than a voyeuristic lens into the lives of a celebrity-adjacent family — but quickly became the mother ship for all their product extensions and the platform through which Kris and her five daughters ushered in the era of the reality celebrity as a brand.  Keeping Up With the Kardashians now airs in 167 countries, boasts nine spinoffs to date and has ranked as E! Entertainment's top-rated series since 2010. And while it peaked in 2011 with 10.5 million viewers over two nights for Kim's fairy-tale wedding to Kris Humphries (they divorced after 72 days), it still averages north of 2.1 million every Sunday in its 13th season. In 2015, E! agreed to a reported $80 million deal to keep the family through season 14. But that's a pittance compared to the fashion and lifestyle empire they've built from one boutique in the Valley. With a combined social media reach of 700 million-plus followers and five insanely profitable apps, the family mints millions from a hodgepodge of endorsement deals, paid appearances and can't-stay-in-stock products. And it all grew from a show that opened its pilot with these prophetic words from Kim (already notorious for the sex tape she made with her ex, Ray J, that was made public in 2007): \"I hate you all.\"  As much as the family reveals on the show, on red carpets and on Instagram, one mystery remains. How the hell did this happen?  Kris Jenner (star, executive producer) Before the show, I was managing Bruce's speaking career and personal appearances.  Kim Kardashian (star, executive producer) I was going to [Pierce College], and after school I would go work the cash register at our store, Dash. This all happened when I was 27 …  Kendall Jenner (star) That's so crazy because I'm not even 27. We've lived the same amount of time of the same thing, but I'm not even the age you were when you started.  Ryan Seacrest (executive producer) Everyone was talking about The Osbournes, and I said to my development executive Eliot [Goldberg], \"Let's try to find something in this world and take it to E!\"  Kris One night, Deena Katz [casting director for Dancing With the Stars] came over for dinner and life was swirling around, and she said, \"This is a reality show — I think you should really talk to Ryan Seacrest.\" So I did.  Seacrest Kris told me what she envisioned, and I said, \"Let's send a crew to your house and tape some stuff and then we'll take a look at it.\" Then I realized I didn't have a crew; I didn't even have a camera. I had Eliot buy a camera, and he went and shot them. He called me after and said, \"I think we have something special.\"  Kourtney Kardashian (star, executive producer) We had talked to producers about doing a show about the three of us running the store, Dash, where Khloe and I would do the day-to-day, and Kim would come in as a stylist. It didn't go anywhere.  •••  In Caitlyn Jenner's memoir, The Secrets of My Life, released earlier this year, she implies that the series may actually have been her brainchild. She writes, \"The house is awash in puberty and adolescence and young adulthood and two parents with very different styles. It seems to me something is there for television. … Kris says she is the one who came up with the idea …\" Jenner declined to participate in this story.  Kris It's so absurd. I'm not sure what the motivation was for her to say something like that. Maybe somebody should remind her that it's called Keeping Up With the Kardashians.  Ted Harbert (then-CEO of E! Networks) Just like anybody else, I knew of the family through [O.J. Simpson attorney] Robert Kardashian. There was a bit of the stuff with Kim hanging around Paris Hilton and, of course, the fun with Ray J [who made a sex tape with Kim]. That was...",

        "text": "Judd Apatow has his daughter Maude’s back following her directorial debut during the Santa Barbara International Film Festival tonight. The 20-year-old took to Instagram to announce that her short film had been screened at the SBFF.  Judd took to Instagram to congratulate his daughter as well as the co-director, Olivia Rosen Bloom, whom he also linked on the social media platform.  Apatow – who is known for hits such as Knocked Up and Funny People – wrote alongside a picture of him and his daughter standing together.  As you may know, Maude comes from a line of entertainment juggernauts including her father, Judd, as well as her mother, Leslie Mann, who is most known for playing in Judd’s movies.  She made an appearance in the 40-Year-Old Virgin. During his 2007 film, Knocked Up, his youngest daughter, Iris, made a short cameo and even portrayed Leslie’s daughter in Funny People and This Is 40.  Maude has big shoes to fill. In fact, during an interview with Nylon in 2016, she thanked her father for his advice and took the wisdom from women such as Lena Dunham and Amy Schumer.  Maude said her father always told her to “write for yourself,” because when a person is an actor, they rarely have much control over what happens in a film.  Maude said Lena and Amy are both involved in writing, acting, directing, and editing, so it inspired her to become an all-star producer in the Hollywood’s sphere.  Advertisement  It appears as though the daughter of Apatow is just getting started, and we can’t wait to see what she has in store. Her introduction into film-making comes at a turbulent time in the entertainment capital of America, considering the wave of sexual assault allegations to flourish in recent months.",

Few celebs are as private as George, 56, and Amal Clooney, 39. So when a photographer recently got onto their property in Lake Como, Italy to snap photos of their twin babies, Ella and Alexander, it drove the movie star right up the wall! Not only is George considering pressing charges against Voici, the French magazine that acquired the images, our insider says the incident has him terrified and considering scaling up security for his family! Does this mean the world-famous couple are about to turn their home into Fort Knox? Head here for images of this picture-perfect couple!  “This invasion of privacy has set off a huge chain reaction for George,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “He’s now planning to overhaul his security, and not just at his Lake Como home. He’s got five properties and he’s looking to beef up security on all of them. He’s always been fairly blasé about security, even when he had a full-on stalker, he was never actually afraid. But now that he’s a father everything has changed.” Parenthood has certainly brought about another side of the Suburbicon director!  Our insider went on to explain that the photographer’s trespassing has George fearing for his one-and-a-half-month-old children and anxious over what could happen to them. “He’s thinking in worst case scenarios, he just can’t help himself. He’s horrified that someone was able to get on his property and get that close to his babies without him knowing. He’s planning to spend whatever it takes to make sure it never happens again.” Hopefully George and his gorgeous better half will be able to move past this troubling incident without living in fear!

        "text": "Pamela Anderson has spoken of her 'romantic' connection with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.  The Canadian-American actress, 51, said Assange is one of her favorite people in an interview with Harvey Levin that aired on Fox News on Sunday night.  Describing him as 'imperfect', the former Baywatch star said: 'He's definitely an interesting person and there's definitely a romantic kind of connection 'cause it's a romantic struggle.  'We have this closeness… he's not close to people like he is to me.'  Scroll down for video  Pamela Anderson spoke of her 'romantic' connection with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in an interview that aired on Sunday night  Anderson, who is in a relationship with French footballer Adil Rami, said she had first met Assange to figure out how to be a 'more effective' activist – and brought him vegan food.  Since then, she says she has visited Assange a number of times at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.  'Now it's a tradition that I bring him vegan food every time I see him, and I see him a lot,' she added.  They have deep conversations about everything from the Bible to animal rights and jealousy, she said.  Now, the pair are planning to work together to create 'career activists' by choosing 10 activists from across the globe and pay their salaries for 10 years, she said.  Anderson says she has visited Assange a number of times at the Ecuadorian embassy in London (above)  She previously spoke about her concerns for Assange's health and well-being after Ecuador announced it had taken away Assange's Internet access and visitor privileges.  The Australian was undergoing 'a slow, painful death' at the hands of the US and UK, Anderson told the New York Post in March.  Last month, Ecuador's president said it was in talks with Britain over Assange's fate.  Assange has been holed up at Ecuador's embassy in London since 2012 when he was granted political asylum.  'The issue of Mr. Assange is being treated with the British government and I understand that we have already established contact with Mr. Assange's lawyers so we can find a way out,' Ecuador President Lenin Moreno told Spanish daily newspaper El Pais.  Anderson, who is in a relationship with French footballer Adil Rami, said she had first met Assange to figure out how to be a 'more effective' activist  'Mr. Assange has been in this situation for over five years and we have to find a way out for him.  'A way out that defends his rights, mainly his right to life, and which at the same time can give Ecuador the possibility to not have what, without a doubt, represents a problem for our country.'  Assange, 47, sought refuge in Ecuador's London embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden to face sexual assault allegations, which he denies.  The Australian computer programmer claims the accusations were politically motivated and could lead to his extradition to the United States to face imprisonment over WikiLeaks's publication of secret US military documents and diplomatic cables in 2010.  Assange has been holed up at Ecuador's embassy in London since 2012 when he was granted political asylum  Swedish authorities dropped their investigations last year, but British authorities still want to arrest him for breaching bail conditions.  US intelligence agencies have also concluded that WikiLeaks co-ordinated with Russian intelligence to release hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election campaign.  Last year, Attorney General Jeff said arresting Assange was a 'priority.'  In March, Ecuador cut off Assange's ability to communicate with the outside world after he broke a 2017 promise to not interfere in other countries' affairs while in the mission.  Assange particularly drew the ire of Ecuador by angering the Spanish government with his support for separatist leaders in Spain's Catalonia region who sought to secede last year.  Moreno said the 'ideal' solution would involve Assange accepting a 'penalty' for having breached British bail conditions and then be 'extradited to a country where he does not face any danger.'",

        "text": "Melania Trump. Is she trapped? A reluctant first lady? Or is she poised, polished and a quiet, but supportive, first lady? Who is the real Melania? Very few, at least among those who are speaking publicly, will say. “I’m very strong. People, they don’t really know me. People think and talk about me like, ‘Oh, Melania. Oh, poor Melania.’ Don’t feel sorry for me. Don’t feel sorry for me. I can handle everything.” But as Donald Trump’s presidency has progressed, the first lady has become a versatile avatar, her image split sharply down political lines. In one version of the public imagination, Melania is unhappy. She dislikes her husband and disagrees with his policies. She may even be mulling a divorce. This Melania has shown up on late-night TV and in tabloids. “You’re beautiful, dutiful Melania. I can’t take it anymore.” Then there’s the other version of Melania, painted by conservative media as confident, fashion forward, graceful and adored. “I have been so impressed with, not just her quiet dignity, as you brought up, but also just this diplomatic use of fashion.” This version is closer to the official portrayal of Melania. Through her spokespeople, the first lady says she is supportive of her husband and focused on raising their son, Barron. “I support my husband 100 percent. But we have a 9-year-old son together, Barron. And I’m raising him.” She says she prefers to take a back seat to her husband, to keep his place in the limelight. It’s not the first time Melania’s been in the public eye. “You spin, baby, you spin.” She’s a former model and jewelry designer. “I love when idea comes to life. And I study architecture and design and it’s something very creative for me.” “I’m very passionate about what I design, and there are some beautiful pieces.” When they got together in the late 1990s, the Trumps say their chemistry was instant. “We were both at the same party and that’s how we met. He came to me...” “Like her right away?” “I went crazy.” Melania and Donald became synonymous with the New York social scene. “They’ve stood did together for a number of years now. New Yorkers have come to know them as a very solid couple.” And in 2005, they married. “Hi, fans. I’m going to Metropolitan Gala.” In the following years, Melania’s social media posts focused on fashion, travel, fitness and spending time with family. Now as the first lady, next to one of the most outspoken presidents in recent history, Melania’s silence has taken on a life of its own. “The most important thing is just to be you. That’s the end.”",

The reality star responded to a fan Friday who pointed out the buzz circulating that she was going to give her baby the floral-inspired name.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Rose is so cute but no that’s not on my list,” Kardashian replied on Twitter.  The rumors likely came out of the fact that Kardashian, 33, frequently posts photos of luxurious rose arrangements to her social media — usually in shades of pink and white.

On Thursday, Kardashian narrowed it down even further, telling one fan on Twitter, “I think im going with a T.”  “@khloekardashian do you have a name picked out for your sweet baby girl yet?” another fan asked the Revenge Body star in early March.  “NO!!! It’s so hard!!!” Kardashian admitted. “Lol I knew the name if I was having a boy.

        "text": "BBMAS Drake Sets Single-Year Record, Celine Dion & Cher Shine at 2017 Billboard Music Awards  Drake stole the show at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in more ways than one, taking home 13 honors, surpassing Adele's mark as the artist with the most BBMA wins in one night, delivering a fiery performance in the middle of the famous Bellagio fountain and, maybe, getting himself a date after hitting on co-host Vanessa Hudgens during his acceptance speech for winning Top Billboard 200 Album for Views.  Watch  \"It's crazy that we're all here on earth for a limited amount of time, and we gotta show love while we're here,\" he said on stage midway through the telecast, before getting straight to the point: \"Vanessa Hudgens, you look incredible tonight.\" (Hudgens acknowledged that shortly afterward by asking if she was on the invite list for Drake's afterparty.)  By then, Drake had already racked up 12 BBMAs -- 10 in the pre-telecast categories, and one earlier in the show for Top Male Artist -- on his way to a record-breaking 13 victories, which he achieved with the evening's final honor, Top Artist, to overtake Adele's previous record of 12 in 2012. It's an impressive number for an artist who utterly dominated 2016, shattering streaming records over and over again with the success of his album Views and its monster single \"One Dance\" featuring WizKid and Kyla.  \"Life is like toilet paper,\" he said while accepting his final award. \"Either you're on a roll, or taking sh-t from assholes.\"  Cher was presented with the prestigious Icon Award and rolled back the years with a high-powered performance of her iconic songs \"Believe\" and \"If I Could Turn Back Time\" -- sporting, fittingly, completely different looks for each performance -- a day after her 71st birthday. \"I've wanted to do what I do since I was four years old, and I've been doing it for 53 years,\" she said with a humble air during her acceptance speech. \"I think luck has so much to do with with my success... I think it was mostly luck and a little bit of something thrown in.\"  Drake also won Top Hot 100 Artist, Top Billboard 200 Artist and Top Rap Artist, and took home awards for song sales, song streams and several rap and R&B categories on his way to lucky 13. Beyoncé earned Top Female Artist, Zayn was awarded Top New Artist and Blake Shelton (Country), Beyoncé (R&B), Twenty One Pilots (Rock), Juan Gabriel (Latin), The Chainsmokers (Dance/Electronic) and Lauren Daigle (Christian) and Kirk Franklin (Gospel) won top artist honors in their respective genres. Twenty One Pilots and Beyoncé were also big winners on the night, with five BBMAs apiece, while The Chainsmokers earned four.  The show spent most of its three hours, fittingly, on performances and awards rather than hosting gimmicks, with 15 performances that ran the gamut of genres from hip-hop to pop to dance to rock to country. Nicki Minaj opened the show with a star-studded medley that included her Remy Ma diss track \"No Frauds,\" which she performed with Lil Wayne, David Guetta's \"Light My Body Up,\" Jason Derulo's \"Swalla\" and her own \"Regret In Your Tears,\" bringing out each superstar in turn. Camila Cabello and Miley Cyrus both delivered the live debuts of their new singles -- Cabello's first solo songs since leaving Fifth Harmony, an emotional-yet-brief \"I Have Questions\" and a heated-up \"Crying In the Club,\" and Cyrus' country-tinged comeback release \"Malibu\" -- while Lorde (\"Green Light,\" performed as if at a goofy and awkward karaoke night), Sam Hunt (\"Body Like a Back Road\") and John Legend (\"Surefire\"), who was then joined by Florida Georgia Line for a surprise joint rendition of FGL's \"H.O.L.Y.,\" all chipped in with memorable performances.  Hudgens was a natural in her first year as co-host alongside veteran BBMAs host Ludacris, and their monologue would have had her in the headlines regardless of Drake's unabashed flirting. In hyping the performances to come, Hudgens showed off both her pipes and rapping skills with a cappella versions of Celine Dion's \"Power of Love\" and Nicki Minaj's verse from \"Monster,\" impressing both Luda and the crowd in the process.  Speaking of Dion, the diva performed her iconic song \"My Heart Will Go On\" 20 years after its initial prominence as the main song from the blockbuster Leonardo DiCaprio-Kate Winslet film Titanic, navigating the challenging track effortlessly and earning an extended standing ovation. (Read Billboard's oral history of the song right here.) It was easily one of the standout moments of the night, and impressive in its emotion and vocal dexterity.  Diddy also took the stage to pay tribute to The Notorious B.I.G. on what would have been the rapper's 45th birthday and debuted the trailer for his upcoming Bad Boy Records documentary Can't Stop, Won't Stop. \"It all started with the Notorious B.I.G.,\" Diddy said, referencing Bad Boy's creation and the 500 million albums it sold over the past 20-plus years. \"Big sold over 25 million records worldwide;...",

Smith launched a tweetstorm criticizing the HFPA and the nominations process Tuesday, saying she was \"discouraged,\" and accusing the nominating body of not having watched the movie.  \"Girls Trip was one of the most successful films this summer & Tiff was hands down the funniest person on screen in 2017 and we couldn't get eyes on the film or a press conference. How could a nom happen & how much more critical acclaim must a movie have to simply get a screening?\" she tweeted.  However, a source with knowledge of the situation not authorized to comment publicly confirmed to USA TODAY that there was an official screening on July 18 for the HFPA, and members were also invited to the premiere.  Haddish's awards season chances looked golden after the breakout star earned a supporting actress win from the New York Film Critics Circle and Critics' Choice Awards nominations for Girls Trip. Yet, those precursor honors didn't translate into any Globes nods.  Golden Globes 2018 biggest snubs:'Wonder Woman,' Tiffany Haddish, 'The Big Sick'  More Tiffany Haddish:10 of our favorite breakout stars of 2017  Pinkett pointed to Hollywood's long history of excluding women and people of color from its highest echelons, explaining that Haddish's snub goes beyond just \"racism.\"  \"And I dare not invalidate all the many journalists and people from all walks of life who have supported this movie by defining the issue as simply... racism,\" she wrote, naming The Big Sick and Get Out as two other films starring people of color that were largely ignored at the Globes nominations. \"Hollywood has systems in place that must learn to expand its concepts of race, gender equality and inclusion in regard to its perceptions of art across the board.\"    ",

The initiative is a way to honor the victims of the Route 91 Harvest Festival shooting.  It's unclear where the gold pin initiative started, but each number carries its own significance: 851 is for the 851 people injured during the shooting on Oct. 1 at the 2017 Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas, Nev.; 58 is for the 58 people who were killed during the tragedy; and 1 represents unity.  \"You are with us every single night in every single town,\" explains a card about the gold pin initiative. \"#FansFirst #VegasStrong\"  Fans can expect to see many 2018 ACM Awards attendees donning the gold pins, both on the red carpet and during the awards ceremony. Rising star Jillian Jacqueline writes on Instagram that she is \"proud\" to be part of the movement.  Remembering the Victims of the Route 91 Harvest Festival Shooting  \"We can’t go back in time, but we can move forward with resilience. and the healing power of music is going to prove itself again and again,\" Jacqueline writes. \"Life is a precious thing that goes by all too fast ... and when someone’s is taken from them too soon, i can only believe that it’s our responsibility to lift their memory up with love as much as we can.\"  The 2018 ACM Awards ceremony will include an onstage tribute to the victims of the Route 91 Harvest Festival shooting as well. The show's producers have indicated that the moment will open the awards show, and that they worked with Jason Aldean -- who was onstage at Route 91 when the shooting began -- to put the tribute together. During rehearsals for the ceremony, Aldean and Thomas Rhett visited with survivors of the shooting.  The 2018 ACM Awards are set to air live on CBS beginning at 8PM ET. Reba McEntire will be hosting the show.  The Boot will be staying up late covering the most buzzed-about winners, fashion and moments at the 2018 ACM Awards.

Inside Angelina Jolie's Secret Plan To Woo Heartthrob Hemsworth It was 'no accident' the famous pair were seated together at the Golden Globes.  A year-and-a-half after her divorce from Brad Pitt, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal Angelina Jolie has her eyes set on Hollywood’s hottest hunk — Chris Hemsworth!  The A-list actress is said to be begging her team to cast her in a movie alongside the Thor heartthrob after she was seen cozying up to him at the Golden Globes.  A source tells Radar it was “no accident” that Jolie, 42, was seated next to Hemsworth, 34, at the star-studded event. “She really admires his work and thinks he’s a fantastic actor, so she’d like to star together in a movie in the near future.”  “Angie is preparing to get back in front of the camera and would love to work on another action film, with Chris as her hunky leading man!” snitches the informant.  While the couple would undoubtedly make a good paring for a movie together, sources claim “the whole thing is pretty fishy.”  “It hasn’t gone unnoticed that Angie swoons whenever she’s in Chris’ presence, and there’s growing talk she’s using this as a way of getting closer to him.”  As Radar previously reported exclusively, Angie was most recently linked to 38-year-old Cambodian rapper and filmmaker praCH Ly — who is a superstar in his homeland — after being introduced by their mutual friend Loung Ung.  But it appears she’s already moved on from Ly as she has her eyes set on Hemsworth!  We pay for juicy info! Do you have a story for RadarOnline.com?

Sex and the City’s Willie Garson Throws Major Shade at Kim Cattrall as He Wades Into Movie Controversy: 'Because I'm Toxic'  Sex and the City‘s Willie Garson is adding his voice to reports that Kim Cattrall was behind the cancellation of Sex and the City 3.  Garson, who played Carrie Bradshaw’s friend Stanford Blanch in the series and subsequent two films, implied in a tweet on Wednesday that Cattrall wasn’t being entirely truthful about her claims that she never wanted to do a third film.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Dear fans, because I’m ‘toxic’, I’m going to negotiate a contract for 6 months, not come to terms, then say I never wanted to do it anyway,” he wrote.  Cattrall, who played Samantha on the popular HBO series has previously slammed reports that her demands led to the movie being shelved.  But a source close to the situation maintains to PEOPLE that Cattrall was a key factor in the movie being shelved. “Kim is trying to distract from what this is about — which is this: Kim killed the movie,” says the source. Cattrall has claimed that she has refused to board a third film since 2016, but the source tells PEOPLE she “was negotiating as recently as this summer” to join the movie. (Studio Warner Bros. has not commented.)  A second source also told PEOPLE that the cast “have had their issues over the years.”  Image zoom Craig Blankenhorn/Hbo/Darren Star Prods./Kobal/REX/Shutterstock  During a sitdown with Piers Morgan for ITV‘s series Life Stories, Cattrall, 61, said that she had refused to board the movie multiple times throughout the past year. She also bashed reports by DailyMailTV that claimed the third movie was shelved because of Cattrall’s “outrageous demands” to the studio to produce other movies she had in development.  “It’s quite extraordinary to get any kind of negative press about something that I’ve been saying for almost a year of ‘no’ that I’m demanding or a diva,” Cattrall said, according to the Daily Mail. “The answer was always no and a respectful, firm, no.”  “I never asked for any money, I never asked for any projects,” she continued. “To be thought of as some kind of diva is absolutely ridiculous.”  Cattrall then called out Parker — who would have been a producer on the film: “And this is really where I take to task the people from Sex and the City and specifically Sarah Jessica Parker in that I think she could have been nicer.”  RELATED: Sarah Jessica Parker Admits She Begged to Get out of ‘Sex and the City’ – Before Falling for Carrie  Cattrall and Parker’s reps have not responded to a request for comment.  Parker told Extra that Sex and the City 3 had a “beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story.”  “It’s not just disappointing that we don’t get to tell the story and have that experience, but more so for that audience that has been so vocal in wanting another movie,” she said.  Rumors that Samantha, Carrie, Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) were reuniting for a new film — which would follow 2008’s Sex and the City and 2010’s Sex and the City 2 —had long swirled before Parker’s announcement that the movie was off.  Parker wasn’t the only one feeling regret for Sex and the City’s end. Garson also previously tweeted that he was “disappointed” for the crew members who counted on working on the third installment.",

It’s believed Brad and Jen – who rekindled their fairytale romance after Jen’s marriage to Justin Theroux ended earlier this year – have been on the rocks in recent weeks because of Brad’s controversial relationship with Neri Oxman.  Last month reports surfaced that Brad had been caught getting cosy with the beautiful young architect, leaving Jen feeling insecure and concerned about their relationship.  Added to this is the fact Jen’s also under immense pressure during her bitter divorce from Justin Theroux, from whom she split in February, and it’s a difficult time for the actress.  ‘She’s under a lot of stress at the moment, so... all these questions about a surprise pregnancy are the last thing she wants,’ adds the source.  ‘Not only is she going through a messy divorce, she’s having problems with Brad. Ever since his friendship with Neri went public, she’s been doubting their relationship and wondering whether he is serious about building a new life with her.  ‘Brad is desperately trying to convince Jen that they’re just friends and that he’s committed but Jen just isn’t buying it.  ‘She’s very wary of him – after all, it feels like only yesterday that he cheated on her with Angelina and destroyed their marriage.  ‘While Jen is hopeful that she and Brad will work things out, she’s also preparing herself for the fact that she may have to raise this baby alone. She has always said that she would be happy to be a single mother if that’s how everything worked out,’ reveals the insider.  After her split from Justin earlier, People magazine reported that having kids was always part of her plan during their marriage.  ‘She had been sad it never happened,’ a source told the magazine. ‘But it never consumed her.’  But since their separation, Jen has realised that her window for having a child is closing fast, making this baby buzz a beautiful surprise.  ‘This could be a dream come true for her, and she’s not going to let troubles with Brad ruin it. If she winds up alone, that’s absolutely fine with her. All she wants is a baby.’  Over the years, Jen has always dreamed of having a child, so the pregnancy is clearly everything to her.  In the past, she has lashed out at suggestions that she chose her Hollywood career over becoming a mum: ‘This continually is said about me: that I was so career-driven and focused on myself; that I don’t want to be a mother and how selfish that is,’ she told Allure.  Denying that was the case, she said: ‘No. Even saying it gets me a little tight in my throat.’  For the full story, and to see more exclusive pictures of Jen's baby bump, see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!",

        "text": "The Kardashian family isn’t pleased with Rob’s Instagram and Twitter drama-meltdown. As CI readers know, on Wednesday, Rob went on a rant attacking his ex, Blac Chyna, where he accused her of cheating on him.  The Keeping Up With The Kardashian’s star continued to release “revenge porn” type photos and videos to embarrass the woman.  If that wasn’t enough, Rob went on to accuse her of being a “crazy person,” “disrespectful,” and claimed she spent tens of thousands of dollars on cosmetic alterations.  According to the reality star, he spent over $100,000 on plastic surgery for his baby momma.  The Kardashian brother threatened Chyna, saying that she won’t be able to see their daughter ever again unless she stops drinking alcohol and consuming narcotics like “cocaine, X, and E.”  And what did Chyna have to say about all of this?  She responded with some drama of her own, alleging that Kardashian beat her.  However, she has since deleted the Snap where she made the initial accusation.  A source revealed today “the entire family was very disappointed in Rob’s actions yesterday. All of the sisters are trying not to react publicly, and are working to brush it under the rug.”  The insider added that Kris Jenner is the one who is the most upset.  “She is very distraught,” the insider revealed, and “Kourtney Kardashian is in her own little world with Younes Bendjima, and Khloe is busy with her boyfriend Tristan Thompson. They don’t have time for Rob’s drama, but they do want what is best for Rob’s child, Dream. They are afraid Rob’s outburst will affect Blac and Rob’s baby.”  The Kardashian family knows what he did was wildly inappropriate, but they still stand by him, because after all, he is family.  Things might be getting worse for Rob, considering Blac’s attorney Walter Mosley said to E! News that they might take legal action against the reality star for releasing “revenge porn.”  Advertisement  As CI readers know, Mischa Barton is currently battling her own case regarding the leaking of inappropriate “private” footage of her in the bedroom. Times are changing, and a person can’t release private images to harass another individual anymore without legal repercussions. What do our readers think of this fiasco? Is Rob out of line or does Chyna deserve it? Perhaps, it’s both?",

        "text": "The tragic, unexpected death of Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington was ruled a suicide by hanging on July 20, when his body was discovered in his Los Angeles home. On Tuesday (Dec. 5), further details have emerged detailing the conditions of Bennington’s death, via autopsy and toxicology results.  The findings, published through TMZ, show \"a trace amount\" of alcohol in the singer's system at the time of death. An earlier version of this story reported MDMA (ecstasy) was also detected, though TMZ now asserts that after Bennington's blood tested \"presumptive positive\" for the drug, two subsequent tests disproved this. A prescription bottle of Zolpidem (the generic version of the sleep aid Ambien) and a small amount of beer was also found in Bennington’s bedroom.  The report coincides with June’s suicide report. “Autopsy findings are characteristic of suicidal hanging,” deputy medical examiner Dr. Christopher Rogers’ report reads. “There was a history of suicidal ideation [in Bennington].“  The Linkin Park frontman had battled depression and alcoholism throughout his life and attended rehab in 2006. According to his longtime friend Ryan Shuck (who played guitar in Bennington’s side project Dead by Sunrise) he had been six months sober at one point in 2017. While his friends said he was in good spirits and planning for the future through much of this year and last, he had also suffered alcoholic relapses over that time.  On Oct. 27, members of Linkin Park, Blink-182, No Doubt and numerous other stars held a tribute concert in Bennington’s honor at Los Angeles’ Hollywood Bowl. On Dec. 15, LP plans to release One More Light Live, featuring 2017 recordings from the band’s final shows with its fallen singer.",

They didn't announce the breakup on social media or anything, but Beckham did just introduce the paparazzi to Moretz's successor, 19-year-old model Lexi Wood.

The chorus of that song goes, per Genius, \"Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?/Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?/You gon' gain the whole world/But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?/Be careful with me/Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'.\" She followed that up with three cute photos of herself...coincidence or secret message?

Breaking up is hard to do when kids on the internet are invested in your real-life relationship.

        "text": "This article is about the series that aired between 2009–2012. For the 2018 series, see Jersey Shore: Family Vacation  Jersey Shore is an American reality television series that ran on MTV from December 3, 2009, to December 20, 2012, in the United States. The series follows the lives of eight housemates at a vacation home: in Seaside Heights, New Jersey in seasons one, three, five and six, South Beach, Florida in season two and Florence, Italy in season four, respectively.  The show debuted amid controversy regarding its use of the terms \"Guido/Guidette\", its portrayal of Italian-Americans and allegations of perpetuating stereotypes, as well as criticism from locals that the cast members were not residents of the area.[1][2][3][4] (Most were from New York, and at least two of them were not Italian.)  The show became a pop culture phenomenon, with classes and conferences at universities about the show, and journalists listing it as one of the most notable shows of the time. The Shore franchise spawned several international adaptations in other countries. Four of the Jersey Shore cast members received spin-off shows on MTV, with the most successful being Snooki & JWOWW . Most of the cast would go on to appear in other reality programs or receive their own shows on various networks.  On August 20, 2017, a one-off television special called Reunion Road Trip: Return to the Jersey Shore aired on the E! network.[5][6] On November 27, 2017, MTV announced that the cast (with the exception of Giancola) would be reuniting in Miami, Florida, for a new reunion series titled Jersey Shore: Family Vacation.[7] The series premiered globally on April 5, 2018. According to MTV, it is considered a new series and not the seventh season of the original show.[7][8]  Overview  Season Episodes Originally aired First aired Last aired 1 9 December 3, 2009 ( ) January 21, 2010 ( ) 2 13 July 29, 2010 ( ) October 21, 2010 ( ) 3 13 January 6, 2011 ( ) March 24, 2011 ( ) 4 12 August 4, 2011 ( ) October 20, 2011 ( ) 5 11 January 5, 2012 ( ) March 15, 2012 ( ) 6 13 October 4, 2012 ( ) December 20, 2012 ( )  Cast  Production history  VH1 producer Anthony Beltempo proposed the idea of a show focusing on the \"guido\" lifestyle for TV, in the form of a competition series. Executive producer SallyAnn Salsano, who previously worked on A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila, devised a new concept, inspired by her own summers in a Jersey summer shore house, and retained casting director Doron Ofir to find the cast. MTV Networks President Van Toffler felt that the series \"loud, young, bold\" style was better suited to MTV's sensibilities than VH1, and MTV programming executive Tony DiSanto felt that \"[After The Hills], it was time to go for a more authentic approach, like a documentary.\" Van Toffler described the casting process by saying they looked for \"candor, honesty, boldness and a very combustible, chaotic mess. You could honestly say none of these people were traditionally beautiful.\"[17]  Paul \"DJ Pauly D\" DelVecchio and Mike \"The Situation\" Sorrentino during shooting in Florence, Italy in May 2011.  The series follows the lives of eight housemates spending their summer in a summer share in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, known as The Jersey Shore House, as well as other locations in other seasons. Residences include a confessional room for cast members to self-record their thoughts on daily house drama. Season 1 followed cast members Angelina Pivarnick, Jennifer Farley, Michael Sorrentino, Nicole Polizzi, Paul DelVecchio, Ronald Ortiz-Magro, Samantha Giancola, and Vincenzo Guadagnino at the Jersey Shore. Jersey Shore premiered on December 3, 2009, with back-to-back episodes, averaging 1.375 million viewers.[43] Although the initial ratings were considered unimpressive to Salsano, they slowly grew in popularity, and was the subject of parody on Saturday Night Live after the third week, a turnaround that MTV executive Tony DiSanto calls \"the fastest 0 to 60 I've ever seen on a show\".[17] Season 1 posted strong growth every week and ranked #1 in its time period versus all cable competition among P12–34 (people 12 to 34 years old) during the first quarter of 2010, with a season high 2.6 rating for the finale.[44] The season 1 finale audience, 4.8 million, was more than triple that of the premiere, an increase of more than 3.4 million, and was MTV's highest rated original series telecast in almost two years.[44] Overall, the season 1 averaged 2.7 million viewers.[45]  In an article in Rolling Stone, it was mentioned that the house had 35 remote-controlled cameras in fixed locations, 12 hand-held ones, one IMX camera and six DV cameras.[46] Nicole Polizzi said that:  They have cameras everywhere, all the time ... You're always being watched. You kind of get a little paranoid, because you're like, 'Who's watching me?' ... It's trippy. it messes with your head. But that's why we go crazy. That's why we fight with each other. That's why we drink. We're living ...",

ET’s Katie Krause spoke with Brolin at the Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries winter Television Critics Association red carpet on Saturday, where he revealed that despite his decades-long romance, he still doesn't have all the answers.  “I don’t know, because nobody trains you,” he said of the secret to his and Streisand's marriage. “This is my third time -- third marriage. I picked difficult situations the first two times, but I think you learn with each one. I’m a person that believes that if I’m wrong, that’s when I learn, and when I’m right, I haven’t learned a thing.”  Noting that he takes his relationship “day to day,” Brolin revealed that he’s an advocate of marriage counseling.  “I do believe in counseling if anybody ever has a problem in their marriage. Bring in a referee, talk it over, and I swear to you, it will dispel by the end of the session, each time!” he said. “Sometimes in a tough marriage, it’s tough to talk, but if you do, it works!”  The 77-year-old actor has also learned to maintain his marriage with Streisand by not interrupting her during hectic times.  “When she’s busy, she’s really focused, and part of our good relationship is that I understand that,” he shared. “And if I come to her with something important and she says, ‘I don’t have time right now,’ she doesn’t have time, period. That’s the way the mind works. You gotta focus.”  As for how Streisand, 75, makes him feel special, Brolin said, “I’m always welcome when I get home. I always get notes, ‘Hurry home!’ When I get there, there’s always something kind of great waiting for me, some plan, and I try to reciprocate.”  RELATED CONTENT:  Barbra Streisand Calls Out Golden Globes for Not Awarding More Female Directors  ‘Girls Trip' Star Tiffany Haddish Says She Taught Barbra Streisand All About Cardi B  Josh Brolin on His Ripped Bod and How He Knew Wife Kathyrn Boyd Was the One (Exclusive)  EXCLUSIVE!

I Feel Like a Woman!\", and earned Twain four Grammy Awards. Her fourth studio album, Up! (2002), was also certified Diamond in the United States.  In 2004, Twain entered a hiatus, revealing years later that diagnoses with Lyme disease and dysphonia led to a severely weakened singing voice.[10][11][12][13] In 2011, she chronicled her vocal rehabilitation on the OWN miniseries Why Not? with Shania Twain, released her first single in six years, \"Today Is Your Day\", and published an autobiography, From This Moment On. Twain returned to performing the following year with an exclusive concert residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace, Shania: Still the One, which ran until 2014. In 2015, she launched the North American Rock This Country Tour, which was billed as her farewell tour.[14][15] Twain released her first studio album in 15 years in 2017, Now, and embarked on the Shania Now Tour in 2018.  Twain has received five Grammy Awards, 27 BMI Songwriter Awards, stars on Canada's Walk of Fame and the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and an induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.[16] According to the RIAA she is the only female artist in history to have three (consecutive) albums certified Diamond by the RIAA.[17] and is the sixth best-selling female artist in the United States. Altogether, Twain is ranked as the 10th best-selling artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era.[18]  Early life [ edit ]  Twain was born Eilleen Regina Edwards in Windsor, Ontario, on August 28, 1965,[19] to Sharon (née Morrison) and Clarence Edwards. She has two sisters, Jill and Carrie Ann. Her parents divorced when she was two and her mother moved to Timmins, Ontario, with her daughters. Sharon married Jerry Twain, an Ojibwa from the nearby Mattagami First Nation, and they had son Mark together. Jerry adopted the girls and legally changed their surname to Twain. When Mark was a toddler, Jerry and Sharon adopted Jerry's baby nephew Darryl when his mother died. Because of Twain's connection to Jerry, the media have incorrectly reported that she is of Ojibwe descent.[20] When questioned as to why she chose not to publicly acknowledge Edwards as her father for years, Twain stated:  My father (Jerry) went out of his way to raise three daughters that weren't even his. For me to acknowledge another man as my father, a man who was never there for me as a father, who wasn't the one who struggled everyday to put food on our table, would have hurt him terribly. We were a family. Step-father, step-brothers, we never used that vocabulary in our home. To have referred to him as my step-father would have been the worst slap across the face to him.[21]  Shania currently holds a status card and is on the official band membership list of the Temagami First Nation. In 1991, the singer was offered a recording contract in Nashville and applied for immigration status into the United States. At that time, by virtue of her stepfather Jerry Twain being a full-blooded Ojibwe and the rights guaranteed to Native Americans in the Jay Treaty (1795), Shania became legally registered as having 50 percent Native American blood.[21]  Twain has said that as a child she was told by her mother that her biological father was part Cree, a claim his family denies.[21] Her confirmed ancestry includes English, French, and Irish.[22][23] Through a maternal great-grandmother, she is a descendant of French carpenter Zacharie Cloutier.[24] Her Irish maternal grandmother, Eileen Pearce, emigrated from Newbridge, County Kildare.[25]  Twain has said she had a difficult childhood. Her parents earned little money, and food was often scarce in their household. Twain did not confide her situation ...",

That’s how it works!  Sofia really doesn’t seem to care that Scott still reminisces about his ex, though. “She appreciates Kourtney’s style and doesn’t mind borrowing fashion cues from her if it means keeping Scott happy,” the source told us.

Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson might be going through a major life change soon! No, we’re not talking about their rumored pregnancy — this is about the 26-year-old basketball player possibly being traded to a team in Los Angeles. Rumor has it that Tristan, who currently plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers, might be swapped with Los Angeles Clippers player DeAndre Jordan. If this were to happen, Khloe would be spending more time in her hometown, which we’ve EXCLUSIVELY learned is what she’s hoping for.  “Khloe is freaking out and totally excited about the possibility of Tristan being traded to an NBA team in Los Angeles,” a source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “It would be the best scenario for her to be able to be back in LA close to her family on a more full time basis. While Khloe loves spending time in Cleveland, there is no place like home.” See pictures of Tristan and Khloe here!  The source added that being close to family is more important now than ever due to the 33-year-old’s rumored pregnancy . “With a baby on the way, Khloe feels that having the love and support of her family now is more important than ever,” the source said. “In her own subtle way, Khloe has been gently encouraging Tristan to do everything in his power to get traded to a team in Los Angeles. A blockbuster NBA trade that would put her and her baby back in LA would make Khloe happy and relieved. Khloe wants her baby to be a California kid and grow up with her cousins and family close to her. Khloe feels family is the most important thing in the world, so she is hoping they get to move back to LA soon.” Switching to an LA team does seem pretty ideal for the couple — and if the reality TV star is looking to be closer to family, it definitely doesn’t hurt that her boyfriend would be playing for the same team as her sister Kendall Jenner ‘s man Blake Griffin  HollywoodLifers, do you want Tristan to be traded to the Clippers?",

        "text": "Who Is Prince Michael Jackson II?  Prince Michael \"Blanket\" Jackson is the third and youngest child of the late Michael Jackson. In 2015 he changed his name to Bigi Jackson. The identity of Prince's biological mother — a surrogate — is unknown. Jackson was seven years old when his father died on June 25, 2009.  Mother  The identity of Jackson’s biological mother, a surrogate, is unknown. He is the third child of pop legend Michael Jackson and allegedly the only biological child of the pop star, but no confirmation has ever been made.  Debbie Rowe, the mother of Michael's other two children — Paris Michael Katherine and Michael Joseph \"Prince\" Jackson — publicly denied being Blanket's biological mother, following his birth and subsequent media speculation regarding his conception.  Father’s Death  On June 25, 2009, Jackson's father, Michael, suffered cardiac arrest at his home in Los Angeles and died shortly thereafter. The pop star was 50 years old at the time of his death; Prince Michael Jackson II was seven.  Jackson's grandmother, Katherine Jackson, became his legal guardian, as well as the guardian of his siblings, Michael and Paris.  The three kids spoke to their father's fans during his funeral in 2009, and again in January 2010, accepting a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award for Michael Jackson at the Grammy Awards.  In February 2010, an official coroner's report on Michael's death was released, revealing that the singer had died from acute propofol intoxication. Aided by his personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, Michael had used the drug, among others, to help him sleep.  A police investigation revealed later that Murray hadn't been licensed to prescribe most controlled medications in California, and the doctor's actions as Michael's caretaker were subsequently further scrutinized. Murray was found guilty of homicide on November 7, 2011, receiving a four-year prison sentence.  Wrongful Death Lawsuit  Believing that A.E.G. Live — the entertainment company that promoted Michael Jackson's planned comeback concert, This Is It, in 2009 — had failed to effectively protect the singer while he was under Dr. Conrad Murray's care, the Jackson family decided to take legal action against the company. Katherine Jackson and Michael's three children officially filed a wrongful death lawsuit against A.E.G.  The trial began in April 2013. Lawyers sought up to $1.5 billion, an estimation of what Michael could have earned over the months since his death if he were still alive, in the case.  In October 2013, a jury determined that A.E.G. wasn't responsible for Michael's death. \"Although Michael Jackson's death was a terrible tragedy, it was not a tragedy of A.E.G. Live's making,\" said Marvin S. Putnam, A.E.G.'s lawyer.  Blanket’s Name Change to Bigi  In 2015, several reports surfaced that Jackson no longer wished to be called by his nickname, \"Blanket.\" Radar Online claimed that the young teen now wanted to be addressed as \"Bigi.\" He took the name after being bullied for years for his \"Blanket\" moniker.  Bigi Jackson Today  Jackson lives in Calabasas, California. He attends the Buckley School, a private school in Sherman Oaks, California. Due to his grandmother's advanced age, along with siblings Michael and Paris leaving the nest as young adults, Jackson is now under the supervision of older cousin T.J. Jackson.  While sources told People magazine that he had the hardest time of his siblings adjusting after his father’s death, he is now doing well, focusing on grades and sports and spending time with his more than 30 cousins.  Among Michael's kids, Bigi has generally stayed out of the spotlight. However, he made a rare appearance at older brother Prince’s graduation from Loyola Marymount College in Los Angeles in May 2019.",

The rapper was apparently pulled over for the lane change, not for tinted windows.  Offset is behind bars in Georgia after cops pulled him over and allegedly discovered at least one weapon.  Sources tell us the Migos rapper was traveling just outside Atlanta Friday when the vehicle he was in was pulled over for tinted windows. A witness tells us officers then discovered at least one gun in the car ... a big no-no for Offset, who is a convicted felon.  Offset and Cardi B welcomed their daughter, Kulture, into the world earlier this month ... we're told neither Cardi nor the baby were in the vehicle at the time of Offset's arrest.

Earlier this week, the “Swish Swish” singer, 32, was reminiscing about her time as a guest judge on The X Factor in 2010 when she determined the young singer’s fate on the show. Perry’s deciding vote pushed Horan forward in the competition, where he was later grouped with Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne and Zayn Malik to form One Direction.  One Direction's Craziest Antics! One Direction's Biggest Moments Through the Years  “Niall’s amazing. I love him, and I think we feel very connected in a way because I, like, have helped him get through The X Factor to join his group,” Perry told Australian radio show Fitzy & Wippa on Wednesday, June 28. “He’s become a big star and I’m like, ‘Cool, I guess that means I have taste?’ I don’t know what that means.”  The pop songstress went on to say that the 23-year-old might be romantically interested in her. “I see him around all the time,” she continued. “He’s always trying to like, get my number, to like, maybe flirt with me, but I’m like, ‘I could babysit you. I’m like your mom!’”  Horan responded to Perry’s flirting claims during his appearance on Australian TV show The Project on Thursday, June 28. “Katy, please stop being mean to me,” he joked. “She’s just finding any excuse now to just patronize me and go around spreading rumors about me. I just want to be your friend!”  He added that their age difference — 9 years — isn’t that drastic. “I mean, she is talking like she is about 55 years older than me,” he said. “She is not that much older than me.”",

Now that Pippa Middleton is pregnant with her first child and friends think Kate Middleton is pregnant with her fourth, the sisters are turning to each other for expert mom advice.  “They confide in each other about everything,” a source told Life & Style. “When they were younger they’d always share stories about boys and school life. Now they’re sharing pregnancy stories!”  Kate, who is already a mom to sons Prince George, 4, and Prince Louis, 2 months, and daughter Princess Charlotte, 3, is also helping her younger sister out with decorating her baby’s room. “She’s been giving Pippa lots of tips on what’s to come and helping her with the nursery,” the source added. “She’s also given Pippa some of George and Charlotte’s hand-me-downs but is obviously keeping some for Louis and her next baby.” The insider continued, “Kate and Pippa have had so much fun shopping online for baby clothes and accessories!”  When Kate gave birth to her third royal baby with husband Prince William on April 23, Pippa was one of the first people to meet the family’s new addition at Kensington Palace. So, now that Pippa, 34, is expecting her first little one with hubby James Matthews, the Middleton sisters are sure to be over the moon with baby joy! “Kate has so much knowledge to share,” a friend of the siblings recently revealed to Us Weekly. “She’s a walking baby encyclopedia at this point!”  The news of Pippa’s pregnancy first broke on April 21. “When Pippa found out she was pregnant, she was obviously thrilled and utterly overjoyed,” a source revealed to The Sun. “Naturally, big sister Kate and [her] parents, Carole and Michael [Middleton], were the first people she told — James aside — and they could not have been more delighted.”  Then, just weeks after Pippa showed off her baby bump at the royal wedding and the French Open in Paris, the socialite confirmed she’s expecting baby No. 1 on June 7. “I was lucky to pass the 12-week scan without suffering from morning sickness. That meant I was able to carry on as normal,” she wrote in her weekly column in Waitrose Kitchen Magazine. “When I learned the happy news that I was pregnant I realized I needed to adjust my 4 to 5-day-a-week [workout] routine. I’ve noticed my body change and weight increase, but through effective exercise and sports I feel that it’s been strengthened to support a healthy pregnancy, birth and recovery… and ensure that post-baby, my old favorite jeans will still fit eventually!”  Shortly after Pippa and James’ lavish May 2017 wedding, a royal insider told Life & Style that the couple was eager to start a family. “They are trying for a baby, and Pippa might already be expecting. I know she would love to be pregnant at the same time as Kate,” the source said at the time. “She would love to have a boy first and then a girl. She wants three children.” We’re so happy for the sisters!  Join our Facebook group for the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Prince William, and all things royal!",

        "text": "Monday's episode of \"American Idol\" was the season's most dramatic yet, as we learned which six of the 14 finalists had been voted through to the top 10 by America, and which of the remaining contestants had to sing for their lives in hopes of being chosen by the judges.  In the end, we had our top 10:  \"American Idol\" contestant, Catie Turner, performs on April 23, 2018. Eric McCandless/ABC  Catie Turner -- Chosen by America  Dennis Lorenzo -- Judges' pick  Michael J. Woodard -- Chosen by America  Jurnee -- Judges' pick  Gabby Barrett -- Chosen by America  Ada Vox -- Judges' pick  Maddie Poppe -- Chosen by America  Michelle Sussett -- Judges' pick  Cade Foehner -- Chosen by America  Caleb Lee Hutchinson -- Chosen by America  Michael J. Woodward on an episode of \"American Idol,\" which aired April 23, 2018. Eric McCandless/ABC  Here's how it went down:  There were two sets of chairs onstage: the Victory Zone and the Danger Zone. Over two hours, Ryan Seacrest revealed whether each contestant had been voted into the top 10 by America. Those who were voted through got to sing a song without being judged, and then take a seat in the Victory Zone. Those who weren't had to \"sing for their lives,\" and their fates were revealed at the end of the show.  Michelle Sussett, the first contestant in the \"Danger Zone,\" sang an original song called \"I'm a Dreamer,\" with lyrics in both English and Spanish, which made a powerful statement about the immigrant experience. \"This is my home and I love this country and I'm grateful to be here,\" the Venezuelan singer said. Judge Katy Perry was thrilled that she sang in Spanish, and she was the one who announced that she'd been chosen for the top 10.  Marcio Donaldson sang \"Jealous\" by Nick Jonas and it wasn't his best performance. You could tell from the judges' comments that there was no way they were putting him through.  Garrett Jacobs sang \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain\" by Creedence Clearwater Revival and, though Perry said it was the best he'd ever sounded, he wasn't chosen.  Dennis Lorenzo sang Maxwell's version of the Kate Bush song \"This Woman's Work.\" Perry called the performance \"brilliant\" and \"dynamic\" and said she'd fight for him; Lionel Richie said he didn't know what America was thinking by not putting him through. Luke Bryan was the one who announced he'd been chosen for the top 10.  Jonny Brenns sang a compelling version of \"Demons\" by Imagine Dragons that got him a standing ovation from the judges; Perry praised him for looking like a rock star, but criticized him for not having enough stage presence. In the end, he failed to make it through.  Mara Justine sang \"Love on the Brain\" by Rihanna, which made Bryan say he was \"in shock\" that she wasn't voted through by America. But Perry told the young teen that sometimes it's just about timing, which was a big giveaway that she wasn't going to be chosen.  Jurnee sang \"Never Enough\" from \"The Greatest Showman.” Richie simply said, \"I love you\" and he announced that they'd picked her for the top 10.  Ada Vox was the last contestant to sing for their lives, and sang \"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going,\" so memorably delivered by \"American Idol\" alumna Jennifer Hudson in \"Dreamgirls.\"  To say Vox brought the house down is an understatement; after the performance, Perry took off her earrings and announced that she and the other judges were making an executive decision: They ordered Vox to go to the Victory Zone immediately.  After Vox was chosen, the remaining seven contestants had to wait to hear which three would be staying. After Jurnee, Dennis and Michelle were declared the lucky ones, the rest of the pack were told by Perry, \"Over 10 million people are watching this. So what are you going to do with that information? You're going to launch off on your own.\"  The top 10 will perform Disney's greatest hits Sunday, and there will be the first-ever, coast-to-coast, live vote, with the results coming at the end of the show.",

        "text": "Swedish four-piece take to Instagram to announce two releases that will form part of an ‘avatar tour project’  Abba have announced that they have written and recorded their first new songs since they split in 1983.  The Swedish four-piece, who had nine No 1 hits in the UK between 1974 and 1980, and who have sold hundreds of millions of records worldwide, announced on Instagram that they had recorded two new songs for a project in which avatars of the band will perform.  Abba's return will be either genius or disaster – but nothing in between | Alexis Petridis Read more  The band said in a statement: “The decision to go ahead with the exciting Abba avatar tour project had an unexpected consequence. We all felt that, after some 35 years, it could be fun to join forces again and go into the recording studio. So we did. And it was like time had stood still and we had only been away on a short holiday. An extremely joyful experience!”  One of the two new songs that resulted, called I Still Have Faith in You, will feature in a TV special to air in December.  The statement concluded: “We may have come of age, but the song is new. And it feels good.”  Abba’s Björn Ulvaeus revealed details of the band’s forthcoming project in Brussels earlier this week. The centrepiece is the two-hour TV show co-produced by NBC and the BBC, which will see the band perform as computer-generated avatars. Ulvaeus said the band had been digitally scanned and “de-aged” to look like they did in 1979, when they performed their third and final tour.  The avatars are then set to tour the world from next year.  Abba formed in Stockholm in 1972. They comprised two couples: Ulvaeus and Agnetha Fältskog; and Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, all of whom had enjoyed musical careers in Sweden. The group burst on to the international stage after winning the Eurovision song contest in Brighton in 1974 with their song Waterloo.  From the mid-70s until they split, Abba built up a formidable arsenal of global hits including Knowing Me, Knowing You, Take a Chance on Me, Dancing Queen and The Name of the Game – all of which reached No 1 in the UK.  Fältskog and Lyngstad were the lead singers; Andersson and Ulvaeus composed the songs. Never less than impeccably produced and performed, Abba’s records were critically disdained at the time, but their popularity has endured. Their 1992 compilation Abba Gold has sold 30m copies – more than 5m of those in the Britain – and spent 833 weeks in the UK album charts.  Their jukebox musical Mamma Mia! debuted in the West End in 1999 and is still running both in London and worldwide; its website claims that it has been seen by 60 million people in 440 cities.  The stage show was adapted into a film in 2008, which grossed $615m (£447m) worldwide. A sequel, Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again, will be released in June. The actor Lily James – who is set to appear alongside the cast of the first film including Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried and Colin Firth – told the BBC last week: “There’s lot of songs in there, lots of new ones. Lots of ones, actually, that weren’t in my repertoire of Abba and I think they’re going to be huge hits again, and reawaken the love of Abba.”  Abba’s split in 1983 followed the divorces of both couples. Ulvaeus and Andersson went on to write two musicals, including Chess – a revival by the English National Opera opens on Friday in London – before largely devoting themselves to Abba’s legacy. Fältskog and Lyngstad have kept much lower profiles, though Fältskog – long claimed to be a recluse – returned to pop music with an album, A, which was released in 2013.  The group have long held out against lucrative offers to reform – they were reported to have been offered $1bn to play a concert in 2000. In 2014, Ulvaeus told Billboard: “you will never see us on stage again … we don’t need the money, for one thing.”  Peter Robinson, editor of Popjustice, described the announcement as “the biggest pop news of the 21st century. Most fans grudgingly admired Abba’s refusal to record new music, but I think we all sometimes daydreamed about the band possibly, maybe, one day having a rethink at the right time, on the right terms and for the right reasons, which seems to be what’s happened here.” He added: “It’s a pop miracle.”",

The Chi creator, who also stars on Master of None with Aziz Ansari, opened up in an interview on KPCC's The Frame radio show about the recent allegation against her co-star -- with whom she shares an Emmy for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series -- and why there needs to be a \"re-education\" of what consent means.  \"Here's the truth — in every situation, it's not always black and white,\" the 33-year-old actress and filmmaker explained. \"And I know that's simple for people, and it's easy for people to [ask], 'Whose side are you on?' There are no sides, really, in some of these scenarios. I'm not on Harvey Weinstein's side, I'm not on Kevin Spacey's side. But I think you have to take each situation [individually]. You can't just say, 'Well, I'm on this person's team, or I'm on that person's team.' It doesn't work that way.\"  \"And I think if we're unwilling to have a dialogue, we're gonna continue to keep hitting our heads against the wall,\" she added. \"We have to start reeducating ourselves about what consent is, what's appropriate behavior at the workplace. We have to create codes of conduct. Those are things that we need.\"  \"'Cause also I think there's an element of — how do you know if you're breaking a rule if you aren't aware of the rules? Or how do you know what appropriate behavior is if no one's ever communicated to you what appropriate behavior is?\" Waithe posited. \"Even though some people may assume, 'Well, of course we all know what appropriate behavior is,' but some people may not know.\"  Education over just apologizing and moving on, Waithe feels, is key.  \"It's about really educating ourselves and not stepping in it and just [saying], 'Oh, I'm sorry. My bad' — and sort of keep going. But it's about really sitting with yourself and educating yourself in terms of what consent is, what it looks like, what it feels like, what it sounds like. And all of us starting to really act accordingly based on this new information that I think we have now,\" she explained. \"We all gotta start talking to each other, start educating each other.\"  Get more of her interview here.  The allegation against Ansari was published on Babe.net, where a 23-year-old photographer, who chose to remain anonymous, claimed that she and the 34-year-old actor went on a date in New York City in 2017, after which, she claimed they went to his apartment where they engaged in sexual activity, which she says left her feeling \"violated.\"  \"In September of last year, I met a woman at a party. We exchanged numbers. We texted back and forth and eventually went on a date. We went out to dinner, and afterwards we ended up engaging in sexual activity, which by all indications was completely consensual,\" Ansari said in a statement after the story came out.  \"The next day, I got a text from her saying that although 'it may have seemed okay,' upon further reflection, she felt uncomfortable,\" he continued. \"It was true that everything did seem okay to me, so when I heard that it was not the case for her, I was surprised and concerned. I took her words to heart and responded privately after taking the time to process what she had said.\"    \"I continue to support the movement that is happening in our culture. It is necessary and long overdue,\" he concluded, seemingly referencing the #MeToo movement as well as #TimesUp, which he supported at the Golden Globes, wearing both all black and the pin.

However, an insider told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY Angie also doesn’t want to see him with someone new.  “Even though [Angelina Jolie] wanted the split, she’s terrified Brad [Pitt] will move on and find love with someone new,” an insider told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “It’s one of those she can’t live with him, and she can’t live without him, things. Brad and Angie had scorching chemistry and she just can’t handle seeing him with another woman. She definitely gets very jealous.”  Oh, we are totally aware of the kind of chemistry that Brad, 53, and Angelina, 41, had when they were still together. Their 10-year romance was fiery from the very beginning — back when they were filming Mr. & Mrs. Smith while Brad was still married to Jennifer Aniston, 48.  The kind of passion they had on screen had fans wondering if they had a thing for each other. Those suspicions were confirmed when Brad left Jen for Angie and they embarked on a new life together in which they would have several children (both adopted and biological) and eventually get married.  But Angie decided to end that marriage in September 2016 and the two have since been stuck in the middle of a complex divorce and custody battle. With everything that is going on we can see why Angie has complicated feelings when it comes to Brad dating again.  “She’s definitely keeps an eye on him and what he’s up to,” the source added. “Besides just not wanting to see him with someone else, Angie really doesn’t want to see another woman come into the kids lives. That would really freak her out.”  “For now she doesn’t really have much to worry about, as Brad is focused on the kids, his health, art and his career,” the insider said. “Other than that he just doesn’t have interest in another relationship.” Well, at least we know that she has some time to get used to the idea before he starts bringing women home to meet the kids!  HollywoodLifers, when do you think that Brad will find someone new? Do you think he will ever want to date again? Give us all your thoughts below!",

        "text": "INDEPENDENCE, Ia. — Attorneys for reality TV star Chris Soules are negotiating with prosecutors on a possible deal to resolve his charge of leaving the scene of an accident.  Soules' attorney, Alfredo Parrish, said at a hearing Tuesday that \"we are pretty close to a resolution.\"  \"There’s been substantial discussions regarding this matter and we may be in position at least by Monday to let the court know where we are,\" Parrish said. Buchanan County Attorney Shawn Harden agreed with his assessment.  Parrish did not provide details of his discussions with prosecutors and there is no guarantee they will be able to reach a deal.  Soules, who starred on a season of ABC's \"The Bachelor,\" faces a felony charge of leaving the scene of a fatal traffic accident. He could face up to five years in prison for the charge and has pleaded not guilty.  Soules rear-ended 66-year-old Kenny Mosher of Aurora on April 24, 2017. Soules was driving a pickup truck and Mosher was on a tractor.  Soules called 911, administered CPR and remained on scene until paramedics arrived, but left several minutes later. Mosher was taken to a local hospital and later died.  Parrish's comments came during a pretrial conference at the Buchanan County Courthouse ahead of Soules' Nov. 7 trial.  Soules' attorneys have filed a motion to move his trial out of Independence because of the publicity the case has received and his status as a well-known local figure. They say he will not receive a fair trial unless the case is moved.  At Tuesday's proceeding, District Court Judge Andrea Dryer set an Oct. 30 hearing to resolve that motion. If the case stays in Independence, Dryer said, the trial will go forward on Nov. 7 as scheduled. If Dryer grants the motion to move the trial, she said the date will have to be pushed back because of the difficulty of finding courtroom space and a jury in another county on short notice.  It was after Dryer set a date for the hearing that Parrish said his team has been negotiating with prosecutors to resolve the charge without a trial. He said he would give Dryer an update by Oct. 22.",

'It's amazing...just incredible,' a friend gushed to the Enquirer. 'But they won't announce for some time, or until the end of the first trimester, as is the American custom.'  Another insider reportedly told the US publication, 'All the signs have been there for months now.  'It's wonderful news to be sure - but it shouldn't come as a shock to anyone.'  The Enquirer's shocking report claims 36-year-old Meghan secretly visited fertility doctors before her May 19 wedding to Prince Harry, who is sixth in line to the British throne.  'Harry and Meghan want to get pregnant as quickly as possible after their wedding,' a friend tells.  'They both know that as Meghan gets older, it can get increasingly harder to conceive - and they are both keenly aware of her vulnerability to health complications and the chance of miscarriage the older she gets.'  Along with fertility check-ups, Meghan also visited London-based nutritionist Melanie Brown at Kensington Palace, insiders told the Enquirer.  Brown, a 'specialist in fertility, IVF, and pregnancy,' who works out of Duke Street, gave Meghan pointers on 'pre-conceptual and pregnancy nutrition, including weight loss and gain, and immune issues.'  Harry, 33, also reportedly 'stepped up', meeting with nutritionist Gabriela Peacock on how he can drop weight and boost fertility.  Meghan and Harry's exciting baby news will mark the first time the monarchy has welcomed twins in almost 600 years.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's twin joy may have been the help of his genetics.  Harry's uncle, his mother Princess Diana's brother, Charles Spencer, has identical twin daughters. The royal's great-grandfather, Edmund Maurice Burke Roche, the fourth Baron Fermoy, was also an identical twin.  One insider told the Enquirer, 'We all know where the genes for twins comes from - and it wasn't the House of Windsor on Harry's side!  'You might romantically say this is Diana's last gift to her youngest son.'  Getty  A friend added to Life & Style, 'She just can't wait to be a mother.'  Harry is beyond eager to be a dad, added the source.  The palace insider claims that Her Majesty is also one of the most excited.  'She's been nagging Harry for months about how she can't wait for him to extend the family.  'She loves being a grandmother and a great-grandmother!'  The royal family is yet to respond to the reports.  The Royal Wedding Debrief! What happened after Meghan and Harry's big day? We talk through why their wedding will go down in history as one of the most entertaining and romantic. In the latest episode of the New Idea Royals podcast, Frances Sheen and royal expert Angela Mollard take you behind the scenes of the big day - from the bride's stunning dresses to the surprise guest list - and talk through all the highlights that kept us all riveted.",

The Rules of Engagement actor took to Instagram on Friday to jokingly unleash a massive list of fake grievances he has against Pitt. The motivation for the hilarious rant was the cover of a tabloid that claimed — with zero evidence — that his sister, actress Kate Hudson, is dating the Ocean’s Eleven star.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “He drinks out of the f— carton and he leaves the door open when he’s taking a dump!!” the 40-year-old actor jokingly vented. “And this is when he’s at MY house!!! He’s already calling me brother and has driven a wedge between myself and my real brother Wyatt who now won’t speak to me.”  Oliver went on to write even his mother, Overboard star Goldie Hawn, was “overtly flirting with him,” going around “wearing these little nighties around the house.”  “And Pa just keeps saying ‘All right!! It’s Brad Pitt!!'” the actor continued, adding “Anyway not going well.. so BP.. it’s time to move out man.. I need my life back dog.. I’ll smoke one more bowl and then get the f— out.”  The joke was lighthearted and seems to come at a time when Pitt is slowly but steadily making more public appearances. Pitt recently stepped out at a Malibu-held charity event, where he seemed in good spirits as he took photos with fans.  Pitt was seen shaking hands and making people laugh at the event, whose other famous guests included Charlie Hunnam, Rami Malek, Garrett Hedlund, Kaley Cuoco, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Scott Foley and David Spade.  Earlier this month, Pitt made a surprise appearance at the Golden Globes where he presented the film Moonlight, which his company produced. The critically acclaimed film won the Globe for best drama.  One day later, he and his ex Angelina Jolie released a joint statement stating that they have reached an agreement to handle their divorce privately and keep details confidential.",

        "text": "It's hard to believe that there have been five whole seasons of Botched, but the latest season promises to be filled with even more OMG moments — and we're ready. The show follows two top-notch plastic surgeons in California, Dr. Terry Dubrow, 60, and Dr. Paul Nassif, 56, who help people who have had past surgeries gone wrong.  Each patient on the show has an emotional explanation as to why they need their previous work fixed. These personal stories will range from multiple surgeries gone wrong in the past to getting operations done by untrained professions to going overseas to cut costs on pricey American procedures. This reality show has seen it all.  The doctors are usually willing to take on these high-risk patients, many of whom have been turned away by other doctors due to the extent of the cosmetic damages, but most fans still wonder if Botched pays for the extensive surgery — or if the patient has to cover the expense.  Source: E!  So, do Botched patients pay for the surgery? In a 2015 interview with Allure, Dr. Dubrow revealed, \"We have to get paid to do the surgery. For four days a week we do something for the show.\" Though, some may be wondering how every person on the show can afford an A-list plastic surgeon, rest assured, they aren’t paying the full bill. The medical professional also told the mag that E! pays every patient an appearance fee, which that person then puts towards their medical fee. Well, that's nice of the network. Source: E!  How much do the Botched surgeons make? As any professional in the medical field, they are not strapped for cash. In fact, these two plastic surgeons are among the highest paid in their field. According to MoneyInc.com, Dr. Dubrow is worth $30 million and has cemented himself as a top plastic surgeon in California. He has also appeared on multiple reality television shows, including, The Real Housewives of Orange County, alongside wife Heather Dubrow, The Swan, and a spinoff of Botched titled Botched by Nature. In the same article, Dr. Nassif is said to be worth $14 million. He is best known for his rhinoplasty work and helping his clients achieve the \"perfect nose,\" as well as starring alongside Dr. Dubrow in Botched. Fans of reality television will also remember that Dr. Nassif was previously married to former RHOBH star Adrienne Maloof, — the former couple share sons Colin, Christian, and Gavin — who also has an impressive net worth of her own, estimated at $300 million.

        "text": "Does it look corny AF? Yup. Are we going to watch? You betcha  Our favourite Bachelor hotties are returning for another shot at love—and this time it’s going international.  The new Bachelor spinoff, The Bachelor Winter Games, debuts on Feb. 13 at 8:00 EST and is basically a show where contestants compete in a series of winter-themed challenges for a chance to win the ultimate prize: love. *Cue eye rolls now* The show, described as “different and fun” by host Chris Harrison, is a four-part series filmed in Manchester, Vermont, at what producers call a “luxurious winter resort.” (Basically, it’s a fancy AF space for cozy rendezvous, cuddle sessions and, obviously, drama.)  While we’re stoked that some of our fave Bach Nation contestants will be taking part (hello Eric Bigger!), we don’t know a heck of a lot about this new *reality* show. So, we did a deep dive into The Bachelor Winter Games and this is everything we learned so far about the show we will complain about non-stop while compulsively watching. You’re welcome.  When it airs  Clear your calendars, babes. The four-parter airs from 8:00 EST to 10:00 EST on Tuesday, February 13, Thursday February 15, Tuesday February 20 and Thursday February 22 on ABC. That means—including Arie’s season—there will be six hours of Bachelor Nation programming on the weeks of February 12 and 19. We are seriously not sure if we can handle it all, HBU?  Here’s how the game works  Ten former Bachelor/Bachelorette contestants from the United States along with 14 contestants from overseas editions of The Bachelor—including Australia’s Tiffany Scanlon, Canada’s Benoit Beausejour Savard and New Zealand’s Jordan Mauger—will compete for “date cards” that they can use to pursue romantic one-on-ones with fellow competitors. How does one win a date card, you ask? Simple. By showing off one’s skiing, biathlon and ice-dancing skills.  According to a press release by ABC, the competitions will “test the contestants’ perseverance in pursuing relationships with one another while faced with language barriers and cultural differences.” Producer Mike Fleiss hopes the games will “create a global celebration of unity and love.” Hey, if that means we get to see Ben Higgins’s winter bod we’re alllllllll for it.  The special guests are insane  In case you are bummed about missing some of the actual Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea (which will air at the same time), you can get your athlete fix with special appearances by world figure skating champions Tai Babilonia and Randy Gardner, and Olympic figure skater Nancy Kerrigan. Other special appearances include former Bach contestants and forever lovebirds Trista and Ryan Sutter, who will kick off the games as “grand marshals,” former Bachelorettes Rachel Lindsay and JoJo Fletcher, and current Bachelor Arie Luyendyk Jr.  These are the contestants we are most stoked to see  Ben Higgins  Our hearts filled and then eventually broke for season 20 Bachelor Ben and his now-ex Lauren Bushnell. But hey, if Ben can’t find love in Vermont, Amy Schumer seems to dig him.  Ashley Iaconetti (a.k.a. Ashley I)  C’mon. As if we wouldn’t be excited for the return of infamous Kim Kardashian-esque crying Ashley! It’s been too long since we saw her on Bachelor in Paradise seasons 2 and 3. And if the games are anything like the promo suggests, there will be plenty of tears ahead.  Eric Bigger  Sweet, charming, sexy Eric was a fan favourite on Rachel Lindsay’s season of The Bachelorette. He wasn’t lucky enough to capture her Final Rose, but will her guest appearance bring up old feelings? WE HOPE SO.  Luke Pell  We still have a serious bone to pick with Luke about his not-so-cute f-ckboy tendencies, so we will be watching to see if he’s improved his behaviour.  Dean Unglert  He won our hearts when he showed his sensitive side on Rachel’s season of The Bachelorette, but got a bad boy reputation on Bachelor in Paradise season 4 when he tried to date BOTH Kristina Schulman and Danielle Lombard. Which Dean will we get this time?  How do Bach fans feel?  Many fans are stoked for the triumphant return of our favourite Bachelor babes  OH MY GOD BACHELOR WINTER GAMES???

We could guess it had something to do with backup dancers, as Swift previously told Rolling Stone her song “Bad Blood,” rumored to be about Perry, was about a singer “who basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour.” Facts were scant, though. Even with Perry’s “Swish, Swish,” a song rumored to be about Swift that debuted last week (more than a year after Swift’s track), we didn’t know the full story. Now it’s coming at you like a dark horse. During an extended “Primetime Carpool Karaoke Special” on Monday night, Perry opened up about everything to host James Corden.  According to Perry, the feud started because some of her usual dancers wanted to perform with Swift. Perry said she had no problem with the dancers’ choice, but to make sure their contracts included a provision allowing them to drop out of Swift’s ensemble when Perry went back on tour in a year or so. Well, when the time came for Perry to prepare for her tour, the dancers went to Swift’s management to discuss leaving ― and got fired. “She started it, and it’s time for her to finish it,” Perry told Corden. The singer said she tried to speak to Swift about the issue but noted, “She wouldn’t speak to me.” The singer continued, “It was a full shutdown, and then she writes a song about me, and I’m like, OK, cool, cool, cool, that’s how you want to deal with it? Karma!” Then Perry went off like a firework: But what I want to say is that I’m ready for that BS to be done. Now, there is the law of cause and effect. You do something, and there’s going to be a reaction, and trust me, Daddy, there’s going to be a reaction. It’s all about karma, right? ... I think, personally, that women together, not divided, and none of this petty bullshit, women together will heal the world. Preach!",

While Broadway stars get up on stage in front of hundreds of people every night, that doesn’t stop them from experiencing mental health struggles. Patti Murin, who plays Princess Anna in the musical Frozen, opened up about her rough journey with anxiety after having to cancel a performance on Tuesday night (April 17).  “So last night I called out of the show because I had a massive anxiety attack in the afternoon,” the actress wrote in an Instagram post on Wednesday. “It had been building up for a while, and while the past month has been incredible, all of the ups and downs and stress and excitement really takes a toll on my mental health.”  “Anxiety and depression are real diseases that affect so many of us. It requires a lot of rest and self care to heal every time it becomes more than I can handle in my daily life,” she continued.  She also took the opportunity to encourage a positive outlook for her followers who might be experiencing the same things. “Just remember that you’re not alone, your feelings are real, and this is not your fault. Even Disney princesses are terrified sometimes.”  See the post below.",

        "text": "\"I would hate for my biggest enemy to go through what I’ve been through this summer,\" DeMario Jackson tells THR.  Millions of viewers were anxiously awaiting the premiere of Bachelor in Paradise, but DeMario Jackson was personally invested in how the TV saga would play out.  Speaking candidly to The Hollywood Reporter, Jackson says he feels \"relieved\" now that the ABC summer spinoff series has addressed the controversy that featured him and fellow contestant, Corinne Olympios, in the leading roles off-camera for nearly two months this summer.  \"I think people wanted it to be something different,\" Jackson, 30, who is black, says of his on-set encounter with Olympios, 25, a white contestant. \"They wanted the angry black guy and this little, innocent white girl. But it wasn't that.\"  The moment in question was a taped sexual encounter between the two contestants, who had both been drinking, that occurred in the hot tub at the show's Sayulita, Mexico, resort. A producer, who according to Jackson never saw the moment or the footage, filed a misconduct allegation, forcing producers Warner Bros. Television to suspend production to investigate. A second producer later filed a similar complaint. After nearly two weeks, where an outside firm watched all footage and interviewed the entire cast and crew, WBTV concluded there was no wrongdoing and the show resumed filming, this time without Jackson or Olympios.  Before the cast officially kicked off the second round of Paradise, they sat down with host Chris Harrison to discuss what happened, placing blame on inaccurate reporting and clearing the show's producers of any culpability. The scandal, they agreed, blew up into a national sensation because of vague statements and quick assumptions, largely motivated by race. Jackson, who says he harbors no ill will toward Olympios, agrees with their takeaway. If he was white, or if Olympios was black, \"we wouldn’t even be having this discussion at all,\" he says.  Though he was there for the encounter with Olympios — something he says he remembers fully and describes as \"100 percent consensual\" from both parties — and the production shutdown, he still has questions. He also sat down with Harrison for a one-on-one interview that will air next week, with Olympios telling her side of the story in a sitdown that airs the following week.  In a wide-ranging chat with THR below, Jackson shares his account of the events that took place at Paradise, details how his life has been impacted since and explains why he feels ABC has been \"woke as hell\" with how they've handled the entire situation, despite any criticism and his decision not to return.  Now that the footage has aired and Bachelor in Paradise addressed what happened, how do you feel?  I'm relieved. My story has never changed. I'’ve never cracked. I've never been angry or upset. I just told my truth. Unfortunately, we live in a society where the whole world is going to side with the woman. Even when the story doesn't make sense. In this situation, I don't think people used common sense. You're on a multimillion-dollar set with 50 to 100-plus cameras, 300 workers and an entire production. I love how [castmate] Alex [Woytkiw] was giving the play-by-play with what was going on with me and Corinne when we were in the pool, because it showed all the production, all the people and the castmates watching. I was actually telling the truth, so I'm relieved.  I'm hoping you can clear up the timeline. We knew the actual tape was never going to air, but viewers seem to be confused about when the encounter in question actually happened.  It happened right there, that afternoon. When Alex was giving the play-by-play to the cameras.  We did see you both after that, when the cast gathered to welcome Wells Adams to the show (pictured below). How would you characterize your interactions with Olympios from then on?  We were fine. We were fine throughout the whole day. You saw us the next morning when we had breakfast. Even that night before we got pulled away, I gave her the fist-bump. Even today, after all of this, I'm still sitting here confused. I still feel like I'm missing 25 percent of the story, even though I'm in the story. (Laughs.) I'm still sitting here saying, \"Wait a minute, what happened?\"  We saw the producers approach you and Olympios separately before everything shut down. When they walked up to you, what did you think they were going to say?  Even when I was pulled away, I didn't think [about] the Corinne situation. I was thinking, \"What is going on?\" I wondered if the girl from The Bachelorette was back. When I spoke to production, I asked, \"Did Corinne say something?\" They said no. I asked, \"Did I say something?\" They said no. I said, \"So why the fuck are we having this conversation?\" This third-party who wasn't present and who didn't view the video can just say she wants to shut down the production? It didn't make sense to me.  The \"third-party\" you are referring to is a produ...",

        "text": "Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez have remained friends for years despite the media spotlight that causes some celebrity relationships to splinter. After watching her friend go through heartbreak from the ups and downs that occurred in her romance with Justin Bieber, Taylor is definitely not a Belieber. With the “Sorry” singer aware that Swift dislikes him, Justin is blaming Taylor for the most recent crumbling of Jelena, according to Hollywood Life’s insider.  However, don’t look for any signs on social media or in interviews that the Biebs blames Swift.  “Justin knows Taylor doesn’t like him and never will and the feeling is mutual, but he is smart enough to know not to say anything in public or on social media because he knows all the scrutiny he’d endure,” explained the source.  Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez showcase their friendship. [Photo by Jason Kempin/Getty Images for iHeartRadio / Turner]  Swift recently attracted attention at the iHeartRadio Awards by throwing shade at the 22-year-old pop star after his performance, pointedly looking in the opposite direction. And the Biebs doesn’t believe that he and Taylor will ever become pals. In contrast, he will always blame Swift for any problems in his Jelena relationship, claims the insider.  “He never expects to be her friend and is not looking to be her friend. He blames Taylor for some of his issues with Selena and that will never go away.”  Is Taylor Swift to blame for separating Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber? [Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images]  But is Swift also to blame for any “issues” arising from the photos that circulated showing Gomez getting intimate with Orlando Bloom, who is Katy Perry’s boyfriend? Amid the blame game controversy that resulted, sources told Naughty Gossip that Gomez was the one who was “aggressive” to hurt Katy.  “Selena really likes him and was very aggressive to get him,” claimed one source. “You must remember that her best friend is Taylor Swift who hates Katy Perry. I can only imagine the things Taylor and Selena have said to each other about Katy.”  As to whether Swift actually orchestrated the hookup to make Perry feel bad, however?  “I doubt Taylor was behind this hookup, but you know these two have spoken about it since,” added the insider.  Katy Perry tweeted her views about the alleged cheating scandal involving Selena Gomez and Orlando Bloom. [Photo by Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images]  Taking it one step further, Wendy Williams used her talk show as a platform to claim that Swift pushed her pal to get intimate with Orlando, an allegation that Gossip Cop calls false.  “Selena is best friends with Taylor Swift. And Taylor is [a] low-key mean girl, doesn’t want to see anybody get anything,” slammed Wendy. “Katy, you need to be looking at your man…sicced on him by Taylor Swift. Taylor is just a [b***h].”  However, when it comes to Swift and the allegations of cheating, Taylor was never involved, according to Gossip Cop.  As for how Katy feels about this situation? Perry is dealing with it by turning to Twitter to challenge all those allegations, pointed out Vanity Fair.  Is that all there is? https://t.co/54Q72MfXND — KATY PERRY (@katyperry) May 12, 2016  Using social media to showcase her views, Katy tweeted a link to Peggy Lee’s song, “Is That All There Is?” and followed it with a link to an article about Bloom’s efforts as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador in Eastern Ukraine.  “Instead of giving energy & eyeballs to dumb conspiracy, check out how cool this is,” urged Perry. “#dontfeedthebeast.”  Instead of giving energy & eyeballs to dumb conspiracy ???? check out how C????????L this is: https://t.co/ClmGlPMz3x #dontfeedthebeast — KATY PERRY (@katyperry) May 12, 2016  Providing her own view on the situation, Gomez retweeted what Katy had posted, complete with a prayer hands emoji.  Just one week after all the scandal erupted over the photos showing Selena and Orlando getting cozy, Perry was seen cuddling and kissing her boyfriend on what the Daily Mail describes as a “romantic rendezvous in Cannes.”  Katy has been dating her actor boyfriend for four months, and their canoodling on a yacht at the French Riviera resort Sunday seemed to discount all those cheating rumors. Perry, 31, is in Cannes to perform at the amfAR Cinema Against AIDs benefit.  [Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images]",

        "text": "It turns out there may have been some truth to all the rumors about Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra's relationship. In a sweet Instagram story post on Friday, June 22, Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra went seemingly confirmed their relationship. Jonas posted the IG story video of Chopra, in which she walks toward the camera laughing, and the caption for it is simply: \"Her [heart-eyes emoji]. (Bustle reached out to Jonas and Chopra's reps for comment, but has not yet received a response.)  According to a People report on Saturday, June 23, Jonas and Chopra have been spotted together in Mumbai, India, where Jonas was reportedly going to meet Chopra's mother, Madhu. The rumored couple appeared in photos together taken in India that were published by the publication. People cited an unnamed source, who said the relationship was \"getting serious\" and \"They're very happy.\" Earlier this month, The Daily Mail published photos on June 11 of the rumored couple attending his cousin Rachel Tamburelli’s wedding in Atlantic City, New Jersey.  Additionally, Chopra and Jonas were spotted together in May at a Los Angeles Dodgers baseball game and attending the Beauty and the Beast concert at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, according to Us Weekly. An eagle-eyed Twitter user even posted a video of the Chopra and Jonas at the game. Jonas and Copra were also spotted together dining at Toca Modera in the Los Angeles neighborhood West Hollywood in May, according to E! News. (Bustle reached out to reps for Chopra and Jonas for comment when the rumors first began circulating, but did not receive a response.)  Fan reaction to Chopra and Jonas' reportedly confirmed relationship involved a lot of excitement.  Fans are using lots of heart-eye emojis themselves.  One fan got all the nostalgic feels.  Even one fan on Twitter is trying to figure out Chopra and Jonas' couple name.  Rumors of Jonas and Chopra's romance began circulating as far back as May 2017, when the duo attended the Met Gala together. In a 2017 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Kimmel asked Chopra if the Met Gala appearance together meant they were dating. Chopra explained to Kimmel, \"We were both wearing Ralph Lauren and we decided to go together. It was fun ... We were on the same table and we know each other, so we were like, 'Hey, you know what, let's go together.' And I was like 'OK, let's go together.' It ended up just working out.\"  As Chopra mentioned on Jimmy Kimmel Live, she and Jonas knew each other before attending the Met Gala. According to the Indo Asian News Service in December 2017, Jonas reportedly said in a statement in December 2017, \"[Chopra and I] met through a mutual friend, who she did Quantico with — this guy Graham — and we met up like, in New York the first time, and the same day I think we found out that we were both going to the Met Gala with Ralph Lauren.\" Graham could likely be Graham Rogers, who starred in Quantico with Chopra and the film Careful What You Wish For with Nick Jonas.  Jonas' also said in his statement to Indo Asian New Service that he would like to visit India one day. He said in the statement:  \"I've never been (to India). But I'm dying to go and I have now heard from Priyanka, my new friend a lot about it. Just given me a lot of names of place to go if I go there ... \"And as strange as it sounds but we couldn't have planned it [the Met Gala]. We just had a great time. She's a lovely person and I'm dying now to go to India.\"  And now, according to several news outlets, it looks like Jonas is visiting India with Chopra. Whether or not Jonas' sweet Instagram story is definitely confirming their relationship, it seems like Jonas and Chopra are having a great time together.",

        "text": "On Monday, rapper Bow Wow Instagrammed a picture of his private jet, ostensibly in order to inform New York’s ten CSI: Cyber fans of his imminent arrival. The post, innocuously captioned “Travel day. NYC press run for Growing Up Hip Hop [sic]. Lets goo,” easily blended in with the rest of Bow Wow’s aspirational Instagram content. The problem, of course, is that Bow Wow—or Shad Moss, as he would really like you to call him—isn’t exactly flush. In 2012, the rapper behind such hits as “Mo Money,\" \"Get Money,\" and “Money in the Way” proved that he would not let his public love of money get in the way of shirking his child support payments. In an infamous court session, Bow Wow claimed that after over two decades in the music industry, he was only making around $4,000 a month. Furthermore, he insisted that he only had $1,500 in his checking account—which, for some perspective, is the amount of money that Rick Ross has probably spent on lobsters today. By copping to his financial insolvency—while conveniently failing to disclose that he had just scored a hosting gig at BET—Bow Wow was able to argue that he would be incapable of paying his child’s mother any more than $3,000 a month.  Of course, the man still not known as Moss could very well have increased his assets over the past five years. Maybe he opened a 401(k). Maybe he invested his surplus $1,000 a month in Snapchat. Or, maybe, Bow Wow wasn’t actually flying private. That’s the theory put out by one Twitter sleuth, who spotted Bow Wow on his commercial flight and quickly uploaded the evidence to his feed. The surreptitious snap is captioned, “So this guy lil bow wow is on my flight to NY. But on instagram he posted a picture of a private jet captioned ‘traveling to NY today’ smh.” Another Internet investigator with some free time on their hands (Comey, is that you?) did a reverse image search on Bow Wow’s Instagram, which led to a photo from a Fort Lauderdale-based airport transportation website. In other words, it appears that the rapper pulled his sweet private plane from Google images. To Moss’s credit, he seems to have attempted to cover his tracks by running the picture through Amaro. But while an Instagram filter might make a sunset seem prettier or a sorority pledge class look tanner, it can’t magically make a rapper richer.  In other words, haters would say it’s Photoshopped—and haters would probably be right. Bow Wow’s social media stunting quickly gave way to a hashtag, #bowwowchallenge, where Twitter users could share altered photos of their phony lavish lifestyles. But as many #bowwowchallenge truthers were quick to point out, faking it on Instagram isn’t exactly uncommon. Who among us hasn’t Facetuned our selfies on Instagram or inserted Riz Ahmed into our prom pictures?  Of course, these social media crimes are way more embarrassing when they’re committed by celebrities—people we would like to think are actually living the dream, as opposed to just Photoshopping it. The most garden-variety social media fakery is, of course, altering one’s face or body—colloquially referred to as the Facetune. If a star’s Instagram features a strange blur, a confusing reflection or a conspicuously wide thigh gap, it’s most likely the work of a body altering app. Beyoncé, Kylie Jenner (LINK: http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/04/27/inside-kylie-jenner-s-latest-photoshop-controversy.html), Kim Kardashian, and John Mayer have all been accused of getting virtual work done on their social media posts.  But Bow Wow’s Google image gaffe is more reminiscent of the work of two of his fellow rappers: Soulja Boy and 50 Cent. In 2014, Soulja Boy shared multiple pictures and videos of himself surrounded by hundred-dollar bills. The only problem was that the “Crank That” rapper had clearly stuffed his stacks with slips of blank white paper. After fans called Soulja Boy out, he deleted the offensive posts, before responding to the controversy on Twitter. “I just want my fans to know that yes I was on set shooting a video and they had prop money and I took a picture with it. All my cash is real,” he explained. “They had prop money at turn my swag on video 2. They always have props. But I don't want y'all to think I would fool y'all with fake stuff.”  In 2016, 50 Cent upped the prop money ante by exhibiting a pattern of fooling with the aforementioned “fake stuff.” After filing for bankruptcy in Connecticut, Curtis Jackson III was forced to answer for a series of social media posts in which he appeared to be showing off his deep pockets. In response, the rapper’s attorneys claimed that the stacks of money the rapper flexed on Instagram were totally bogus. “The cash depicted in the social media postings is not real,” his lawyers explained. “The postings, which amongst other things, make use of stage or prop money, are part of the Debtor's routine social media marketing activities and relate directly to the Debtor's various business interests. Prop money is routinely us...",

        "text": "Celeb Make Up Artist and Pond's spokesperson, Kayleen McAdams, gave us the scoop on everything from being a successful MUA to the stars, to her beauty essentials!  Q: Where did you get your start as a make up artist?  Kayleen: I'm from Canada so I started working in Toronto. It was a lot of commerical work, working on music videos, that sort of thing. I interned at Flare Magazine where I learned a lot from all sides of the industry. Then I moved to LA and started assisting on projects. I feel like there is no better way to learn that to actually be assisting on a set.  Q: You've worked on a lot of celebrities, how do you decide on a look for clients you are working on?  Kayleen: Sometimes people will have an idea of what they want, but mostly it's collaborative. I take into account the outfit, and I really like to talk to the hairdresser and see how they envision it. You want hair and everything to be cohesive so you take all that into account. Generally people have ideas and things that inspire them, too.  Q: What's your favorite look to create for your sister, Rachel [McAdams]?  Kayleen: She's very creative and likes a lot of different things. I know a lot of people that I work with that have a very specific look, but Rachel always like it to be different which makes it so great. She likes a lot of colors and styles; a heavy lash and nothing on the lips, or a fun lip and simple eye.  Q: What are some of your favorite products to use, such as a primer, sunscreen, lipgloss?  Kayleen: Primer - I really like Dior Skinflash for a primer, and Armani Foundation. For a lighter look, I like Jouer Luminizing Moisture Tint.  Sunscreen - For sunscreen I like Peter Thomas Roth, which is especially good for shoots. You can add it on top and it's easy to put on.  Mascara -Clinique Lash Power Mascara. It has the teeny tiniest little brush and I really like it for getting at the roots of the lashes. Then I can put heavier mascara at the ends. It deposits a lot of color close to the root of the lashes.  Lipgloss - I love Lancome. They make one called Simmer in their Juicy Tubes. It's kind of a great everyday color, peachy with a little bit of gold. I also really loves Nars Lip Gloss in Sandpiper.  Cleanser- I'm a big wipe person when it comes removing makeup. I really like Pond's Morning Refresh Wet Cleansing Towelettes. You can use them to take your makeup off at night and prep your face in the morning and they really get in their and get a lot of stuff off.  Q: Do you have a favorite look for the summer?  Kayleen: I really love a good raspberry lip. I'll kind of do a sheer version. I think it really warms up the skin and because it's so hot, it's an easy way to bring out color without feeling heavy. Another look I like is colored eyeliner. I think a whole shadow can be really heavy. It's easy and quick to use a bright blue or purple and line your eyes and add a few coats of mascara. It's fun and you can wear it during the day.  Q: How about getting a healthy glow without tanning?  Kayleen: I'm an embrace your paleness kind of person, but sometimes I'll put on a little powder bronzer. What I think is key is less what you use and more how you use it. You want to make sure you take care of your skin, makeup off at night, exfoliate and moisturize so you have a healthy canvas. When you put bronzer on you don't want to look like you're wearing it. I'll put it along the cheekbones, forehead and hairline, not all over the face. And if you use a little highlighter over the bronzer, even though its the opposite in color, it brings it out so you look glowy and sun-kissed.  Related: The SPF diet can protect your skin from sun damage  Q: Any final advice for aspiring MUA's?  Kayleen: Get into contact with agencies or other make up artists that you like. Start working at a counter of a line that you're really into and just get in their to get your hands dirty. I think generally other artists want to teach and are collaborative, not competitive. It's a great way to learn techniques and on-set etiquette. That's very good to learn.  Related: Are you happy at your job? Discover your dreams!",

        "text": "Meghan Markle will soon become an official member of the royal family when she exchanges vows with Prince Harry.  Living a real-life fairytale, Ms Markle will leave her American roots and career behind and join her new husband in London.  But as the upcoming royal wedding becomes an increasingly popular topic of conversation, many are wondering who exactly will be footing the bill, how much money the actress has - and who pays for her expansive wardrobe.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  As it turns out, the former actress and philanthropist is much more than just a future royal - and she has a pretty impressive net worth in her own right.  Here’s everything you need to know about Meghan Markle’s age, future royal status, net worth and family.  What is her age?  Surprisingly, Meghan Markle is actually three years older than her future prince - and her real name is Rachel Meghan Markle.  Ms Markle was born on August 4 1981 in Los Angeles, California. She is currently 36 years old.  What is her net worth?  Before finding her prince charming, Markle was successful in her own right.  Although much less than her fiancé’s, it is estimated that she has a net worth of £3.5m ($5m).  She has worked numerous jobs, including as a calligrapher before becoming a successful actress in Hollywood.  Prior to making it big, Markle had multiple small guest roles on television, including spots on General Hospital, Century City, The War at Home, and CSI: NY.  In 2011, Markle’s big acting break came when she was cast as Rachel Zane on the show Suits, which she played for seven seasons, until finishing in late 2017.  For her role on Suits, Fortune magazine estimated she was paid £35,500 ($50,000) per episode or an annual income of £319,400 ($450,000).  Markle also worked as the editor-in-chief of lifestyle website, The Tig, and created a line of women’s workwear alongside Canadian clothing company Reitmans. From these ventures and related sponsorships, Markle received an estimated annual income of £56,800 ($80,000).  And in 2010, Markle was paid £132,750 ($187,000) for her role in the film Remember Me and £121,697 ($171,429) for her role in the short film The Candidate.  As for the future royal’s clothes, she currently pays for her own wardrobe, according to People magazine.  But once she ties the knot, Markle’s clothing budget for official outings will be covered by the money Prince Charles gives to Prince William, Kate Middleton, and Prince Harry from his Duchy of Cornwall income.  Who is her family?  Although Ms Markle wasn’t raised a royal, her early life was certainly not without its perks.  Her mother, Doria Loyce Ragland, is a social worker and a yoga instructor who lives in California. And her father, Thomas Markle Sr, is an Emmy award-winning lighting director who lives in Mexico.  Markle’s parents divorced when she was six years old and although she was their only child, she has two older paternal half-siblings.  She was educated in private schools and attended Northwestern University in theatre and international studies in 2003.  Her mother is African American and her father is Caucasian, a background that Markle has embraced and discussed throughout her career.  In addition to a successful career, Markle’s father Tom, 72, once won the lottery, winning an estimated £532,222 ($750,000), according to the Daily Mail.  Both her parents are expected to attend her wedding on May 19 at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle.  This article has been updated. It was originally published in April 2018.",

In an interview with CNN's Van Jones, an emotional Jay-Z revealed how it almost \"blew up\" due to his lies.  Jones asked Jay-Z about his marriage and why it was so special to be worth fighting for.  \"That's my soulmate. It's the person I love. If you have and experienced love and if you don't understand it or have the tools to move forward, then you're going to have complications,\" said Jay-Z.  Jay-Z, who shares three children -- two girls and a boy -- with his Beyonce, said fighting for his marriage meant breaking the cycle of the past.  \"You can either address it or pretend until it blows up at some point. For us, we chose to fight for our love, for our family to give our kids a different outcome to break that cycle for black men and women,\" he added.  Jay-Z's extramarital affairs came into light after Beyonce's autobiographical album 'Lemonade' dropped in 2016, and contained many of her intimate thoughts and feelings towards her cheating husband.  Jones also asked Jay-Z about US President Donald Trump's recent comments about the African countries, to which Jay-Z said the remarks were \"hurtful\".  \"Everyone feels anger but after the anger it's really hurtful because he's looking down on a whole population of people and he's so misinformed because these places have beautiful people,\" he said.  \"But on the other side, this has been going on. This is how people on, this has been going on behind closed doors,\" he added. RB RB",

        "text": "— Daily Mirror    -Daily Mirror  Battling dodgy, dry and lacklustre skin? Change of season and weather can often result in a change of how your skin behaves. If you have sensitive skin, it can become more unbalanced leaving it blotchy and prone to blemishes. This is a great time to listen to the changing needs of your skin and update your skincare regime.There’s no better way to rid your face of dead skin than to exfoliate it well. Carrying out an extra deep treatment to spring clean your face will instantly improve texture and reveal a brighter, fresher complexion. Here’s how: Apply a creamy exfoliant generously to dry skin after cleansing and leave to dry for five minutes. Support the side of your face with one hand to stop skin from pulling and with long sweeping movements across your face, use your other hand to ‘flake away’ the cream. (It’s a good idea to put your face over the bathroom sink as the product will flake away, removing the build-up of old, dull cells with it). Remove excess by rinsing with warm water. Follow up with a serum or certified organic facial oil and moisturiser.Use a concentrated treatment product in your beauty regime to revitalise skin and boost radiance. Think of it as a shot of vitamins, antioxidants and nourishment all in one. It will help smooth fine lines and wrinkles and give your complexion a massive boost. Use it twice daily for four weeks and you’ll notice the transformation of your skin.Multi-tasking beauty products have to be the best spring beauty hack of them all. A multi-purpose balm is great for keeping lips moisturised and healthy. You can use a liberal amount on nails and cuticles for a subtle shine and buffed look and it does a brilliant job of grooming eyebrows — it helps them grow better and healthier too! A great balm will also act as a brilliant emergency hair product as well, helping to tame frizz and create definition and texture in the ends.If your skin gets a bit unpredictable between seasons, prone to sensitivity or spring-time allergies, a serum which helps strengthen the skin’s natural barrier function is the way to go. Use a serum that calms inflammation, soothes sensitivity and delivers gentle hydration.Antioxidants are important to help combat environmental damage caused by the harsh summer season. Experts believe as much as 80 per cent of skin ageing is caused by free radical damage, sources of which include pollution, sun exposure, diet and stress. It’s easier to prevent the signs of ageing than to cure them. Use products that protect the skin by binding with free radicals, preventing them from attaching to healthy skin cells in a process termed quenching.",

Meghan Markle, 36, is extremely despondent over her half-sister Samantha‘s plans to write a “tell-all” book about the soon-to-be princess, according to a source inside the palace who gave us the EXCLUSIVE deets. “Meghan and Harry will not be responding to Samantha’s comments, as they have no intention of adding fuel to the fire, or giving her anymore publicity,” our source said. “Meghan is really sad that her half-sister is trying to cash in on her relationship with Harry, but she realizes that it was fairly inevitable. Samantha has been telling people that her upcoming memoir is going to contain ‘explosive’ information about Meghan, that will ‘shock’ the royal family to the core — which is utter nonsense.”  Our palace insider went on to say that Samantha has no secrets about Meghan — because Meghan has absolutely nothing to hide. “There are no secrets about Meghan that can be revealed,” our source added. “She’s been completely transparent about her past and has no skeletons in the closet, so unless Samantha intends to make things up, her book is going to make for pretty dull reading.” Well, it would seem the bad blood between Meghan and her family goes both ways. We reported earlier how Meghan’s father Thomas Markle Sr., 73, was apparently “extremely hurt” by Prince Harry‘s remarks that the royals will become the family Meghan never had.  In addition to her plans to write a book about Meghan, Samantha recently slammed Harry for his remarks about her family. While you wonder if Samantha and Thomas will be invited to the wedding, click here to see pics of celebs, including Meghan and Harry, who had the cutest engagements of 2017.  HollywoodLifers, do you think Meghan and her half-sister will reconcile in 2018? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below.",

        "text": "When Kenya Moore and Kim Zolciak-Biermann came face-to-face with each other at Shereé Whitfield's housewarming party, The Real Housewives of Atlanta pal didn't just throw shade at the Don't Be Tardy mom — she also threw shade at her husband, Kroy Biermann. And, Kim says \"that’s where Kenya made a f***ing big mistake.\" The Daily Dish spoke to Kim about the epic face-off, and she shared what exactly went down that led to the women arguing at the Chateau Shereé unveiling.  \"That’s one thing you don’t do is come for my husband or children — two of which she wished she had. Kroy doesn’t really get as heated to respond in the manner that I do. I’m pretty fiery. For him, he wasn’t really actually around me at that time when Kenya started popping off at me at the mouth. We prefer to have a lot less drama in our lives,\" Kim said. \"We’re pretty easy moving. It was definitely good to get out of the house and see some of them. I just need to make sure that Kenya stays in her lane. I don’t know why she feels the need to talk s***.\"  Wondering what caused the argument? Well, Kim took us inside the moments that led to the confrontation.  \"I was in Shereé’s room. She was kind of giving me a tour, or what have you. I was in her room, and we were kind of sitting on her bed, catching up. Somebody came to her door and was like, 'There’s somebody walking around in your basement. I don’t know who it is!' Shereé is kind of like, 'Who is it?' And she opened the door and, of course, it was Kenya,\" she recalled. \"I was like, 'Kenya, that’s rude.' I had only met her one other time in my life. But I said, 'That’s kind of rude. This is Shereé’s house and you know damn well that the party’s not in the f***ing basement.' She was just like, 'Shereé, I have that light. Sheree, I have that headboard too.' I haven’t really followed Housewives to know that she was building her house as well.\"  That's when it turned personal for Kenya and Kim. \"She just started popping off at the mouth like, 'You probably have to worry more about Kroy not working,' and all that s*** started. I was like, 'No, you did not. My husband made more money than you’ll ever make in your life so, goodbye.' Looking like a f***ing train wreck. It’s gross, it’s gross. To me, it’s so f***ing gross,\" Kim said. \"She called me octomom. Like really, bitch? Octomom. That’s very disrespectful. I have 6 children, and you wish that you had my life. That’s the bottom line. She wishes that she had my life and she doesn’t. So she can be miserable.\"  However, Kim — having spent nearly five seasons on RHOA — had an intuition that things could get heated and tense. \"I’m not dumb. I knew that there was a possibility that there may be a little crazy. I figured, 'No, who doesn’t grow in 5 years?' Marlo and I, the last time I saw her, we were in an argument in the reunion and we got along great. It was so great to see her. People grow. I don’t know how the hell this woman hasn’t. After 38 years, it’s time to grow up. I figured by now, people kind of grow up,\" she said. \"On one hand, I did know there was a possibility of something, but I didn’t know and haven’t been around these ladies in 5 years, so what could they be possibly popping off at the mouth at? Obviously Kenya follows me to know that Kroy decided not to play football this season. So I have no idea what the f*** she’s doing. I don’t know what any of them are doing.\"  So, would Kim have anything to say to Kenya should they cross paths again in the future? \"I just wouldn’t even talk to her. I seriously wouldn’t even waste my breath. I feel like she’s just a dark cloud, walking around. Just very unhappy. For someone to come at you talking about your children, your husband. You haven’t seen me in so long. I was sticking up for, of course, my friend Shereé. I always will. I just feel like she’s a dark cloud,\" the mom of six said. \"I don’t even need to waste my breath on her, and apparently a lot of other people feel the same way, according to my Instagram. I’m such an asshole. I’ve never seen such positive feedback with my Twitter and Instagram social media comments, etc that I did. I don’t know with Kenya, if she just pisses of the ladies on the show or what. I’m ready.\"  Still, Kim isn't set on making any more cameos on RHOA in the near future. \"I love filming Don’t Be Tardy. I love filming with my family. It’s a lot of fun. I’m motivated by money. I’d be lying if I didn’t tell you that. We’ll see. It was definitely, like I said, good to see some of the ladies. I definitely enjoyed reconnecting with them and it was good to get out of the house,\" she said. \"Who knows what the future will hold? But I do enjoy filming Don’t Be Tardy, for sure.\"  Stay tuned for more fireworks when the RHOA finale kicks off Sunday, April 16 at 8/7c. Preview, below.",

The sun sets on Wilshire Boulevard and the glimmer of lights that’s coming through the Neiman Marcus windows matches the twinkling bulbs wrapped around the towering palms outside. Inside, well-dressed patrons shuffle through racks, stroll the tree-adorned halls, slip on hats and gloves and enjoy their last sips of rosé at the Bar on 4 before ringing an Uber and bringing their goodies home.  It’s easy to get sucked in. The vibe at Neiman’s is intoxicating, especially during the holiday season. On the first floor, Erika Girardi—better known as dazzling pop icon, alter-ego Erika Jayne—is eyeballing every glittering heel on the Balenciaga display and reminiscing about her life before the spotlight. She recalls her first big Neiman’s purchase, a carefully-chosen pair of Gucci shoes. “They were black platforms,” she says. “I knew they would go with everything.”  Girardi has come along way from that moment. Her shopping style now? She lets out a wild laugh: “Jeez, I run through here like a maniac! I know what I want, I know my sizes and I rarely return things. To be able to shop in a place like this is pure luxury.” She picks up a pair of sparkling, lightning-bolt adorned Balmain ankle boots and grins.  Watch the video above to see if Girardi is able to control herself when she has Neiman Marcus Beverly Hills all to herself on one very unforgettable night.",

        "text": "Given the amount of A-listers packed into one venue, it's no surprise the amount of drama that goes down at the annual star-studded Met Gala.  Unfortunately, this year's soiree -- which was supposed to take place on Monday with the theme, About Time: Fashion and Duration, and was set to be co-chaired by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour as well as designer Nicolas Ghesquière of Louis Vuitton, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Emma Stone and Meryl Streep -- has been postponed indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute has been keeping spirits alive, announcing the #MetGalaChallenge on Friday, which invites people to recreate famous past Met Gala red carpet looks from home.  But aside from the unforgettable fashion, the Met Gala has also been the scene of some of the biggest headline-making moments in pop culture. From Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston's dance-off that marked the start of their whirlwind romance, to Solange and JAY-Z's elevator fight caught on tape, let's take a look back at the 13 most jaw-dropping moments.  Alex Rodriguez claims Kylie Jenner talked about how rich she is:  Rodriguez talked about his experience alongside Jennifer Lopez at the 2019 Met Gala in an interview with Sports Illustrated, and made a shocking comment about Jenner.  \"We had a great table,\" he said. \"The black guy from The Wire -- Idris Elba, yeah, and his new wife. Some famous singer next to me, I don’t know what her name is. Versace -- Donatella. We had Kylie and Kendall [Jenner]. And we had an Asian gentleman from Rich Asians, the lead.\"  \"Kylie was talking about Instagram and her lipstick, and how rich she is,\" he added.  Jenner later refuted his comments, tweeting, \"Umm, no i didn't. We only spoke about Game of Thrones ??‍♀️??‍♀️\"  Rodriguez then agreed, tweeting, \"OMG that’s right @KylieJenner!! It was me talking about you and your makeup line and how much my girls love you. #GOT #respect #alllove,\" he wrote.  Jared Leto poses with a replica of his own head:  Leto definitely pushed the envelope when he carried a replica of his own head at the 2019 Met Gala.  The outfit was reminiscent of Gucci’s Fall/Winter 2018 line, which featured models walking the runway with decapitated heads resembling themselves.  The legend jumped out #MetGalapic.twitter.com/35VtLX5dAu — Mi vida mi amor (@Osqui_x) May 6, 2019  Mindy Kaling recently recreated Leto's unforgettable look as part of the #MetGalaChallenge and the results are spectacular.  Kim Kardashian West's infamous pregnant 2013 Met Gala debut:  Kardashian West definitely made a statement at her first-ever Met Gala in 2013, with an unforgettable skintight floral dress designed by Riccardo Tisci. The reality star was pregnant with daughter North at the time, and made sure her baby bump was on full display.  Getty Images  The dress sparked plenty of memes, a few comparing Kardashian West's bold look to a couch.  In 2015 she poked fun at the gown, dressing up as herself for Halloween, this time pregnant with her son, Saint.  \"Still fits,\" she cracked.  Kardashian West's Met Gala debut also sparked some controversy when Vogue did not include the reality star in a photo gallery of the best-dressed stars from the event. Kim's husband, Kanye West, made the cut, but Kardashian West was Photoshopped out of the original photo.  Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston have a flirty dance-off:  In hindsight, Swift and Hiddleston's chemistry was pretty obvious.  Prior to the two's whirlwind romance in 2016, Valentino brand ambassador Carlos Souza shared video of Swift and Hiddleston dancing at the Met Gala to rapper T.I.'s 2004 hit, \"Bring Em Out.\"  The duo also showed off their moves to Beyoncé's \"Crazy in Love,\" with Hiddleston eagerly twirling Swift around.  Hiddleston later talked to the Press Association about the viral moment.  \"I love dancing, who doesn't?\" he said. \"It's a weird one. I haven't actually danced for a long time, but I happened to be dancing at the Met Gala, because it was a party.\"  \"I was on a table with Taylor Swift and The Weeknd was playing and she said, 'The thing about these parties is nobody gets up to dance,'\" he continued. \"She, as a musician, was like, 'We've got to dance for The Weeknd!' so we got up and danced.\"  Swift and Hiddleston ended up dating for three months before splitting in September 2016.

She then brought Saint into the world the year after her wedding, and little Chicago was born via surrogacy in January of this year.  Kim's own mother is the legendary family 'momager' Kris Jenner, and her father is the late O.J. Simpson lawyer Robert Kardashian.

Kylie became a mother at 20 this year when she gave birth to her daughter Stormi in February, and Kim has interviewed Kylie on the subject for ES magazine.  'What is the most surprising thing about being a mom, and how has your perspective changed on beauty and business since becoming a mom?' Kim asked.  Family history: Kim gave birth to North the year before she and Kanye held a sumptuous wedding in Florence, making him her third husband  Kylie replied: 'I think more about the future because of her. Every time I leave and I’m stressed about leaving her, I’m like: \"I’m doing it for you.\"'  The lip kit icon shared: 'Everyone says you change completely when you become a mom, but I really feel the same, just better. So I don’t know what really has completely changed my world, besides her, of course.'  Said Kylie: 'But I feel like it’s only gotten better. You’re less selfish - and I actually enjoy changing diapers. It’s really satisfying. To make her clean again. And I don’t know, the whole thing is really…it’s like such an amazing experience.'

A source close to the actor told In Touch, 'Brad's finally got the kids, and he's overjoyed.  'To Brad's delight, Angelina has decided to let the majority of the children, who have summer camps and a slew of other activities in the works, stay in LA with their father while she's in Britain filming Maleficent 2.'  Brad was reportedly livid when Angelina told him she'd found a home in London to live in with all six children while she filmed the Disney sequel, 'but to keep him from fighting her on it,' a friend tells, 'she promised Brad that he could spend longer periods with their children.'  In Touch's report claims that's what their children want too.  RELATED:  The 54-year-old actor, 'couldn't be happier' according to In Touch, because now he knows he'll have his quality time with all six children.  In Touch's report further reveals Brad's already preparing his LA home.  'He gets such enjoyment out of seeing them cut loose at their amusement park-like former home,' the friend tells the publication. 'So, he's really spruced up the pool area, the skateboard ramp and the bike track.'  Spending time with his kids over the summer could give the actor the leverage he needs to get joint custody once and for all.  'He's been patient long enough,' says the friend. 'Something's got to give. Angelina can't control everything forever.'  Neither Brad or Angelina have responded to In Touch's report.",

That might seem somewhat innocent, but if you think about their backstory, it could be a very big clue.  Moretz and Beckham first sparked interest when they were linked together back in 2016. However, the relationship didn’t last too long — they broke up, and Beckham had a few interviews where he mentioned he was single. But even if they’re nothing but friends these days, it seems like they parted on excellent terms.  But, let’s get real here. While they haven’t openly admitted it, we’re under the impression that it’s more than friendship. The most important thing is that they seem to be incredibly happy.  Rumors sparked that the two had reunited back in August, when they were both spotted out together in New York City.  Just a few days ago, Beckham posted a sweet photo of their matching checkered Vans on Instagram, which is simply sweet.  The video of the kiss looks like it happened in Dublin. Both Beckham and Moretz were in town to check out a rugby match, and Beckham posted this photo celebrating the occasion on Instagram.  While it looks like Moretz took the photo in question, Beckham’s account has a ton of gorgeously shot photos, many which include both of them. It could be because he’s a photographer who just recently released his very first book called What I See.",

Even worse, she fears that she will somehow be blamed for his bad luck this season.  “Kendall [Jenner] feels horrible about Blake [Griffin]‘s injury. Kendall fears she will somehow be blamed for his bad luck. She has heard about the Kardashian curse for years and thinks it is just ridiculous. She also understands how dedicated fans may look for anyway to make sense of a bad situation. But in the end, Kendall feels like any accusations towards her are simply unfair, misguided anger. Kendall loves watching Blake play and she knows how important basketball is in his life, so she is going to do everything she can to care, support and help him get back to his teammates ASAP,” a source close to Kendall tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  At this time, it’s not clear how Blake’s injury (which occurred during a game on Nov. 28) will affect the rest of his basketball season, but sources told ESPN that he could be out for two months! And that wouldn’t be good for the Los Angeles Clippers, who have already endured a 9-game losing streak. Obviously, these things happen, but Kendall is afraid fans will blame her for Blake’s recent bad luck. As we EXCLUSIVELY learned, fans are already blaming Kendall for the team’s horrible season. “The Clippers are playing terrible and have lost nine in a row and the blame is going all around to every player in the organization,” a source close to the team EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. “Some of the teammates of Blake who are superstitious to it all believe that the Kardashian Curse is a real thing and has something to do with their woes even though Blake is laughing all that off and isn’t taking that as the reason for their losing streak and bad play. It hasn’t started a riff between teammates yet but the talk in the locker room has involved Kendall so it should be interesting moving forward how people continue to react to it all.”  We don’t think the “Kardashian curse” is real, but we can see why Kendall’s now afraid fans will also blame her for Blake’s injury. Hopefully, she ignores the haters and just focuses on helping Blake return to the court as soon as possible!  HollywoodLifers, is the “Kardashian cure” to blame for Blake’s injury? Tell us how you feel, below!",

The Shimmer and Sparkle Cocktail Party Trivia Game, which is advertised on supermarket Tesco's website, could have upset the Royal family with this embarrassing gaffe.  Whoever made the game seemingly doesn't know the difference between Prince William and his younger brother Harry. Whoops!  It gave a group of friends settling down for a round of Christmas trivia a good laugh though.  (Image: WENN.com)  The question reads: \"Prince Harry and Kate Middleton welcomed their second child in 2015, a girl named?\"  It gives the answer as \"Charlotte\", which would be right, if Harry were her father.  Of course it's Kate's husband and Harry's big brother, Prince William, who welcomed his baby girl into the world last year.  The trivia fan who found the mistake said: \"It was just so random, I couldn't believe it when I saw it. It really made me laugh.\"  (Image: Ian Vogler/Daily Mirror)  Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now  And as we all know, Harry is dating Suits actress Meghan Markle .  The 32-year-old prince spent a traditional Christmas Day at the Royals’ Sandringham, before sources say he jetted off to Canada to be with Meghan, 35.  A source said: “Harry is desperate to be with her as soon as possible.  “Normally he’d be with the rest of the family, but seeing as William is at the Middletons’ for Christmas it looks like he’s being allowed to break with tradition.”  The trivia game, which is made in China, is listed on Tesco 's website, although it is not currently for sale.  The supermarket's website states that the game includes 90 question and answer cards, but makes yet another mistake when it gives examples of some of the questions, asking which \"US sitcome\" Zooey Deschanel stars in.  (Image: REUTERS)  (Image: WireImage)  Harry and Meghan spent Christmas apart following a romantic week in London, during which they made a low-key appearance in the middle of one of the capital's busiest areas.  The two were spotted having a private joke as they strolled through Piccadilly Circus and up Shaftesbury Avenue towards the Gielgud Theatre, where the prince had bought them last-minute tickets to The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time - not the comedy play Peter Pan Goes Wrong, as was first thought.  Onlookers were shocked to see the couple, wearing winter coats and woolly hats, walking the streets, accompanied by just one protection officer.  Mirror Celeb has contacted Tesco for comment.",

The 34-year-old actress allegedly confessed the illicit affair to Marcheline Bertrand, causing irreparable damage to their relationship.  'Marcheline had a live-in boyfriend whom she was very much in love with, but Angie slept with him when she was 16 and barely out of school,' a source told Now magazine.  'Her mother found out and ended her relationship with the man.'  Shock claims: Angelina Jolie, pictured in Hollywood last night with partner Brad Pitt, allegedly slept with her mother's boyfriend as a teenager    Brushing off the scandal: Angelina made a sharp exit after dinner with her partner    Angelina was said to be devastated when her mother died of cancer, in 2007, at the age of 56.  The star is no stranger to scandal - she famously French-kissed her brother James Haven at the Oscars in 2000 and once sealed her love for former husband Billy Bob Thornton with a vial of blood.  'Damaged relationship': Angelina with her mother Marcheline Bertrand in 2001  She has since reinvented herself as a UN Goodwill Ambassador and a mother to three adopted children Maddox, 7, Pax, 5, Zahara, 4, and biological daughter, Shiloh, 3, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 15 months.    Morton, who has also written controversial unauthorised biographies on Tom Cruise and the late Princess Diana, is expected to release the book later this year.  He says: 'AJ is one of the most fascinating women on the planet. Hers has been an extraordinary journey and an extraordinary story. I'm looking forward to telling it.  Angelina, who last night dined at Hollywood Cicconi's restaurant with partner Brad Pitt, has not yet commented on the allegations.  A separate book, titled Brangelina Exposed, is also set to lift the lid on her relationship with Pitt.    It promises to explain how the famous couple 'have successfully manipulated the public into believing a glamorous fairytale that bears little resemblance to the reality of the pair's life together.'  Author Ian Halperin claims to reveal 'new details of her volatile relationship with and estrangement from her father Jon Voight, her struggles with suicidal impulses, her heroin use, her sexual exploits and her remarkable rise to become an Oscar-winning actress.'  Brangelina Exposed is due for release on December 1.",

Rumors of a romance between the two have been going on for a couple of months, and while neither star has confirmed nor denied the claims, they've both been conveniently at the same place at the same time lately. On Tuesday, just one night after both attending the Louis Vuitton 2019 Cruise runway show, Justin and Emma were spotted enjoying each other's company while relaxing on the patio of a house in the small village of Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France. The Oscar-winning actress showed skin in a red one-piece and pants, while Justin showed off his washboard abs by going shirtless. While the could-be couple didn't show any PDA, their closeness and comfort with each other is pretty clear.  Justin has been linked to Emma since early March, after it was announced that he was separating from his wife of two years, Jennifer Aniston, and \"pursuing\" the La La Land actress. Emma and Justin are starring together in the upcoming Netflix dark comedy series Maniac, and Justin seemed to squash the dating rumors with a photo of them that he captioned \"Bffffffs. And yes. JUST bfffffs.\" Justin and Emma also appeared to leave a Met Gala afterparty together in May, adding more fuel to dating reports. Justin has also been recently linked to Aubrey Plaza, Olivia Munn, model Erika Cardenas, and — most recently — Spider-Man: Homecoming actress Laura Harrier, whom he was spotted swimming with earlier this week.

The latest news is that their birth certificates show that their mother, Beyoncé, shares the same obstetrician/gynaecologist as none other than Kim Kardashian.  Yes, according to TMZ, Kim and Queen B had their babies delivered by Dr Paul Crane.  It seems that Dr Crane is familiar with the Kardashian family and their brood also delivering Kourtney Kardashian's and Scott Disick's children and Dream, daughter of Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian.  Reports say that the twins were born at 5:13 am with Rumi arriving first and Sir following soon after.  Sir Carter and Rumi 1 month today. ??❤️?????????? A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Jul 13, 2017 at 10:10pm PDT  Although it's been rumoured previously that Kim and Beyoncé aren't the best of pals, perhaps that's all rubbish and Kim actually provided Bey with the recommendation.  The 'divide' between the pair is said to date back to when the Carters reportedly didn't attend Kimye's wedding and although Kim is thought to have tried to arrange playdates for Blue Ivy and North, it just hasn't happened...  Maybe the shared doctor is just a complete coincidence but interesting nonetheless!  Main image via Instagram: Beyoncé",

Country music festival: On Saturday, Audrina Patridge and Ryan Cabrera fueled dating rumors when they were spotted attending Stagecoach in Palm Springs together  Southern belle: The 32-year-old actress was definitely in the honky-tonk spirit as she posed denim clad in front of an old Chevy pickup truck  Just yesterday, PEOPLE reported that Patridge and Cabrera had officially reunited.  'They're dating,' a source told the magazine. 'They've been spending a lot of time together recently and are having a good time.'  And that seems to be true as the two were seen cuddled up in lawn chairs at the country music festival.  Together again: Audrina and Ryan were seen cuddled up in lawn chairs at the country music festival after PEOPLE reported on Friday that they were once again 'dating'  Strike! Patridge watched as Cabrera bowled in the middle of a field  Since splitting from Cabrera eight years ago, the 32-year-old reality star has gotten married, divorced, and become a mom.  Audrina called it quits with her ex-husband and BMX rider Corey Bohan in September 2017 after saying 'I do,' less than a year earlier.  She currently has full custody of their daughter Kirra Max, 22 months, and is fighting for Bohan's visitation rights to be stripped.  Back on!

The two broke it off due to Patridge's own doubts.  'You're going to be going on tour…that's one of my concerns…the girls and drinking and, you know, drinking too much and them taking advantage,' she said to Cabrera on camera in 2010.  Audrina added: 'Maybe this is too much too soon. Maybe we rushed into this, and now it's just like at a dead end.'  Family issues: Patridge currently has full custody of their daughter Kirra Max, 22 months, and is fighting for Bohan's visitation rights to be stripped  Audrina's stylist Joey Tierney is the one who revealed the couple's reconciliation.

Even though Kate Middleton isn't traveling with him, the Duchess is clearly on William's mind.  Today, the Duke visited Jerash, an archaeological site and one of Jordan's most popular tourists spots. While touring the site, William stopped to pay tribute to Kate by recreating a sweet childhood photo taken when the Duchess was four years old. William posed at the same exact spot seen here in this Middleton family photo:  In the Middleton family photo taken at the historic site, a young Kate smiles with Michael Middleton and her sister, Pippa. The Middletons lived in Amman, Jordan in May 1984 through September 1986 after relocating due to Michael's job with British Airways. This sweet snap was released by the Middleton family and the Palace just before Will and Kate's royal wedding in 2011.

Amidst rumors that the actress is marrying a British businessman, she’s put permanent roots down in California by purchasing the massive Cecil B. DeMille estate — check out pics of the lavish mansion here.  Angelina Jolie, 41, has a new home in Los Angeles…and it’s stunning. It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids. Perhaps staying in Los Angeles is her way of making sure Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox continue to have a relationship with their father? Either way, the house is insane — check it out in the gallery above.  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Angelina’s new house? Do you think she’s prepping for a wedding?",

Schumer and Hanisch are splitting after a year and a half of dating, the actress' rep confirmed on Tuesday in statements to US Weekly and E! News.  “Amy and Ben have ended their relationship after thoughtful consideration and remain friends,” Schumer’s rep said.  From the looks of her Instagram, Schumer is keeping busy in the aftermath of her breakup: participating in table reads, singing karaoke and making press appearances with her Snatched on-screen mom, Goldie Hawn.  Schumer and Hanisch made frequent appearances together on red carpets and ballpark kiss cams, celebrating their one-year anniversary in November with dueling Instagram posts.    \"A year ago I met the love of my life,\" Hanisch captioned a black-and-white picture. \"We both weren't looking for a relationship at the time, but something felt right from the very first night we met. We ended up spending 6 days in a row together. This pic was taken in New Orleans and was the night I knew I wanted to spend my life with her.\"    Meanwhile, Schumer opted for a more humorous approach. \"A year ago today I met the love of my life.

        "text": "A refresher on one of the most iconic R&B groups in American music...  Quite a bit of time has passed since you've last seen Kandi, Tiny, LaTocha, and Tamika all together as Xscape, but they're back and better than ever. Their show, Xscape Still Kickin' It, premieres this Sunday, and we thought you just might need a refresher on one of the most iconic R&B groups in American music. After all, it has been almost 20 years. Here's everything that you need to know about Xscape.    Xscape Has 4 Members  Like many other R&B groups of their time, Xscape has added and dropped a few members over the years. Today, the group is made up of 4 members: LaTocha Scott, Tamika Scott, Tameka \"Tiny\" Harris, and Kandi Burruss.  Thanks to Everyone for all of the beautiful birthday wishes💋🎉🎉#birthdaygirl #thankful A post shared by LaTocha (@iamlatocha) on Oct 2, 2017 at 9:49am PDT  LaTocha sings mezzo-soprano  Tamika also sings mezzo-soprano  That Girl👑💰💁🏼 Xscape tho..🙌🏽 my glam slays @latashawright & @bkluvsme A post shared by Majorgirl (@majorgirl) on May 8, 2017 at 12:33pm PDT  Tiny provides the soprano sound  Ready to hit the town to celebrate my #Essence cover! Thanks @sewjodie & @erika_lapearl_mua for getting me right for tonight! @houseofcb dress picked out by #NoIGJeremy A post shared by Kandi Burruss (@kandi) on Sep 22, 2017 at 6:16pm PDT  Kandi rounds out the group with her contralto  They Were Super Successful in the '90s  If you were listening to music in the 1990s, it was likely that you were listening to an Xscape song at some point. People loved Xscape's unique sound and aesthetic because it was different from the typical R&B of the decade. From their debut single \"Just Kickin' It\" to the sexy sneakin' track \"My Little Secret,\" Xscape gave us hit after hit, each song diffferent from the others. The group released three albums during its run, and each of those albums went platinum. Xscape also had six top 10 hit songs on the Billboard Hot 100. So yeah--they're kind of a big deal.  Drama Split Them Apart...  The price of fame proved to be too costly for the group, and tensions began to rise between the women at the height of their career. After their third album, the members of Xscape went their seperate ways, citing many different reasons and rumors including pregnancy, solo aspirations, and perhaps a romantic relationship with the label head of So So Def Recordings, Jermaine Dupri (scandalous!). The last time they would record together would be 1998.  Following the split, the members decided to pursue solo careers. LaTocha and Tameka continued to sing together as Xscape while doing their own thing, LaTocha was cast in the second season of TVOne's R&B Divas: Atlanta, and Tameka sang on the soundrtracks for classic films like The Mask and Why Did I Get Married? Tiny would go on to co-write (with Kandi!) the Grammy-award winning TLC song \"No Scrubs\" as well as feature on several hip hop songs. She married Atlanta rap legend T.I. in 2010, and the Harris family recently wrapped up the sixth and final season of their reality show T.I. & Tiny: The Family Hustle on VH1. As for Kandi...well, you know. She's written and produced music, owns several of her own businesses, and currently stars on The Real Housewives of Atlanta.  ...But They're Back!  It may have taken them 20 years, but Xscape finally decided to get back together after several of the ladies apologized to each other for what had gone down. And now, they're making sweet harmonies and serving looks together on and offstage.  This pic describes how we felt when we found out our concert SOLD OUT in 1 DAY!!!!! Thanks to everyone in Detroit who bought tickets! We love y'all! Can't wait to hit the stage with #NEXT & #Total. A post shared by Kandi Burruss (@kandi) on May 26, 2017 at 3:32pm PDT  Now that you're all caught up, make sure to tune in for the season premiere of Xscape Still Kickin' It this Sunday November 5 at 9/8c!",

We wish nothing but the best for each other, and ask for your support and understanding at this time.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Nevertheless, the two did their best to overcome their issues together and Bushnell moved to Higgins’ hometown of Denver shortly after going public with their engagement following the season finale, which aired in March.  Of Higgins declaration of love to both women, Bushnell told PEOPLE exclusively at the time that “post-filming was more of an emotional roller coaster than the actual show.”  “I fall more in love with Ben every day and it’s hard to separate what happened long ago and my current feelings,” she said. “It’s confusing. It does wear on me.”  “It hurts,” she added. “It’s like, why did I have to go through that hurt? It’s already a few months of confusion and tears and then to have to deal with it again. It’s hard.”  Higgins, meanwhile, told PEOPLE he couldn’t apologize “for being honest or expressing what I thought was the best thing to express at the time.”  “Don’t get us wrong. Throughout this whole show airing and conversations we’ve had about decisions and life, it hasn’t always been easy,” he continued. “But it’s added a whole new level to our relationship. And [the show ultimately] led me to this woman who I love deeply. She’s the only woman I’ll love from now on.”  FROM PEN: Christina and Tarek El Moussa’s Divorce Has Not Stopped Their Business Relationship  Six months later, Higgins and Bushnell returned to the small screen for one season of their Freeform reality show Ben and Lauren: Happily Ever After?  Ahead of the premiere, the two revealed exclusively to PEOPLE in October that they were undergoing couples counseling at their church: “We’re not the perfect couple,” Higgins said. “Far from it! But we are trying really hard and we love each other a lot.”  “There are so many weird elements to being in a relationship after The Bachelor,” said Bushnell. “We’ve gotten in arguments like any other couple, but about some things that other couples wouldn’t have to fight about, like the fact that we met when he was dating other women. You can say that’s what I signed up for, but it’s still real life and it’s still hard.”  And overcoming trust issues that lingered after the Fletcher drama wasn’t easy, either.  “For a long time, I was really angry for being blindsided,” said Bushnell. “And that resentment and anger affected our relationship much longer than it should have.”  Ultimately, the two always maintained they were “not in any rush” to tie the knot.  “We’re both ready to get married, but we haven’t set a date because we want to make sure we’re not doing it for anyone but ourselves,” said Bushnell.",

Since then he's made some major changes to his diet, workouts, and lifestyle.  Now, he says he embraces carbs, mid-intensity workouts, transcendental meditation, and living in the moment.  It still seems unfathomable that health and fitness expert Bob Harper suffered a near-fatal heart attack last year on February 12, 2017. “It’s been a very challenging year and an eye-opening year,” he told WomansDay.com. “So much has had to change for me personally. Not only have I had to change my diet, I’ve had to change the way that I work out—the way that I live.”    This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  The 52-year-old Biggest Loser trainer recounts the dizzy spells he had been experiencing weeks prior to collapsing at a New York City gym on that fateful day. “What I should have done was seen a doctor immediately,” he says. “I’m a workout nut, so I’m used to being uncomfortable, I’m used to being in pain. So I did something that’s so dumb—I learned how to adjust. It was not smart on my part.”  But what a difference a year makes. Here, the author and television personality shares the five ways he has transformed his health—and his life—from the inside out.  He is embracing carbs.  Harper, who is currently a health contributor on TODAY and a frequent co-host of the Racheal Ray Show, was consuming a high-protein, high-fat diet prior to his heart attack. “I was healthy, I was fit, I was strong, I watched what I ate. But now I realized that what my diet was lacking—maybe I don’t want to say lacking, but how it was different—was that it didn’t have balance,” he explains.  St. Martin's Press  The missing component: Carbohydrates. After all, he was well-aware that cutting out carbs typically results in rapid weight loss. “Yet what I’ve found for longevity, it’s very hard for a lot of people to sustain that type of diet.” Today, his meal plan “leans more on the Mediterranean-style” with a focus on plant-based foods, including more fruits and vegetables, as well as whole-grains. “There are so many great pastas out there, like red lentil, chickpea pasta, and quinoa pasta,” he adds. “I like being able to eat a sandwich and not feel like I’ve committed a cardinal sin!”  And yes, it is possible to shed unwanted pounds—and keep them off—on this regime, which is the premise of his latest book, . “I think the biggest thing people are going to learn from my book is I want to press the reset button,” explains Harper. “I think there have been a lot of very lopsided, extreme diets for the last couple of decades. I want to put balance back onto your plate—and get you to lose weight, if that’s what you’re trying to do—with protein, fats, and carbohydrates so you can not only do this diet, but have it be a way of life. Balance in every aspect of my life—especially now—is super important.”  He has said goodbye to intense workouts.  This longtime CrossFit enthusiast admits that modifying his fitness routine was not an easy adjustment. “I was the guy who was posting these workouts of myself in the gym doing these really crazy things, but I’m not able to do that anymore,” he says. “And it’s okay. I’ve cut myself slack, which is a new thing for me.”  He labels his current workouts as mid-intensity with a longer time domain, “meaning I’m working out a little longer to condition more heart, to keep my heart rate up—that’s what I learned in my cardiac rehab,” continues Harper. “They want me to keep my heart rate up for about 30 to 45 minutes, but not too intense.”  This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  Plus, he’s added other forms of exercise to his lifestyle. “I walk a lot with my dogs [Karl and Vivienne] here in the city [New York City], I’m doing a lot of yoga, and I’ve been wanting to incorporate boxing—that’s my challenge for 2018.” And he’s no longer sweating it out every single day (he averages about five days a week). “I used to be very regimented—I knew how I was going to work out on Monday, I knew what I was going to do every day following. But now it’s a little more relaxed.”  He takes time each day to focus on inner calmness.  A three-time New York Times bestselling author, Harper regularly practices transcendental meditation (TM), which involves silently repeating a mantra in order to place your body in a state of profound rest and allow your mind to achieve a sense of peace, as defined by the Mayo Clinic. “TM, yoga, and my dogs really help me with managing my stress,” he emphasizes. “I tell people you have to find whatever it is in your life that you can do to turn off the white noise, just for a few minutes. If it means sitting with your phone off for five or...",

Kidman was on the show promoting her movie The Beguiled, which she co-stars with Kirsten Dunst, Elle Fanning, and Colin Farrell. In it, she has to give Farrell’s character a sponge bath, which Kidman admitted, “took about a day” to film.  When Norton asked if filming the sponge bath scenes were awkward, she referred to another upcoming movie she co-stars with Farrell, called The Killing Of A Sacred Deer.  “Considering what Colin and I did in ‘The Killing Of A Sacred Deer’, that was nothing,” she told Norton. They play husband and wife that are described as a troubled couple, but their “sex life is good, if a little kinky,” according to Variety.  But, according to E! News, she quickly said, “Can we move on? My husband is on the show!“  We don’t blame her for wanting the change the subject so fast! Norton switched gears by asking Kidman about her upcoming birthday, in which she turns 50! Urban talks about what he has planned and what he did for her 40th in the clip below.  Now On Spotify!

The singer took to Twitter to share that after 18 years of following the rules, she had finally been pulled over for speeding.  Underwood is still in recovery following a nasty fall she had on the steps of her home that resulted in over 40 stitches in her face.  I don't know about you, but I've only ever been pulled over by the cops twice in my life. Both times, it was for dumb things I still had to pay a ticket for. Both times, I might have apologized so profusely I sounded like a broken record and things got weird. I may or may not have cried (I plead the Fifth on that count). So considering my history with the law, I found Carrie Underwood's recent run-in with the cops extremely relatable. Like, painfully so.  On Monday afternoon, Underwood tweeted out to her Twitter followers that it had finally happened: After close to two decades spent as a licensed driver, the fuzz finally got her.  \"Well, it happened today. After 18 years, I can no longer say I’ve never been pulled over for speeding. I feel so ashamed! I may or may not have cried in my car after the cop let me go,\" Underwood wrote, following it up with some pretty silly hashtags: \"#RuleFollower,\" \"#GrannyDriver\" and \"#ImSorry.\"  Does anyone else just wanna hug Underwood, though? Like, I totally feel her pain when it comes to possibly getting all flustered and upset when the cops pull you over. Don't worry, sis. I'm right there with you!  Underwood didn't share the specifics of her traffic stop, like how much she was ticketed or how fast she was going, but this insight into her personal life is a very Carrie Underwood thing to do. She's been sharing a lot with her fans lately, including the fact that she is still in recovery from a mighty nasty fall she had on the steps of her home. The resulting facial injury required stitches, as Underwood revealed in early January 2018 on her Twitter.  So, seeing as Underwood has been put through the worst of the worst lately, I say we all gather up whatever good karma we have lying around and send it to her, OK? It sounds like she needs it.

During an interview with OUT magazine, the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star explained that while she included many happy moments in her book, she didn’t want to get too deep into the hardships and her personal issues.  “I left all the massive hard things out as I believe one should,” she admitted.  According to Erika, 46, she believes everyone should keep certain things to themselves and said she didn’t want to allow her dark moments to bring down the vibe of her publication.  “I don’t think anybody should know anyone’s whole, complete story because its no one’s but your own, whether you’re famous or not, some things are just [for] you,” she said. “The book is playful and meant to be fun and meant to make you smile.”  In other Erika Girardi news, the reality star and pop star, who is also known as Erika Jayne, recently appeared on E!’s The Daily Pop where she opened up about the sex lives of her co-stars.  “They don’t [talk about sex],” she told host Justin Sylvester. “I don’t know why because it’s not that big of a deal. Everybody’s doing it, all the time. I mean, we all got here. It’s funny how conservative [the other ladies appear] when you know they ain’t. Come on, now!”  Although her co-stars may act prudish on the show, Erika suspects Lisa Vanderpump is actually a “closet freak.”  “When I see Lisa’s constant sexual innuendos and jabs, I’m like, what’s really going on?” she joked.  Earlier this year, Lisa spoke to Stassi Schroeder about her bedroom antics and seemingly confirmed Erika’s suspicions.  “There’s nothing I haven’t tried,” Lisa told Stassi on Straight Up With Stassi. “Ken’s a very sexy man. Ken knows what he’s doing. Ken’s got it going on and he’s a very virile man. Very. Like a little too much!”  Photo Credit: Instagram  TELL US – THOUGHT ON ERIKA’S COMMENTS? DID YOU READ HER BOOK?",

Cashmere Cat tapped Cabello for new song “Love Incredible”, which was leaked Wednesday.

The song will reportedly feature on Cashmere Cat’s forthcoming album Wild Love. The DJ has previously worked with Selena Gomez and Tory Lanez on “Trust Nobody”.

ET has an exclusive sneak peek at Monday's episode of The Bachelorette, in which Garrett becomes the first man to get a second one-on-one date, and the guys can't contain their jealousy.  \"I could feel the air go out of all the other guys in the room when my name was called,\" Garrett confesses, as another frontrunner, Blake, starts to question everything.  \"Seeing Garrett get this one-on-one is such a slap in the face. She has to know that this is killing me. She has to!\" Blake says. \"She's obviously way into him. Way into him.\"    \"I thought me and Becca had something special, but maybe I'm just completely out of my mind. Like, maybe there's nothing there,\" he continues. \"I don't know. Maybe I'm just making it all up in my head.\"  See the full clip in the video player above.  While tensions rise among the men, Becca told ET last month that it's her relationships with the guys that made the show so difficult. In fact, when asked which moment she's not looking forward to seeing on TV, she said \"the two final breakups.\"  \"There were so many emotions involved,\" she explained, adding that she's also doing her best to explain her connections with the other guys to her fiance.  \"He knows everything that really went on, and it will be tough to watch back, I'm sure. I remember watching it back last season, and it's not the easiest,\" Becca noted. \"It's still difficult, but he knows I'm an open book, so anything he needs, I'm willing to give him.\"  See more in the video below.

Speaking out for the first time since sharing the news on Facebook, the mom of 13 opens up to PEOPLE in this week’s issue, offering details of 18-year-old Zack’s life and recent struggle with depression in hopes of raising awareness for other family’s at risk.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “He was my wild child; 13 broken bones, umpteen trips to the hospital with appendicitis, tonsillitis, a fractured skull. He was wild but so so so sweet,” the Port Orchard, Washington-based star, 57, recalls of raising son Zack (one of her three biological children, the other 10 were welcomed through adoption).  Image zoom Courtesy of Delilah  And like his mom, Zack, who was a senior in high school, had the gift of compassion. “He was a faithful friend to the outcast and the troubled. Dozens of his friends have written to me and told me he was like a counselor to them,” says Delilah, adding that in the wake of his death, the mom of one of his friends reached out saying “he saved her daughter’s life when she was battling depression and anorexia, insisting the girl tell her folks and going with her to do that.”  His own struggle began recently, following a December 2016 car accident. “The event traumatized him,” she says. A painful breakup and an illness followed suit and soon Zack found himself behind in school.  “When he found out he wouldn’t graduate he spiraled into depression, and was honest about it,” says his mom, who quickly “found him doctors, a fabulous counselor and support group.”  Image zoom Courtesy of Delilah  Just before the end, “He was doing so well,” she says. “He was looking forward to making up his missed credits, graduating and starting film school. He was fascinated with science fiction and time travel and began to talk about the book A Wrinkle in Time and quantum physics.”  While Delilah declines to share the manner of his death, she says Zack left behind a message. “His goodbye note did not mention sadness, anger, angst or depression, just a pressing madness about feeling like this world was not his home.”  “She’s devastated,” says Delilah’s rep. This is yet another round of sadness for the radio star, who after struggles with her own parents and three failed marriages, wed business owner Paul Warner in 2012. That same year she lost 16-year-old son Sammy to complications from sickle cell anemia.  Image zoom Delilah Instagram  Now, with Zack’s passing, she’s taking a leave of absence from her radio show to mourn and turning towards her husband, family and millions of listeners for comfort. Says the rep, “The lady who is there for everyone else every single night now needs our love and our prayers sent right back to her.”  For more on Delilah’s painful loss, pick up this week’s issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.  Suicide Prevention: What to Know  Experts say some common warning signs of suicide include discussing a desire to die or feeling anxious or hopeless, like a burden, or trapped or in pain; withdrawing from others; extreme mood swings, including anger and recklessness; and abnormal sleep patterns (sleeping too much or too little).  Many suicides have multiple causes and are not triggered by one event, according to experts, who underline that suicidal crises can be overcome with help. Where mental illness is a factor, it can be treated.  Reaching out to those in need is a simple and effective preventative measure, experts say.",

Then, there's Blake Lively, who shared on Instagram exactly how hard she worked to lose weight after giving birth to her second child in September 2016.  The 30-year-old actress revealed on Instagram Monday that she lost 61 pounds in the months since giving birth, posing in a sports bra and leggings and thanking her trainer Don Saladino for helping her with the process.  \"Turns out you can’t lose the 61 lbs you gained during pregnancy by just scrolling through Instagram and wondering why you don’t look like all the bikini models,\" Lively wrote. \"Thanks @donsaladino for kicking my A double S into shape. 10 months to gain, 14 months to lose. Feeling very proud.\"  \"Couldn’t be more proud @blakelively! 61 pounds in 14 months after baby number 2!\" Saladino captioned a matching snap on his own account. \"Doesn’t she look awesome?\"  Saladino, who has also whipped Lively into shape for several film roles, told Cosmopolitan in 2016 how he helped the actress train forThe Shallows after giving birth to her daughter James in 2014. Lively's regimen called for five or six workouts a week, with sessions lasting from 30 to 75 minutes.  \"She never questions me. She always does what I want her to do,\" Saladino said, praising his client's can-do attitude, while still being understanding of her needs as a new mom. \"If she comes in, and being like any other mom, she was up all night with the baby and didn't sleep well, I'm not going to beat the crap out of her.

        "text": "Charmed type TV Show network WB genre Sci-fi  Drama  Original Charmed stars Holly Marie Combs and Shannen Doherty have already addressed The CW’s upcoming reboot. Now the third sister is sharing her thoughts.  “I wish that they would have come to us and we would have been involved since the beginning,” Alyssa Milano said during an interview with Entertainment Tonight. “But having said that, I do hope that it reaches the newer generation and impacts that generation the way ours was able to do for its generation.”  The CW greenlit the self-described “fierce,” “funny,” “feminist” reboot with Sarah Jeffery, Melonie Diaz, and Madeleine Mantock as three sisters who discover they’re actually witches. They must then try to balance their life in a college town with supernatural demon-hunting.  Milano costarred with Combs and Doherty in the original series. Rose McGowan came on as long-lost half sister Paige when Doherty’s Prue character was killed off.  Combs, especially, has been very vocal about the reboot. “Let me say first that I appreciate the jobs and opportunities the Charmed reboot has created,” she wrote, in part, through a statement. “But I will never understand what is fierce, funny, or feminist in creating a show that basically says the original actresses are too old to do a job they did 12 years ago. I hope the new show is far better than the marketing so the true legacy does remain.”  Doherty had also tweeted initially that the concept was “offensive.” She added, “I love Charmed. I also want it to be respected. I’m simply choosing to be constructive about it because negativity has no place in my life.”  The new stars and producers have responded to the pushback, also coming from certain pockets of the original fans, multiple times. During the Television Critics Association tour, Mantock said, “Of course, you can’t help but feel disappointed because I think the script is fantastic. I really hope maybe [Combs will] see it and like it.”  Executive producers Jennie Snyder Urman and Jessica O’Toole also noted how the original show “wrapped up everything up so wonderfully” and they “didn’t want to mess with that mythology, obviously, because it was eight years.”  “None of us from the original cast to the original creators, producers, or writers have anything to do with it,” Milano said in a recent interview with Parade. “The way I feel about it is this, and I’ll just be super, super-honest: If the reboot can give the joy that it gave to our generation to a new generation, then I think that’s really beautiful. Time after time, I’ve heard story after story about how that show meant so much to people, because it was a show that they found while they were battling cancer, or it was a show that they watched with their father, and that was the only thing they could connect with. It really resonated with people in a profound way, and if a new generation can find that, then I think that’s really beautiful.”  She suggests the new showrunners “shouldn’t try to reinvent the wheel, but really take what was so great about the original and find a way to make it their own.”  “I’m just glad that it’s here finally, because we’ve been hearing about this reboot for however many years, what has it been, maybe four years now?” she added. “And I feel like it’s either going to succeed or not, and if it succeeds again, a whole new generation will be exposed to the beauty of what Charmed was able to be for people, and if it doesn’t succeed, then we don’t have to hear about it anymore.”",

PHOTOS: Recent celeb babies  “I thought I couldn’t be in labor,” yoga pro Hilaria tells Us Weekly of her early morning pains. Earlier that same day a doctor had told the spouses of three years that their baby boy was still two weeks away from arriving.  But it turns out the doc was wrong and Hilaria had a 23-hour labor ahead of her. The 31-year-old cofounder of NYC’s Yoga Vida admitted she was in tears after the birth of her son while Alec, 57, was in awe.  PHOTOS: Pregnant celebs in bikinis  “It’s his first son,” she says.”He can’t even believe it,” adding, “Alec does other things, not change diapers.”  The family of four, including the couple’s 22-month-old daughter Carmen, posed for an exclusive newborn photo shoot taken by Hilaria’s pal Eroula Dimitriou in the couple’s NYC home.  “She wants to kiss him, hold him, sing to him, and feed him food he can’t eat,” Hilaria tells Us of Carmen. “She’s a good big sister.”  PHOTOS: Celeb baby announcements  As for the family’s plans to expand (Alec is also dad to 19-year-old Ireland Baldwin with ex-wife Kim Basinger), Hilaria notes, “I think we’ll have one more eventually.”  PHOTOS: Stars' shocking post-baby bodies  For more photos of the Baldwin’s beautiful family photo shoot, pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly on stands now!",

Jenner Leans On New Girlfriend For Support As She Goes Deaf  Caitlyn's Hearing Hell! Jenner Leans On New Girlfriend For Support As She Goes Deaf New arm candy Sophia Hutchins doesn’t judge former Olympian for wearing hearing aids.  Caitlyn Jenner has been spotted sporting hearing aids, sparking fears the transgender star may be heading toward another transition — deafness, but thankfully, the former Olympian has new girlfriend Sophia Hutchins as a shoulder to lean on.  Jenner, 68, was snapped wearing the devices during her recent beach holiday in Mexico with her 21-year-old new trans arm candy.  “Cait’s hearing has gotten worse over the years, and she can’t hear much without them,” a source told RadarOnline.com exclusively. “She’s tried covering them up with her hair, but the beach wind exposed them to the world!”  Sophia, a student at California’s Pepperdine University, credits the famous former athlete for inspiring her gender reassignment surgery.  What’s more, she’s been totally supportive as Caitlyn struggles with hearing issues.  “Sophia doesn’t judge Cait for wearing hearing aids. In fact, she said that she wanted to get a pair just like them when the time comes, which made Cait laugh,” dished the insider.  But Cait’s fading hearing is no joke to family insiders. “They’re worried that Cait’s happiness is clouding the bigger issue — she might be going deaf!” added the source.  As Radar exclusively reported, things between the two have been heating up for the past few months. Hutchins posted frequent pictures of Jenner’s dog and tell-tale shots about their relationship from the Sherwood Country Club, where her girlfriend was a member and an avid golfer.  Hutchins continues to hint her relationship with Jenner is going strong as the younger girlfriend posted another picture with a clue about their romance just last week! She posted an Instagram story where she was hugging Jenner’s dog, Bertha, and captioned the pic “cuddling with my love bug,” on Halloween, the same day Radar exclusively revealed details about their hidden relationship.

        "text": "Movement against sexual harrassment  Time's Up is a movement against sexual harassment and was founded on January 1, 2018, by Hollywood celebrities[2] in response to the Weinstein effect and #MeToo. As of December 2018 , it has raised more than $22 million for its legal defense fund, and gathered nearly 800 volunteer lawyers.[3]  History  In November 2017, the Alianza Nacional de Campesinas wrote a letter of solidarity to the Hollywood women involved in exposing the sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein. The letter, published in Time, described experiences of assault and harassment among female farmworkers. The letter stated that it was written on behalf of the approximately 700,000 female farmworkers in the United States.[4]  Partly in response, Time's Up was announced in The New York Times on January 1, 2018. The announcement cited the letter of support from the Alianza Nacional de Campesinas and the desire to support women, men, people of color, and the LGBT community who have less access to media platforms and funds to speak up about harassment.[1] At its founding, the following initiatives were announced:  A $13-million legal defense fund, administered by the National Women's Law Center, to support lower-income women seeking justice for sexual harassment and assault in the workplace  Advocating for legislation to punish companies that tolerate persistent harassment  A movement toward gender parity in studio and talent agencies  Calling for women and men on the red carpet at the 75th Golden Globe Awards to wear black and speak out about sexual harassment and assault.  Mark Wahlberg and William Morris Endeavor, his talent agency, donated more than $2 million to Time's Up in early January 2018 in the name of Wahlberg's co-star Michelle Williams from All the Money in the World. This occurred after it was revealed that Williams (who is represented by the same agency) received $800 for 10 days to redo certain scenes in the movie, while Wahlberg received $1.5 million for the same 10 days of work.[5]  Attendees of the 2018 Grammys including Lady Gaga, Lana Del Rey, Kesha and Cyndi Lauper wore white roses or all-black outfits to express solidarity with the Time's Up movement.[6] Lorde wore an excerpt from a work by Jenny Holzer, printed on a card stitched onto the back of her dress; the excerpt read, \"Rejoice! Our times are intolerable. Take courage, for the worst is a harbinger of the best. Only dire circumstance can precipitate the overthrow of oppressors. The old & corrupt must be laid to waste before the just can triumph. Contradiction will be heightened. The reckoning will be hastened by the staging of seed disturbances. The apocalypse will blossom.\"[7][6] Lorde wrote, \"My version of a white rose — THE APOCALYPSE WILL BLOSSOM — an excerpt from the greatest of all time, Jenny Holzer.\"[6]  At the 2018 Grammy's Kesha performed her song \"Praying\", while she stood in unity with fellow female songwriters/artists all wearing white to show their alliance in believing women, and that women will no longer be silenced.[8]  At the 2018 BAFTA Film Awards in London, attendees wore black and Time’s Up pins.[9]  In late 2018, Lisa Borders, former president of the WNBA and former Coca-Cola executive, was named the organization's first president and chief executive officer.[10] On February 18, 2019, she stepped down due to her son being accused of sexual misconduct.[11] Tina Tchen was named as chief executive in October of 2019.[12]  In January 2019, the organization launched its 4% challenge, asking production companies to show their commitment to working with a female director on a feature production in the next 18 months. Universal Pictures, MGM Studios, Paramount Pictures and Amazon Studios were among a number of prominent entertainment companies to pledge their support for the challenge.[13][14]  Founding signatories  On the website is an open letter to women of the world, standing in solidarity and affirming the signatories' action to tackle sexual harassment and assault. The letter was signed by almost 400 predominantly British and American women in the entertainment industry and the DMK cosmetics foundation.[15] Signatories include Shonda Rhimes and the actresses from her headliner ABC shows Grey's Anatomy and Scandal, including Jessica Capshaw as well as her mother, Kate Capshaw, who has individually spoken out with husband Steven Spielberg on the \"national and global problem\" that needs to be tackled \"as an imperative.\"[16]  Legal defense fund  Lawyers Roberta Kaplan and Tina Tchen co-founded the Time’s Up legal defense fund, which had raised $22 million as of October 2018 to provide legal defense for sexual violence victims, especially those who experienced misconduct in the workplace.[17][18] It has access to over 780 attorneys. According to the National Women’s Law Center (NWLC) which administers the fund, about 40% of those requesting help are women of color and 65% of them are low-income, from ind...",

Cable and satellite subscribers will once again be able to watch the two-hour event live on the apps for those Turner TV channels. And for the first time in the 24-year history of these awards bestowed by the Screen Actors Guild, the ceremony will be available on a variety of streaming services: DirecTV Now, Fubo TV, Hulu Live TV, Sling TV, Sony PlayStation Vue, and YouTube TV.  Those who tune in by whatever means will get to see these women announcing the winners of the Screen Actors Guild Awards: Rosanna Arquette, Halle Berry, SAG-AFTRA President Gabrielle Carteris, Dakota Fanning, Mandy Moore, Olivia Munn, Niecy Nash, Lupita Nyong’o, Gina Rodriguez, Maya Rudolph, Emma Stone, Marisa Tomei and Kelly Marie Tran.  As always, the telecast will open with various actors telling their stories of how they got their guild cards. This year, it will only be women in the spotlight. The only men you will see on the stage of the Shrine Auditorium will be the winners of the five races for male actors as well as those in the casts of the winning ensembles and the nominated films.  SEE 2018 SAG Awards: What time does the show start, who will win, who hosts?

The new parents are struggling to find quality time together as they juggle their busy careers and care for their 11-month-old son, Bear, the source told MailOnline.  A source has told MailOnline that Cheryl is spending a lot of time at home on her own with Bear because she would rather stay in watching soaps on TV than go out to showbiz parties.  Concerned fans have pointed out that the couple have not been pictured together for some time and were not photographed together on Valentine's Day.  Instead Liam posted an Instagram picture of Bear on Wednesday with the caption: 'Happy Valentine's Day @cherylofficial and everyone. Looks like I've got the big guy to compete with now.'  Cheryl Cole and Liam Payne's relationship is 'strained' as he is spending nights away from home while she looks after their baby son, a friend has claimed  Cheryl and Liam are struggling to find quality time together as they juggle their busy careers and care for their 11-month-old son, Bear, the source told MailOnline  The post hid Bear's face but focused on his personalised babygro which read: 'Bear is Mummy's little Valentine.' Fans believed he had taken the picture.  Cheryl - who is living at their £5.6million country home in Surrey - did not publicly respond to his message.  A source told MailOnline: 'Cheryl basically went into hibernation when she got pregnant and has made the decision to be a stay at home mother with no nanny and is looking after bear herself. She doesn’t like going out much as she used to.'  Fans have recently questioned why the couple have not been pictured on social media together since August last year.  Fans of the couple are concerned that they haven't been pictured together since August  The last time they were seen in public was at The X Factor last October.  A friend Cheryl said: 'The fact of the matter is, like most young couple's with busy work lives and the demands of an infant they have been struggling to spend time together.  'There are the very real strains of trying to adapt to parenthood whilst being in the spotlight and having to appear as though everything is rosy all of the time.  'It is not real life and is not the life Cheryl and Liam are currently living as a couple.'  Cheryl has been supported by her brother Gary and his partner, who she has moved into Liam's home in Woking.  The Fight for this Love star sparked engagement rumours by showing off a whopping diamond on her ring finger during The Prince's Trust gala last Thursday. She has since been seen without the ring.  The source added: 'Cheryl just wants what every woman wants. A loving, happy family and someone to grow old with.  'There is no doubt she wants more children - but it is fair to say at the moment there is a lot of pressure on both her and Liam. Being apart isn't helping that.'  The couple's lack of public outings together has already puzzled fans. One tweeted: 'Hey @LiamPayne the last (time) you posted a selfie on Instagram with Cheryl was August last year.  Could you bless us with a new one please Liam. @CherylOfficial.' Another follower wrote: '@CherylOfficial hello, I miss your selfies with liam x'.  Instead of a picture of Cheryl, Liam posted this photograph of Bear on Wednesday with the caption: 'Happy Valentine's Day @cherylofficial and everyone. Looks like I've got the big guy to compete with now.'  Cheryl was recently pictured with two fans as she recorded her television comeback on the BBC's new talent show, The Greatest Dancer  The Fight for this Love star sparked engagement rumours by showing off a whopping diamond on her ring finger during The Prince's Trust gala last Thursday  Liam has been busy promoting his Fifty Shades movie track with Rita Ora and putting the finishing touches to his new album.  It is understood he spends much of his time with Steve Finan, head of music at his management company Doyen Global.  The ex-One Direction star took on the firm - headed by David Beckham's right hand man Simon Oliveira - in a bid for maximum exposure.  Since then he has been criticised for a new 'gangster image', which has seen the star posting images of himself in gold chains, posing on jets and even draped over a statue of a lion.  Fans have taken to Twitter urging Cheryl to 'sort Liam out'. One fan wrote: '@LiamPayne is so cringe @CherylOfficial sort out your man's dess sense it's embarrassing'.  Another tweeted: 'Why's @LiamPayne being all gangster it doesn't suit him, he was better when was sweet n innocent sort him out @CherylOfficial [sic]'.  Cheryl meanwhile, has been back in the recording studio with producers Team Salut and is keen to make a return to solo music.  Liam has been blasted by fans for his bizarre 'gangsta' poses in photos posted on Instagram  Liam looked like he was going to kiss Rita Ora during a performance of their new duet 'For You'...",

The actress, 38, dressed casually chic in a long-sleeve ruffled white top with black pants and color coordinated heels while her only child wore a star-patterned dress with a big red bow in her hair.  Holmes and Swift, 27, previously crossed paths working on the 2014 film The Giver.  Backstage, the pair were also spotted mingling with artists and celebrities with Holmes taking a photo with host Elvis Duran.

Swift performed her hits “Shake It Off,” “…Ready for It?,” “I Don’t Want to Live Forever” and “Look What You Made Me Do” during her set. Similar to her Los Angeles show, the reputation hitmaker brought out Ed Sheeran to perform their duet “End Game.”  This week, Holmes has been in the Big Apple attending a handful of events, including the opening of the Privé Revaux store, which was launched by her long-rumored partner Jamie Foxx.",

The Queen stepped up her own fashion game, wearing a pale blue wool tweed dress and jacket embellished with tiny aquamarine Swarovski crystals by Angela Kelly (who sat to Wintour’s left). She even added a pair of black gloves to her look. Wintour had on her signature shades and a floral dress as she sat next to the monarch.

From the tweed of the Hebrides to Nottingham lace, and of course Carnaby Street, our fashion industry has been renowned for outstanding craftsmanship for many years, and continues to produce world-class textiles and cutting edge, practical designs.  “As a tribute to the industry, and as my legacy to all those who have contributed to British fashion, I would like to present this award for new, young talent. I would like to thank the British Fashion Council for selecting the first winner – Richard Quinn.”  The Queen’s visit to the London Fashion Week headquarters had been kept secret and her low-key arrival caused a ripple of astonishment among attendees.

She then made a beeline for Harvy Santos, a “new wave” hat maker who had created a crown out of leather and studs based on Queen Victoria’s traveling crown.

But she was just lovely.”  Image zoom Queen Elizabeth Yui Mok/PA Wire/AP  Philippine-born Santos, a former ballet dancer continued: “She was just lovely and so softly spoken. She was interested in my crown and what inspired me. I also told her about my former career as a dancer and she joked, ‘That must have been quite a leap,’ ”  “I thought I was the only Queen here, but I have been dethroned today! I couldn’t have been happier about it,” he added.",

We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another. ”  The couple announced that they split at the end of the last year, however, they celebrated the New Year together with their annual vacation to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico alongside a handful of close pals including Jason Bateman and his family.  Image zoom Pharrell and Jennifer Aniston at Ellen DeGeneres’ birthday.  The two spent quite a bit of time apart in recent months raising questions. Theroux was often spotted in New York City away from their L.A. home. They have also had a busy year as Aniston signed on with Reese Witherspoon for a new Apple TV series and filmed Dumplin’ in Atlanta, while Theroux, 46, filmed the comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me in Budapest.  On Saturday, Aniston made an appearance at Ellen DeGeneres‘ birthday party without Theroux. She was spotted standing outside the Hollywood venue chatting with Pharrell.  The next day, the actress rang in her 49th birthday without the actor. Aniston celebrated in Malibu, California with a gathering including pals Courteney Cox, Andrea Bendewald, Leigh Kilton-Smith and Kristin Hahn on Sunday.  Theroux, meanwhile, was spotted out in New York City on Friday walking his dog. (Last year, the duo vacationed together in Los Cabos, Mexico with friends).  Image zoom Justin Theroux walks his dog in N.Y.C. days before Jennifer Aniston’s birthday. Splash News Online  Sources recently told PEOPLE that their busy schedules worked for both of them and helped their marriage.  “Justin often spends a few days in NYC by himself,” a source previously told PEOPLE. “When he is in NYC, Jen will catch up with friends and enjoys her own life. When Justin is in L.A., it’s very special for them. They socialize together with friends. They often go out to dinner or have people over.”  Aniston showed off the $21 million L.A. home they designed together in the March issue of Architectural Digest, saying, “I look around at my husband and my dogs and our home, and there’s nowhere else I want to be.”  Aniston and Theroux first met on the Hawaii set of 2008’s Tropic Thunder and began dating in 2011. They later married in a surprise and secret ceremony on August 5, 2015 — just a few days before Theroux’s 44th birthday. A source close to the actress told PEOPLE at the time that the two were happy to have pulled off the surprise wedding, inviting friends to a backyard party under the ruse of celebrating Theroux’s birthday.  RELATED: Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux Were the Picture Perfect Couple During Their Last Vacation  “They seemed ecstatic,” the source said. “They celebrated late and barely slept, but they were in the best mood. They were giddy to have pulled off an amazing wedding celebration with their friends. And they were proud to finally be married.”  Aniston was previously married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005 after starting their relationship in 1998. She later dated Vince Vaughn and John Mayer after her divorce from Pitt.",

We know now that Kylie's daughter is called Stormi Webster, but until that record-breaking announcement came, the most convincing theory was that the new baby was going to be called something butterfly-related. Eagle-eyed fans spotted all sorts of butterfly references in the 11-minute long announcement video, and it all seemed very plausible.    There were all sorts of butterflies featured in the video YouTube/ELLE  Except, the theory was actually pretty flawed. Because Kylie Jenner hates butterflies, it turns out. And fans who watched Life of Kylie might remember the episode that proves it.  When Kylie, Victoria and Jordyn took a trip to the London Zoo, they stopped off for a visit at the butterfly exhibit. But it quickly became clear that Kylie was scared shitless of butterflies.  This content is imported from YouTube.

        "text": "American actor  Val Edward Kilmer (born December 31, 1959)[2] is an American actor, musician and artist. Originally a stage actor, Kilmer became popular in the mid-1980s after a string of appearances in comedy films, starting with Top Secret! (1984) and Real Genius (1985), as well as the military action film Top Gun (1986), and the fantasy film Willow (1988).  Some of his other notable film roles include Jim Morrison in The Doors (1991), an apparition of Elvis Presley in True Romance (1993), Doc Holliday in Tombstone (1993), Chris Shiherlis in Heat (1995), Bruce Wayne / Batman in Batman Forever (1995), Simon Templar in The Saint (1997), Moses in The Prince of Egypt (1998), \"Gay Perry\" in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), and Dieter Von Cunth in MacGruber (2010).  Kilmer is also author of the book, I'm Your Huckleberry: A Memoir, published in 2020.[3]  Early life [ edit ]  Kilmer was born December 31, 1959, in Los Angeles,[2] the son of Gladys Swanette (née Ekstadt; 1928–2019)[4] and Eugene Dorris Kilmer (1921–1993)[5], an aerospace equipment distributor and real estate developer.[6] His mother was of Swedish descent.[7] His father's ancestry included English, Scottish-Irish, French and German.[8][9] His parents divorced in 1968 when he was 8 years old. Kilmer's grandfather was a gold miner in New Mexico, near the border with Arizona.[10] In 1977 Kilmer's younger brother Wesley, who had received a diagnosis of epilepsy, drowned in a jacuzzi at age 15; their father died in 1993.[11][12]  Kilmer attended Berkeley Hall School, a Christian Science school in Los Angeles, until ninth grade.[13] He attended Chatsworth High School with Kevin Spacey and Mare Winningham, and also attended the Hollywood Professional School.[2] He became the youngest person at the time to be accepted into the Juilliard School's Drama Division, where he was a member of Group 10.[14]  Career [ edit ]  1980s [ edit ]  In 1981, while at The Juilliard, Kilmer co-authored and starred in the play How It All Began,[15] which was performed at the Public Theater at the New York Shakespeare Festival. Kilmer turned down a role in Francis Ford Coppola's 1983 film The Outsiders, as he had prior theatre commitments.[16] In 1983 he appeared off Broadway in The Slab Boys with Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn. That same year, his first off-stage acting role (excluding television commercials) came in the form of an episode of ABC Afterschool Special called One Too Many, which was an educational drama on drinking and driving;[17] it also starred a young Michelle Pfeiffer. Also in 1983, Kilmer self-published a collection of his own poetry entitled My Edens After Burns, that included poems inspired by his time with Pfeiffer. The book of poems is difficult to obtain, and expensive; even second-hand copies fetch $300 and up.[18][19][20]  His big break came when he received top billing in the comedy spoof of spy movies Top Secret!, in which he played an American rock and roll star. Kilmer sang all the songs in the film and released an album under the film character's name, \"Nick Rivers.\"[21] While garnering more substantial roles and prestige, he also gained a reputation as a ladies' man, dating numerous women, some many years older, including Cher and Ellen Barkin.[20]  During a brief hiatus, he backpacked throughout Europe before going on to play the lead character in the 1985 comedy Real Genius. He turned down a role in David Lynch's Blue Velvet[22] before being cast as naval aviator \"Iceman\" in the action film Top Gun alongside Tom Cruise. Top Gun grossed a total of $344,700,000 worldwide and made Kilmer a major star.[23] Following roles in the television films The Murders in the Rue Morgue and The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains, Kilmer played Madmartigan in the fantasy Willow; he met his future wife, co-star Joanne Whalley, on the film's set. Kilmer starred in the Colorado Shakespeare Festival production of Hamlet in 1988. In 1989, Kilmer played the lead in both Kill Me Again, again opposite Whalley, and in TNT's Billy the Kid.  1990s [ edit ]  After several delays, director Oliver Stone finally started production on the film The Doors, based on the band of the same name. Kilmer spoke with Oliver Stone early on, concerned about what he might want to do with the story because Kilmer did not believe in or want to promote substance abuse. Kilmer saw Morrison as having picked the wrong heroes, who had different issues, which were not part of the creativity or inspiration. Kilmer saw Morrison's story as one that could be told \"a thousand different ways\" and did not want to tell it by playing the role in the style of drugs, with which Oliver Stone agreed.[24] Kilmer memorized the lyrics to all of lead singer Jim Morrison's songs prior to his audition and sent a video of himself performing some Doors songs to director Stone. Stone was not impressed with the tape, but Paul Rothchild (the original producer of The Doors) said \"I was shaken by it\" and suggested they record Kilmer in ...",

Hosts Chip and Joanna Gaines announced Tuesday that the upcoming fifth season of the home renovation series will be its last.  \"It is with both sadness and expectation that we share the news that season 5 of Fixer Upper will be our last. While we are confident that this is the right choice for us, it has for sure not been an easy one to come to terms with,\" they wrote on their blog Tuesday. \"Our family has grown up alongside yours, and we have felt you rooting us on from the other side of the screen. How bittersweet to say goodbye to the very thing that introduced us all in the first place.\"  The married couple, who have four children, also opened up in their post about why they're walking away from the wildly successful series, citing their exhausting schedule and also addressing recent rumors of marital issues. \"We would be foolish to think we can go and go and fire on all cylinders and never stop to pause. Our family is healthy and our marriage has honestly never been stronger,\" they wrote. \"This has nothing to do with a fraudulent skincare line or anything else you’ll inevitably read. This is just us recognizing that we need to catch our breath for a moment. Our plan is to take this time to shore up and strengthen the spots that are weak, rest the places that are tired and give lots of love and attention to both our family and our businesses.\"  According to their post, the final season of Fixer Upper will launch in November. Debuting on HGTV in 2013, the makeover series sees the pair renovate old houses in and around their base of Waco, Texas, as they aim to not only create a better house, but also a better neighborhood. The show has become one of HGTV's biggest hits, doubling its ratings in its second season and drawing A-list fans like Taylor Swift and Leslie Jones.  The most recent season ran 17 episodes and wrapped in March and drew 3.7 million viewers. Season five was part of a multi-season renewal aimed to keep the show on the air through 2018, when the series finale will now air. The success of the series also been a boon for the Gaines personally. Joanna's Instagram boasts 5.3 million followers, while Chip has 2.5 million. The duo recently launched their own Target line, among their other business ventures.  Despite the staggering success of Fixer Upper, the Gaines have been careful about expanding their brand too much, notably insisting on doing no more than 16 episodes a season of the series. \"We're local businesspeople, so we're thinking very local. 'Seize it while it's here,' that's what we hear, but we want this brand to last,\" Joanna told THR in 2016. \"TV is just part of the equation.\"  High Noon Entertainment produced the series for HGTV.",

        "text": "Spoile­rs aren't coming­  Remember last year, when the Game of Thrones fan community had a field day after the scripts of the entire show were leaked online, well in advance to their TV release? It might have been fun for us but not for the team behind the hit HBO series.  In order to prevent something like this happening again, the Emmy Award-winning show has taken extreme measures this year. Code names, secret sets, disappearing scripts — Game of Thrones has gone to great lengths to keep secrets for its upcoming final season.  According to E Online!, rumour had it that multiple endings were being shot to throw off spoiler spies, but starlet Maisie Williams denied anything remotely close to happening on her appearance on the Jimmy Kimmel Live show.  “Well, I heard this, and I immediately thought, ‘I don’t think we’ve got the budget to shoot lots of different endings’,” Williams said.  However, Williams’ co-star and onscreen sibling, Sophie Turner revealed what actually happened to keep the secrets of season eight. Turner confirmed the reports of self-destructing scripts (they wouldn’t blow up, this isn’t a movie), but said “it’s all true.”  “I mean, we wouldn’t get anything physical. We would have it on an app. We would get sent sides for the scenes we were shooting the next day. So we would have to learn it all the day before,” Turner told Digital Spy. “And once you’d read it, it disappeared 24 hours later, and you could never access it again. It’s tighter than the White House security!”  Turner’s comments support what Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who plays Jaime Lannister on the show, had previously said about the scripts. “They’re very, very strict. It’s reached a crazy level this year,” he revealed to Esquire. “We actually get the scripts and we shoot the scene but we only have it digitally and when you’ve done the scene, it just vanishes. It’s like Mission: Impossible…‘This will self-destruct’.”  Not just this but visitors on the set would be asked to cover their phone cameras to avoid any pictures being taken. Also, the cast had code names as well, Turner revealed, so that nobody would know who was really on set that day. The show itself also had a code name too: Face of Angels.  “It’s a random one!” the actor had said.  As for the ending, Coster-Waldau said he was satisfied. “I also know that we end the right way and the show ends on its own terms,” he said. “When I read the scripts for the last season I was like, ‘Wow, they really pulled it off’.”  The cast has been paying tribute to the series as production comes to an end. Williams recently marked the end of filming with a bloody Instagram post, Turner got a tattoo to commemorate her time on the series and Emilia Clarke penned an emotional note to Belfast, the country they filmed in.  Game of Thrones returns to HBO in 2019.  Have something to add to the story? Share it in the comments below.  Read full story",

        "text": "Not since Alicia Machado became the breakout star of the first presidential debate seven months ago—that’s half a century in Trump news cycle years—have the disparate worlds of pageantry and politics been so intertwined. Kára McCullough, our new reigning Miss USA, sparked controversy during Sunday night’s crowning due to her polarizing opinions on two separate issues: feminism and health care. Unlike so many of our elected politicians, McCullough’s soundbites were definitive, articulate, and to the point. But it was the content of McCullough’s politics, not her delivery, that left viewers sounding off on social media well into Monday morning. To recap, Miss District of Columbia became an unconventional alt-right darling by insisting that health care is a privilege, not a right. “I’m definitely going to say it is a privilege,” McCullough offered during the 30-second question and answer portion of the pageant. “As a government employee, I am granted health care and I see firsthand that to have health care, you need to have jobs.”  Much to the chagrin of Twitter eggs everywhere, the 25-year-old McCullough has since clarified her position on health care, explaining on Good Morning America that, “I am privileged to have health care and I do believe that it should be a right, and I hope and pray moving forward that health care is a right for all worldwide.” But McCullough is less likely to backtrack on her other controversial opinion of the night—the revelation that she self-identifies not as a feminist, but as an equalist. “I try not to consider myself this die-hard, like, I don’t really care about men,” she infamously insisted on Sunday night’s broadcast. During a victory tour interview at the top of New York’s Empire State Building, a wind-blown McCullough (complete with sash and crown) doubles down on her decision to identify as an equalist. “I’m just about being equal,” McCullough tells The Daily Beast, before insisting that, “I’m all about women’s rights.”  As a scientist at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission with a degree in radiochemistry, McCullough has experience succeeding in a traditionally male-dominated field. In fact, she’s consistently spoken out about the importance of supporting women and girls in STEM, a platform that, for many, made her reluctance to call herself a feminist even more surprising. Still, McCullough insists, “I do want to see women flourish in just every aspect of life, whether it is in the medical sciences, or whether it’s in the government agencies and in STEM. I’m just saying in total we have to look at ourselves as, ‘we are equal.’” McCullough pauses and smiles before reaching for a pageant conclusion: “Women have made so many strides, and I’m looking forward to this next generation of women coming up.”  Equalism aside, McCullough has been heralded as an outstanding role model on multiple fronts: not just as a black female scientist, but as a pageant beauty who insists on wearing her natural curls. McCullough concedes that in a time when images of natural black hair are still under-represented in pop culture, her decision was, of course, a deliberate one. “When I came to the conclusion to wear my hair natural, I wanted to be authentic,” she explains. “And I feel the most liberated and happy with my natural curly hair. Typically, you don’t really see women on the pageant stage with their natural hair. You’re always told to straighten your hair, that it looks more professional, it looks more put together.” McCullough stops just short of explaining the racism intrinsic to this particular brand of pageant advice—we are at an Empire State Building press junket, after all—and chooses her next words carefully. “I wasn’t necessarily trying to challenge the status quo,” she continues. “I just wanted to be comfortable. And that’s the message that I want to send to so many young women: do what makes you comfortable.”  Ten years ago, Miss USA would most likely be answering questions about her exercise routine or her favorite home-cooked meal. But, perhaps given the pageant’s history as a part of Donald Trump’s extensive entertainment portfolio, politics appear to have become a part of the competition. McCullough seems up to the challenge of wearing the crown during one of the most turbulent political moments in recent memory. In fact, she’s excited that Sunday’s Miss USA amounted to more than just channel surfing fodder. “We’re starting a conversation!” She exclaims. “We’re pressing on issues that are prominent in our nation right now…Everyone has an opinion, and I’m glad.”  McCullough insists that while “I don’t have a political agenda, I’m not trying to be a politician,” she’s open to using her platform to discuss more political issues in the future. “If matters are pressing on my heart, and I feel as if I’m the one involved in that type of situation, then sure, I’ll speak out about it,” she offers, before concluding that, “I’m just trying to go with the flow.”  As for her personal...",

Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott were guests at MTV’s epic awards show on Aug. 20, but some fans thought they didn’t look like they were enjoying themselves enough… especially during Jennifer Lopez’s epic medley performance!  JLo was honored with the annual Video Vanguard award, but before she accepted it she performed a medley of basically every song you can think of. “Get Right,” “Jenny From The Block,” “Get On The Floor,” “Ain’t Yo Momma,” “Love Don’t Cost A Thing,” seriously, all the faves. To make it more epic, she brought out Ja Rule, DJ Khaled, and more stars to perform with her.  And yet, when the cameras cut to the audience, they caught Kylie and Travis just sitting there, staring off into space without so much as a smile. Meanwhile, everyone around them was up out of their chairs dancing the night away, as you do. Suffice it to say, fans were offended by the #disrespect.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  While some fans said you could “cut the tension” between the two, Chmerkovskiy, 37, and Lachey, 36 actually appeared to be a very loving pair behind the scenes during the live show.  During the commercial break before their performance, Lachey and Chmerkovskiy both took time to chat with Lachey’s two older children, who were sitting in the front row before Chmerkovskiy led Lachey to the middle of the ballroom to rehearse their dance.  After running though the routine, Lachey went back over to her children. Chmerkovksiy jokingly slid by a few minutes later, making Lachey giggle before they got into their place as the show picked up after the commercials.

Despite sources telling PEOPLE that things have been tense in the rehearsal room, Lachey relied on Chmerkovskiy for comfort during Monday’s emotional elimination.  When it was announced that her husband, Nick Lachey, was not in jeopardy of elimination for the first time in three weeks, she threw herself into Chmerkovskiy’s arms.

        "text": "Diagnosis  There's no specific test for Bell's palsy. Your doctor will look at your face and ask you to move your facial muscles by closing your eyes, lifting your brow, showing your teeth and frowning, among other movements.  Other conditions — such as a stroke, infections, Lyme disease and tumors — can cause facial muscle weakness that mimics Bell's palsy. If the cause of your symptoms isn't clear, your doctor may recommend other tests, including:  Electromyography (EMG). This test can confirm the presence of nerve damage and determine its severity. An EMG measures the electrical activity of a muscle in response to stimulation and the nature and speed of the conduction of electrical impulses along a nerve.  This test can confirm the presence of nerve damage and determine its severity. An measures the electrical activity of a muscle in response to stimulation and the nature and speed of the conduction of electrical impulses along a nerve. Imaging scans. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) may be needed on occasion to rule out other possible sources of pressure on the facial nerve, such as a tumor or skull fracture.  Treatment  Most people with Bell's palsy recover fully — with or without treatment. There's no one-size-fits-all treatment for Bell's palsy, but your doctor may suggest medications or physical therapy to help speed your recovery. Surgery is rarely an option for Bell's palsy.  Medications  Commonly used medications to treat Bell's palsy include:  Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are powerful anti-inflammatory agents. If they can reduce the swelling of the facial nerve, it will fit more comfortably within the bony corridor that surrounds it. Corticosteroids may work best if they're started within several days of when your symptoms started.  such as prednisone, are powerful anti-inflammatory agents. If they can reduce the swelling of the facial nerve, it will fit more comfortably within the bony corridor that surrounds it. Corticosteroids may work best if they're started within several days of when your symptoms started. Antiviral drugs. The role of antivirals remains unsettled. Antivirals alone have shown no benefit compared with placebo. Antivirals added to steroids are possibly beneficial for some people with Bell's palsy, but this is still unproved. However, despite this, valacyclovir (Valtrex) or acyclovir (Zovirax) is sometimes given in combination with prednisone in people with severe facial palsy.  Physical therapy  Paralyzed muscles can shrink and shorten, causing permanent contractures. A physical therapist can teach you how to massage and exercise your facial muscles to help prevent this from occurring.  Surgery  In the past, decompression surgery was used to relieve the pressure on the facial nerve by opening the bony passage that the nerve passes through. Today, decompression surgery isn't recommended. Facial nerve injury and permanent hearing loss are possible risks associated with this surgery.  Rarely, plastic surgery may be needed to correct lasting facial nerve problems. Facial reanimation helps to make the face look more even and may restore facial movement. Examples of this type of surgery include eyebrow lift, eyelid lift, facial implants and nerve grafts. Some procedures, such as an eyebrow lift, may need to be repeated after several years.  Lifestyle and home remedies  Home treatment may include:  Protecting the eye you can't close. Using lubricating eyedrops during the day and an eye ointment at night will help keep your eye moist. Wearing glasses or goggles during the day and an eye patch at night can protect your eye from getting poked or scratched.

Massaging and exercising your face according to your physical therapist's advice may help relax your facial muscles.

For the British jazz, rock and house music singer, see Juliet Roberts  American actress and producer  Julia Fiona Roberts (born October 28, 1967)[1] is an American actress and producer. She established herself as a leading lady in Hollywood after headlining the romantic comedy film Pretty Woman (1990), which grossed $464 million worldwide. She has won three Golden Globe Awards, from eight nominations, and has been nominated for four Academy Awards for her film acting, winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Erin Brockovich (2000).  Her films have collectively brought box office receipts of over US$2.8 billion, making her one of the most bankable actresses in Hollywood.[2] Her most successful films include Mystic Pizza (1988), Steel Magnolias (1989), Pretty Woman (1990), Sleeping with the Enemy (1991), The Pelican Brief (1993), My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), Notting Hill (1999), Runaway Bride (1999), Erin Brockovich (2000), Ocean's Eleven (2001), Ocean's Twelve (2004), Charlie Wilson's War (2007), Valentine's Day (2010), Eat Pray Love (2010), Money Monster (2016), and Wonder (2017). Roberts was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for her performance in the HBO television film The Normal Heart (2014). In 2018, she starred in the Prime Video psychological thriller series Homecoming.  Roberts was the highest-paid actress in the world throughout most of the 1990s[3][4] and in the first half of the 2000s.[5] Her fee for 1990's Pretty Woman was US$300,000;[6] in 2003, she was paid an unprecedented $25 million for her role in Mona Lisa Smile (2003). As of 2017 , Roberts's net worth was estimated to be $170 million.[7] People magazine has named her the most beautiful woman in the world a record five times.[8]  Early life and family  Roberts was born on October 28, 1967, in Smyrna, Georgia,[1][9] to Betty Lou Bredemus (1934–2015) and Walter Grady Roberts (1933–1977).[1][9][10] She is of English, Scottish, Irish, Welsh, German, and Swedish descent.[11][12] Her father was a Baptist, her mother a Catholic,[13] and she was raised Catholic.[14][15] Her older brother Eric Roberts (b. 1956), from whom she was estranged for several years until 2004, older sister Lisa Roberts Gillan (b. 1965), and niece Emma Roberts, are also actors. She also had a younger half-sister named Nancy Motes (1976–2014).  Roberts' parents, one-time actors and playwrights, met while performing in theatrical productions for the armed forces. They later co-founded the Atlanta Actors and Writers Workshop in Atlanta, off Juniper Street in Midtown. They ran a children's acting school in Decatur, Georgia, while they were expecting Julia. The children of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King attended the school; Walter Roberts served as acting coach for their daughter, Yolanda Denise King.[16] As a thank-you for his service, Mrs. King paid Mrs. Roberts's hospital bill when Julia was born.[17]  Her parents married in 1955. Her mother filed for divorce in 1971; the divorce was finalized in early 1972.[18] From 1972, Roberts lived in Smyrna, Georgia, where she attended Fitzhugh Lee Elementary School, Griffin Middle School, and Campbell High School.[19] In 1972, her mother married Michael Motes, who was abusive and often unemployed; Roberts despised him.[20] The couple had Nancy, who died at 37 on February 9, 2014, of an apparent drug overdose.[21] The marriage ended in 1983, with Betty Lou divorcing Motes on cruelty grounds; she had stated that marrying him was the biggest mistake of her life.[20] Roberts's own father died of cancer when she was ten.[22]  Roberts wanted to be a veterinarian as a child.[23] She also played the clarinet in her school band.[24][25] After graduating from Smyrna's Campbell High School, she attended Georgia State University but did not graduate. She later headed to New York City to pursue a career in acting. Once there, she signed with the Click Modeling Agency and enrolled in acting classes.[26][27]  Acting career  1980s  Roberts made her first big screen appearance in the film Satisfaction (1988), alongside Liam Neeson and Justine Bateman, as a band member looking for a summer gig. She had previously performed a small role opposite her brother Eric, in Blood Red (she has two words of dialogue), filmed in 1987, although it was not released until 1989.

Everything that makes her special was on display in a recent photoshoot for InStyle in which Drew recreated her iconic childhood photos, and we can’t get enough of it.  A total ’80s baby and ’90s kid, Drew’s wild, bright clothing was the perfect way for a precocious and love-filled child to express herself. The fact that she still has that child-like sparkle in her eye even as an adult speaks to her lightness of being and joyous spirit.  It doesn’t get much better than the recreation of these gorgeous throwback photos. Her fairy tale childhood was definitely a unique experience, and these photos are a window into her singular experiences.  We can’t get enough of all the InStyle photos — even as a tiny kid Drew Barrymore had impeccable style.  What do we have to do to get that wild and fancy-free hair?  Who among us didn’t have a flower-embroidered bucket hat back in the day? Drew makes it look better than we ever could, TBH.  We have to admit that fancy-baby Drew Barrymore is our favorite.  This photo captures how surreal and fantasy-like her childhood really was. Drew looks so wise as her younger self — and even more so now. That inner beauty is just always shining through.

In E! Online‘s new sneak peek from an upcoming episode of Life of Kylie, the titular star admits that KarJenner family matriarch Kris Jenner can be a little intimidating.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I was scared of my mom growing up,” Kylie says. “She was really scary. She still is scary, but now we have more of a friendship.”  The admission is prompted by a battle between Kylie and her assistant, Victoria Villarroel, over who will be the one to tell Kris about the beauty mogul’s changing travel itinerary.  “So the plan was that we were all gonna fly together to Peru,” Victoria explains. “It was going to be a one-way easy flight and then I get a text from Kylie saying, ‘Actually, I’m gonna fly to Miami. Can you ask my mom if the plane can pick me up?’ ”  “This adds five hours of travel time to Kris Jenner’s flight,” Villarroel says. “No way. No way am I gonna ask your mom. Are you kidding? I was terrified of asking Kris.”  FROM COINAGE: The Lavish Lifestyle of the Kardashian Kids  Sunday’s Life of Kylie episode will also feature footage from the 20-year-old’s service trip to Peru, where she visited non-profit organization Smile Train, which provides support and corrective surgery for children in developing countries with cleft lips. Jenner’s own fundraising efforts for Smile Train paid for over 30 corrective surgeries during her visit alone.",

In 2007, she and her family began starring in the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Its success led to the creation of spin-offs including Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami [2] and Kourtney and Kim Take New York.[3]  With sisters Kim and Khloé, Kourtney is involved in the retail and fashion industries. They have launched several clothing collections and fragrances, and additionally released the book Kardashian Konfidential in 2010. Kourtney launched her own website called 'Poosh' in early 2019.  Kourtney and her siblings are popular on social media and endorse products such as waist slimming pants, beauty products, Coca-Cola and prescription drugs, for which they are paid (as of 2016) between $75,000 and $300,000 per post on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, as per CBC Marketplace.[4][5][6]  Early life  Kourtney Mary Kardashian was born in Los Angeles, California on April 18, 1979 to Robert and Kris.[7] She has two younger sisters, Kim and Khloé, and a younger brother, Robert (Rob).[8] In 1991, her parents got divorced and her mother married Bruce Jenner, a 1976 Summer Olympics decathlon winner (Jenner later changed her name to Caitlyn[a]) in 1991.[10] Through their marriage, Kardashian gained stepbrothers Burton \"Burt\", Brandon, and Brody; stepsister Casey; and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie.[11]  She attended Marymount High School, a Roman Catholic all-girls school in Los Angeles. Following graduation, she moved to Dallas, Texas, to attend Southern Methodist University for two years. Kourtney then lived in Tucson, Arizona, where she graduated from the University of Arizona with a bachelor's degree in Theatre Arts and a minor in Spanish. Her classmates included Nicole Richie and Luke Walton.[12] In 1994, her father garnered public attention as an additional defense lawyer for football player O.J. Simpson during his murder trial.  Career  Kardashian posing for GQ in 2018  Kourtney first became known to reality-television audiences on the 2005 series, Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive, on which she earned money for charity. In February 2007, a sex tape made by her sister Kim and former boyfriend Ray J in 2003, Kim Kardashian, Superstar, was leaked, which largely contributed to her rise to prominence.[13][14] Later that year, Kourtney, in addition to her mother Kris; her stepfather Bruce (now known as Caitlyn);[15] her siblings Kim, Khloé, and Rob; and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie were commissioned to star in the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians.[16] The series proved successful for E!, the network on which it is broadcast, and lead to several spin-offs, including Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami, Khloé & Lamar, and Kourtney and Kim Take New York .[17]  Kourtney and her mother opened children's clothing boutiques called Smooch in the Los Angeles area and New York City; the boutiques carry the brand Crib Rock Couture. With sisters Kim and Khloe, Kardashian co-owns and operates D-A-S-H, a clothing boutique in Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, and a pop-up store in the Hamptons.[12]  In the spring of 2010, Kourtney and her sisters released a clothing line for Bebe.[18][19][20] In August 2010, Kourtney announced that she and her sisters were working on another clothing line called K-Dash, sold on QVC.[21] Kardashian and her sisters created a sunless tanner called Kardashian Glamour Tan in 2010.[22] Kardashian wrote the book Kardashian Konfidential with her sisters Khloe and Kim; it was released in November 2010.[23]  Kourtney made her acting debut with a guest appearance on the ABC soap One Life to Live on March 28, 2011, appearing as attorney Kassandra Kavanaugh.[24] Kardashian, who had grown up watching the soap opera and described her appearance as the realization of a \"lifelong dream,\" had reservations about her acting debut, stating: \"I'd thought I'd only have two lines. But my script is so long... I'm not an actress.\"[25][26] Her performance was met with negative reviews from critics.[27] In November 2011 she released a novel Dollhouse along with sisters Khloe and Kim.[28]  In September 2012, she and younger sister Kim created another spinoff reality television series, Kourtney and Kim Take Miami, which began airing in January 2013. It features their mother Kris Jenner, Kourtney's boyfriend at the time, Scott Disick, and sister Khloé Kardashian.[29][30]  Kourtney, Khloé, and Kim were spokeswomen for the diet supplement Quick Trim, for weight loss. In March 2012 the three sisters were named in a $5 million class-action lawsuit against QuickTrim.[31] The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, accused the Kardashians, along with QuickTrim's manufacturer Windmill Health Products; the retailer GNC; and others in the sales and marketing chain, of false and deceptive marketi...",

However, while Jen, 49 and Ange, 42 both want to stake out their own territory, 'neither are willing to budge an inch,’ resulting in both ladies agreeing to do their best to avoid each other – something neither are very happy about.    'Why should either of them have to tiptoe around the Academy Awards worrying about bumping into the other?” continues the insider.    'A face-to-face showdown is inevitable.'  Not only that, Brad Pitt – who is now both Jen and Ange’s ex-husband - is said to be 'in a panic' over a potential public spat.

The myriad of matte and metallic shades look stunning, but the thought of getting a selection of them onto lids without looking like a child's art project gone wrong can scare people away from them entirely. Without the right blending, the shadows could end up looking muddy, splotchy, patchy, or harsh. Cringe. The word \"blending\" in and of itself freaks some people out. Trust and believe that there's nothing to be afraid of. Unlike those holographic snakes, eye shadow doesn't have fangs.  I asked a handful of professional makeup artists to demystify eye shadow blending, and I swear blending is easier than it looks with their tips. You don't have to be giving celebrities perfectly diffused smoky eyes all day and all night to master the technique.  Before you do anything, though, don't do anything at all. If you ask Patrick Ta, a professional makeup artist who's worked with Gigi Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski, your eye makeup should be applied before the rest of your makeup. \"I always say to do your eyes first to avoid fall-out from your eye shadows,\" Ta tells Allure. \"If you prefer to do your face first, you can use Shadow Shields to avoid this as well.\"  OK, now that we have that out of the way, here are five steps to eye shadow blending.  1. Prime for success.  If you're going to take the time out of your busy day to blend your shadow to perfection, you might as well smooth some eye shadow primer onto your lids to keep everything in place. Amy Strozzi, who's worked with Rowan Blanchard and Aly & AJ, tells Allure, \"I keep it closer to the lash line and fade it as I go upward so I have more flexibility to blend in the crease area.\" Then let it dry for at least 10 seconds before moving on to the main event.

        "text": "After hanging in limbo three years after they announced their split in June 2015, Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck's marriage has officially come to an end  After being in limbo for three years after announcing their split in June 2015, Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck‘s marriage has officially come to an end.  PEOPLE confirmed the two finalized their divorce on Thursday after they met at Garner’s house with lawyers and a private judge.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The finalization came one day after news broke the actress, 46, had requested a private judge to handle the final details of their divorce, according to court documents obtained by PEOPLE.  The estranged couple announced their separation after 10 years of marriage and three children together: Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6. Affleck, 46, and Garner began dating in 2004 and married in June 2005 before simultaneously filing for divorce in April 2017.  In the time between their split announcement and the divorce filing, the former couple presented a largely united front as they went through challenges together — namely, Affleck’s recent rehab stay. Garner showed her support by driving him to the treatment facility.  Here’s an inside look into the former couple’s ups and downs.  “The Love of My Life”  Six months after the former couple announced their split, Affleck was living in the guesthouse of their family home — something that seemed to begin taking a toll.  “It’s obvious many times that they both find it annoying to deal with each other,” an insider told PEOPLE at the time. “Understandably so. It’s a strange situation to live together and yet be separated.”  Image zoom Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck at the 2013 Academy Awards Jason Merritt/Getty  “They are doing what is working for the kids,” a Garner source noted of the living set-up.  For Affleck, keeping his mind on work apparently helped ease the pain of the separation. In September 2015, he was focusing on his directorial effort Live By Night and promoting Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. “He is happier and a more fulfilled person when he’s busy all day and night working,” a film source told PEOPLE. A source close to the actor added, “He is as happy as he can be in this position. I don’t think it’s that easy, and definitely not that easy to do it in the public eye.”  In February 2016, Garner opened up about the ongoing divorce in an interview with Vanity Fair. While the actress called Affleck “the love of my life,” she also opened up about their marital struggles, telling the magazine, “I always say, ‘When his sun shines on you, you feel it. But when the sun is shining elsewhere, it’s cold.’ He can cast quite a shadow.”  Affleck later told The New York Times, “She’s allowed to talk about it,” adding, “She felt like she wanted to discuss it and get it out there and get it over with so she could say, ‘Look, I already talked about it – I don’t want to do it again.’ ”  After celebrating Easter as a family in Los Angeles that year, Affleck and Garner spent a month in Europe with their kids while he filmed Justice League, including time in London and a family getaway to Paris. “She did have the best time in Europe with Ben and the kids,” a friend of Garner’s told PEOPLE. “She seemed to enjoy spending time with Ben again.”  Co-Parenting After Their Split  Garner and Affleck stayed close as they continued to live and vacation together as well as co-parent their kids — while also stepping out for solo outings. Shortly after announcing the separation, the entire family jetted off to the Bahamas to spend time together.  Image zoom Jennifer Garner with her three children, Seraphina, Violet and Samuel at her Walk of Fame Ceremony in August Vince Flores/Startraksphoto.com  The family reunited again the following month in Atlanta, Georgia, where Garner was filming Miracles from Heaven. Affleck traveled to the Southern state to celebrate his 43rd birthday with his ex and the kids. “He’s happiest when he’s with his family,” a close friend told PEOPLE at the time.  In September 2015, the pair were spotted leaving a family counseling center in L.A. This marked their first visit to the center since announcing their divorce. Before their decision to separate, they attended weekly counseling sessions at the center but stopped going in the months leading to their split.  A source said they chose to remain friendly for reasons beyond parenting. “It’s not just for the kids – it’s also for them,” said the source. “They care about each other.” As the family continued to step out as a unit, observers noticed that Affleck and Garner seem to be looking happier after a tumultuous summer. “His family is all [Ben] cares about. This is what makes him happy and it makes sense that he looks happier,” another source told PEOPLE. “He enjoys the time with his family and that includes Jen.”  Since then, the two have worked hard at maintaining a harmonious relationship for the sake of their chi...",

        "text": "“ No Troll left behind! „ ~ King Peppy  Peppy, also referred to as King Peppy, is the retired king of the Pop Trolls and Poppy’s father. He is a supporting character in Trolls and throughout the franchise.  Contents show]  Appearance  King Peppy is a orange troll who has pink hair, eyebrows and a moustache with grey streaks on them. He has a yellow nose and possibly brown eyes. He wears a green and blue waistcoat, and green pants. In one scene though he's seen wearing white boxers.  He often carries a walking stick which helps him walk, but doubles as a mic.  Personality  King Peppy is shown as a wise teacher in Trolls: The Beat Goes On! and has sage advice on things. Though he has his eccentric side as well. For example in the episode Royal Review, he gives his daughter a frowny face in the primary vote to teach her a lesson, though he isn't clear what the lesson was himself.  Relationships  Their relationship is generally one of great respect; Peppy is glad to have her as a daughter and Poppy looks to him for sage advice. Poppy admires her father and wants to be a good leader to the Trolls like he was, but sometimes just lacks the experience and Peppy is known to chip in advice from time to time.  H.U.G.G.  In Trolls: The Beat Goes On! Season 6 episode Hug Fest, Peppy joined with his former band H.U.G.G. which consists of Sky Toronto, Mags Gumdrop and Dr. Moonbloom.  Skills & Abilities  He has most normal Troll abilities.  Due to his aging body, he has physical restrictions.  Leadership  As a leader, Peppy was known for his strength of body and mind, matched by his determination and will to carry on. While how long his reign was is unknown as that information is unavailable, he was the King who successfully saved his people from Trollstice under the oath of \"no Troll left behind!\" on the day his daughter Princess Poppy was set to be devoured by King Gristle Jr.. It was also his duty to make new holidays, with \"Funsgiving\" being one of those holidays he declared.  Peppy, as a leader is to protect him people no matter what, but often he relies on the \"run and hide\" tactic, running and hiding from danger rather then face it.  Music  Peppy was a member of H.U.G.G. in the Season 6 episode Hug Fest as a lead singer.  When he was King of the Pop trolls, it was his sworn duty to protect his music, including the pink string of Pop.  Adventurer  It has been mentioned in Trolls: The Beat Goes On! that in his youth Peppy was highly adventurous and went on many great adventures, though few details of these adventures are known.  Teaching  When he was leader it would have been his duty to teach young Trolls about being a Troll. Now retired, he extends his knowledge to try and help his daughter with sage old advice. However, he hasn't necessarily revealed everything he knows to her, as evidence by his neglecting of telling her about other tribes until Queen Barb became a threat.  History  Pre-Trolls  Peppy became King some time before the Storyline, the circumstances of his rise to the throne is unknown and it is unknown who was before him or how he became King.  At some point in the past, either during or before his reign the Bergens came along after one of them ate a member of his Tribe. They built over time Bergen Town and started a tradition of once a year gathering around The Troll Tree to taste happiness. While it is unknown the death toll and numbers lost to the annual event, as only Grandma Rosiepuff had ever been named as one of their presumed victims.  Peppy was determined to free his people and 20 years before the main events of Trolls. On the last Trollstice, when his daughter Princess Poppy was due to be eaten by Prince Gristle, he freed the Trolls from Bergen Town and lead them to freedom.  They rebuilt their civilization deep within the forest away from the town. Despite the re-build, most of the previous culture of their Tribe had been lost and Peppy was the only one to remember the existence of other Tribes. Life would slowly return to normal for the Trolls and Peppy focused on rising his daughter and help rebuild what the Trolls had lost to the Bergens.  Trolls  20 years later Princess Poppy threw a party to celebrate her father's efforts. However, the loud party attracted the Bergen Chef who took The Snack Pack save Poppy. King Peppy, being too old to fight the Bergens, wanted to run away but Poppy insisted she went after her friends. Peppy tried to stop his daughter, but he refused much to his dismay.  He and the other Trolls hid in Branch's Survival Bunker (much to his dismay) while she went off to save her friends.  Later he hears his daughter's cowbell playind causing the other trolls and him to come out of higing, only to find Creek was the one playing it and as a consequence be captured by the Bergens lead by Chef.  At the Bergen Castle, the entire Troll village is thrown into a pot where he and Poppy are reunited. Poppy however is sad as her attempts to save her friends lead to the entire villa...",

A spokesperson for “The Wendy Williams Show” told Page Six on Wednesday morning that she was “experiencing flu-like symptoms,” and had decided to take the rest of the week off. Reruns are airing in place of live shows.  “I feel awful, I had to be talked out of going into work today, and taking off a few days to get myself together,” said Williams, calling herself a “thoroughbred” and referring to her days on the radio when she refused to take a sick day.  “I took the proper vacation time, but take off sick? What? No, never.”  An outpouring of support flooded in the comments of Williams’ video, while some fans were concerned for her health.  In October 2017, she suddenly collapsed on live TV. After a brief commercial break, she returned and said it “was not a stunt. I’m overheated in my costume and I did pass out. But you know what? I’m a champ and I’m back.”",

Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) took Hadid to the renowned Robot Restaurant, an extremely unconventional dinner theater experience featuring performers dressed as monsters, animals and yes, robots.  The “Call Out My Name” crooner shared a video on his Instagram Story featuring Hadid cracking up while watching the performance. It ended with one of the restaurant’s robot-costumed actors playfully taking a fall.  Although Tesfaye and Hadid called it quits in 2016, they began to be spotted out together again -- including a PDA-filled night in Cannes back in May -- not long after Selena Gomez and he broke things off in 2017.  As recently as July 2, both Hadid and Tesfaye shared strikingly similar photos, seemingly teasing that they were spending time together. In the singer’s Instagram photo, he looks out over a balcony at what appears to be his home in Hidden Hills, California. Hadid’s image appears to have been taken moments later and features the same view but from further back, and includes the home’s spacious pool.  Until the next time these two cross paths and decide to let their fans know...  Get more news on Hadid in the clip below.

However, the duo are believed to have been dating in secret since 2013, a year after Katie split from her husband Tom Cruise, who allegedly included a clause in the divorce settlement banning her from publicly dating for five years.  'Jamie and Katie's relationship is not a secret but they both like to keep it under the radar,' a Foxx source previously told PEOPLE.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  In the clip, first shared by E! News, Kardashian West is in the midst of a shopping trip with her friends and crew when an overwhelming crowd of fans and photographers begins to form at the entrance to the store.  “Honestly, I haven’t been shopping in months,” she says. “Not that I even need anything, but I always like to see what stores have in different countries, or if there are special pieces.”  As she browses the racks and picks out matching purses for her and daughter North West, 3, her friends begin to notice her unease.  “Are you nervous about that crowd?” asks hairstylist Jen Atkin.  “Yeah,” replies Kardashian West. “I just don’t know — I’m like, afraid of everything. I just get scared.”  RELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian West Breaks Down Over Paris Robbery Attack: ‘That Was So Meant to Happen to Me’  “This is what I was kind of afraid of — this feeling of panic,” she explains. “With so many people gathering, and then they start [posting on] social media, like, ‘Kim’s at the mall, she’s here,’ — and then other people will know exactly where I’m at. It gives me such anxiety.”  Luckily, the star and her entourage slip out a back door, averting a crisis and potential panic attack for Kardashian West.  At the time, a source told PEOPLE the reality star was “nervous” before she left for the trip, but ended up having “a great weekend.”  “It’s a work trip, but she has been sightseeing a bit as well,” said the source. “She was nervous before she left, but says it was the right decision. She was excited to spend time with her fans.”",

The wildlife warrior, 19, took to Instagram on Saturday to share an adorable couple photo with her boyfriend of four years.  However, upon uploading the image, Bindi was inundated with comments from fans all waiting for a wedding.  'Patiently waiting for the proposal': A photo shared by Bindi Irwin to Instagram on Saturday was inundated with comments from fans urging her to marry Chandler Powell (pictured)  Several followers referenced a wedding or proposal beneath the photo, which was taken during a sunset hike in Queensland's Glass House Mountains National Park.  One wrote: 'Every time you post a picture together I'm always sure it will be your engagement announcement. Wishful thinking!'  Another echoed a similar sentiment, commenting: 'Patiently waiting for the proposal photo.'  'Every day is so special with you': Bindi recently celebrated her anniversary with boyfriend Chandler in a loved-up social media tribute  One follower tagged Chandler directly, writing: '@chandlerpowell propose already, man! Come on!'  The engagement speculation comes after Bindi publicly celebrated her four-and-a-half year anniversary with Chandler earlier in the month.  'I have loved this guy since I first met him, over four and a half years ago. Every day is so special with you,' she cooed in the Instagram post.  True love: 'I have loved this guy since I first met him, over four and a half years ago,' the wildlife warrior wrote on Instagram  Chandler and Bindi met at Australia Zoo and have previously discussed the story of their fateful encounter.  'I'm a professional wakeboarder. I was there (Australia) for a wakeboard competition,' the American-born Chandler said on Dancing With The Stars in 2015.  'I thought it would be awesome to go visit Australia Zoo (owned by Bindi's family)... and she ended up giving me a tour and we ended up staying in touch ever since.'  Chance meeting: Chandler and Bindi met at Australia Zoo and have previously discussed the story of their fateful encounter  In an interview with US Weekly around the same time, Bindi recalled how much of a gentlemen Chandler was when he reached out to her.  'He tracked me down through the zoo and was like, \"If she doesn't want to stay in contact that's totally fine, but here's my e-mail.\"  'We stayed in touch and became great friends. I can't really say when it turned into more. It just evolved over time and bloomed into this wonderful thing.'",

The reality personas tied the knot this weekend in an intimate ceremony with family and friends in Puerto Vallerta, Mexico according to a Saturday report from Us Weekly.  Making it official! Bachelor In Paradise's Carly Waddell and Evan Bass tied the knot in an intimate ceremony this weekend. Above the pair are pictured in a June 15 Instagram  Series host Chris Harrison had the honors of officiating the ceremony while BiP alums Jade Roper and Tanner Tolbert were among the wedding's guests.  Carly and Evan are the only couple still going strong from last season of Paradise.  Couples Josh Murray and Amanda Stanton broke up in March while Grant Kemp and Lace Morris split last November.  Magic moment: Carly and Evan are the only couple from BiP's third season who are still together. Above you can see Evan pop the question during last season's finale of Paradise  Host with the most! Chris Harrison (above) had the honor of officiating the ceremony while BiP alums Jade and Tanner were also among the guests  Their nuptials will be broadcast during a special episode of the ABC dating show this summer.  And while Carly and Evan's wedding will still get the silver screen treatment, season four of Bachelor In Paradise is still in indefinite hiatus.  Last week the show's production came to a screeching halt after allegations of misconduct emerged following the first day of shooting on the steamy dating game.  Unclear future: While Carly and Evan's wedding will air on ABC during a special Bachelor broadcast, the fate of Bachelor In Paradise is up in the air following the emergency cancellation of season four  The scandal stems from a hookup between contestants Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson.  After the duo learned they would be paired together for a storyline on the partially-planned reality series, Corinne and DeMario embarked on a night of heavy drinking and hooking up which ended with Jackson publicly performing oral sex on his fellow contestant.  Although there were multiple witnesses to the drunken tryst on the first day of filming, a complaint was only filed after a producer raised serious concerns about Corinne's ability to consent after reviewing the footage from the previous day. Production was halted shortly thereafter.",

While she’s hard at work on her new seventh studio album, the singer said this period of her life is all about family.  “I’m just super excited about this time in my life,” Ciara told HarpersBazaar.com — for which she posed topless in a stunning bump photoshoot.",

But there was also, interestingly, a susceptibility when you were a child.\"  Henry reveals that the susceptibility has to do with some sort of infection or illness that affected Matlin's immune system.  With the help of her longtime interpreter Jack Jason, the actress confirms Henry's revelations: One of Matlin's family members always told her that her hearing impairment was a result of a fever that escalated during a flight she took when she was a child.",

        "text": "COUNTRY superstar Jason Aldean has been trolled for leaving the stage after shots were fired during his concert in Las Vegas.  Twitter users called Aldean a “coward” for rushing off the stage during the Route 91 Harvest Festival country music concert in Vegas without warning fans of impending danger.  “Jason Aldean ran off the stage not saying 1 words to the crowd to get out, like a coward ... really love the country eh?” @commanderinfunk wrote.  VEGAS MASSACRE: Worst shooting in US history  GUNMAN’S BROTHER: ‘He just snapped’  Glad @Jason_Aldean ran off the stage not saying 1 word to the crowd to get out, like a coward...really love the country eh Tex?#PrayForVegas — Jason (@CommanderinFunk) October 2, 2017  However social media was also filled with well wishes for Aldean and the victims of the tragedy, asking others to think what they’d do in the same situation.  Aldean, 40, has had 19 No. 1 on the US country charts and his last album They Don’t Know debuted at No. 5 on the Australian album chart last year.  He toured Australia for the first time in March last year, playing the CMC Rocks festival in Queensland.  Aldean wrote on Instagram “Tonight has been beyond horrific. I still don’t know what to say but wanted to let everyone know that me and my crew are safe. My thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved tonight. It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night.”  He added the hashtags #heartbroken and #stopthehate.  Aldean has two children and his wife is pregnant with their third.  RUSSELL BRAND LASHES OUT  The comments come after Russell Brand has blasted American gun laws and “normalised” mass shootings in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting tragedy.  “It’s interesting that America’s ideas about freedom to purchase arms continues to hold the imagination so strongly even after Sandy Hook,” Brand said, in a video he posted online today from the United States.  “It’s sort of tragic that as I’m looking at this, I’m not thinking, ‘What?! Fifty people have died?!’ Instead, it’s like ‘one of those things has happened.’ It is already normalised by virtue of the fact it happens a lot.”  The British comedian — who cancelled a scheduled TV appearance to promote his new book on the US Today show following the tragedy — also debated what drove the violence.  “What is it that’s bubbling up from under the surface in the form of violence of this kind?,” Brand said, in the video posted on his Facebook page.  “I would argue that it’s extreme unhappiness, extreme darkness, an unaddressed darkness.  “This social phenomena occurring this regularly and our ability to see it as kind of normal is an indication that we need to address the root cause, and the root cause is always the consciousness of human beings on an individual and social level.  “This won’t stop happening unless we change our mentality.”  MARIAH BLINDSIDED IN SHOCK INTERVIEW  Furious Good Morning Britain viewers have slammed the show’s “bizarre” and “inappropriate” interview with Mariah Carey as “tasteless” and “unfair” after the star was put on the spot about the horror shooting in Las Vegas.  The Hero singer was due to chat to presenters Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid about her new tour, and was perched on her sofa alongside her huge Christmas tree.  Yet the angle of their interview switched when news of the Las Vegas massacre broke, with Mariah unaware of the shooting.  Ahead of their chat, Piers, 52, explained Mariah knew the city “very well” after recently rounding off her music residency in the gambling hotspot.  He asked her about her instant reaction. Looking troubled, she said: “This is horrible. I pray for the victims.”  As Piers showed her live scenes of the terrifying situation unfolding, she was stunned into silence.  Finally, she added: “That’s awful. I pray for the victims. I hope all this can stop.”  Put on the spot, she continued: “This type of thing happening anyway is a huge tragedy. I hope we have an end to this as soon as possible.”  Viewers raged online at the awkward interview, with many criticising producers’ decision to quiz Mariah about the shooting.  “So tasteless breaking the Vegas news to Mariah Carey live on TV, shame on you,” one Twitter user wrote.  “Someone should have spoken to Mariah off air letting her know what was going on then postponed, instead of throwing that at her,” another wrote.  CELEBRITY REACTION  Several stars — many of whom have been regular performers in Las Vegas — took to Twitter to share their thoughts and prayers for those affected.  Horrified to hear about the shooting in #LasVegas. My thoughts are with the victims and their families.

These days, she’s enjoying the fruits of her labor, and it’s hard to imagine her as anything less than an A-lister. But it wasn’t that long ago that she was just another actress trying to catch a big break.  And when she finally landed her first starring role, it was in a place many fans might not expect.  1. Stone first started acting when she was a child  She’s come a long way since she first started acting. | Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images She’s come a long way since she first started acting. | Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images  Most of us don’t think of Stone as a child actor. But she was — at least, in her hometown’s community theater. Stone started acting when she was just 4 years old. And throughout her childhood, she was active in the Phoenix Valley Youth Theater program.  But when she was a teenager, she was ready for something more. And she knew how to get what she wanted.  Next: Stone used unconventional methods to convince her parents to let her be an actress.  2. She had a huge ambition  She always knew she could make it in Hollywood. | Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images She always knew she could make it in Hollywood. | Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images  By the time she became a teenager, Stone had taken years of voice lessons and appeared in more than a dozen community productions. She knew she wanted to try her hand at acting professionally.  But she had to convince her parents to let her move from Scottsdale, Arizona to Los Angeles first. Stone created a PowerPoint presentation called “Project Hollywood.” The presentation was designed to show her parents, in detail, what pursuing her dreams would entail. And she proved that she knew how to achieve them.  Next: Stone’s research paid off.  3. Stone got off to a shaky start in Hollywood  She wasn’t a well-known face here in 2006. | Mark Mainz/Getty Images She wasn’t a well-known face here in 2006. | Mark Mainz/Getty Images  At 15 years old, Stone moved to Los Angeles to implement the plan. And she wasted no time in trying to find her big break.  But it took her some time to make any headway. “I went up for every single show on the Disney Channel,” she said. “And auditioned to play the daughter on every single sitcom. I ended up getting none.”  Next: Stone’s non-stop auditioning yielded surprising results.  4. She didn’t let the rejection get her down  Like her La La Land character, Stone continued to pursue her dreams of stardom. | Summit Entertainment Like her La La Land character, Stone continued to pursue her dreams of stardom. | Summit Entertainment  Stone’s Hollywood project may not have gone to plan right away. But she didn’t let the litany of no’s deter her. Instead, she focused on her strengths — comedy and music — and kept auditioning. And within a few months, she found a path to fame, albeit through a slightly more unconventional route.  Before too long, she booked her television debut. She just had to jump through a few more hoops to get there.  Next: Emma Stone, reality star?  5. Stone’s TV debut wasn’t exactly what you’d expect for a future Oscar winner  Emma Stone on In Search of the Partridge Family | VH1 Emma Stone on In Search of the Partridge Family | VH1  In 2004, VH1 rebooted the classic ‘70s musical sitcom, The Partridge Family. And to drum up interest in the new series, they televised a reality competition to cast a new generation of actors in the iconic roles.  The up-and-coming actress — then going by her given name, Emily Stone — made the cut as one of the final contestants vying for the role of Laurie on In Search of The Partridge Family. Over the course of several episodes, she performed in acting and singing competitions designed to test her performance mettle.  She was a standout from the beginning, whether she was nailing her lines in Partridge Family-style skits or belting out ‘90s alt-rock classics like “Bitch.” And in the end, she won the role.  But her apparent big break didn’t last as long as she may have imagined.  Next: Stone’s star was on the rise – but for how long?  6. Her “Come On Get Happy” days did not last long  Little did she know she was headed for the big screen soon enough. | Screen Gems Little did she know she was headed for the big screen soon enough. | Screen Gems  The New Partridge Family wasn’t a hit. In fact, it was barely a blip on the radar. Only one episode, the pilot, was produced. And it aired with little fanfare on VH1 in January 2005.  Stone has spoken about her time on the reality series on multiple occasions. She told Vogue that she went in just thinking of it as another gig. But after several weeks, she admits, she just “really, really” wanted to win.  If Stone was disappointed that the series didn’t end up helping her in Hollywood, she didn’t have to wait for long for another chance to breakthrough.  Next: The end of the ...",

In a candid new interview with LOVE Magazine, the 22-year-old opened up about the reason for her absence from the runway in recent months.  This content is imported from {embed-name}. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  'Last season I didn't do any shows. Just ‘cause I was working in LA and I was like \"Oof, I can't right now - I'm gonna go crazy\",' she told the publication.  Instead, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star chose to stay at home and prioritise her health.  Though she did eventually return to the catwalk in June for Versace in Milan, she admitted: 'I was on the verge of a mental breakdown.'  MIGUEL MEDINA Getty Images  However, the model was quick to acknowledge how much she cherishes her family and career. 'I feel very, very blessed and I think that I live a very extraordinary life,' she gushed.  'I wouldn't change it for the world but there are days where I wish I could walk outside and nothing would be like it is right now.'  This content is imported from Instagram.

She’s the complete opposite &is the most generous,compassionate person I know! Her being standoffish is anxiety that paralyzes her which u take as rude! Only a despicable, entitled,unsympathetic,sadistic, uncharitable @self-absorbed human would write this tweet https://t.co/9Wwd9orILO — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) August 6, 2018  This isn't the first time the Victoria's Secret model has opened up about her 'debilitating anxiety'.  In an interview with Harper's Bazaar earlier this year, the Californian native admitted to BFF Cara Delevinge:  'I have such debilitating anxiety because of everything going on that I literally wake up in the middle of the night with full-on panic attacks. Where do I even start? Everything is so horrible, it’s hard to name one thing. I just think that the world needs so much love. I wish I had the power to send Cupid around the planet, as cheesy as that sounds.'  This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  To manage the 'crushing' pressure she faces as a social media star, Kendall has admitted she refuses to read comments.  'I think Instagram is still a fun place for the most part,' she added. 'I like going on and seeing what people are up to, but I mostly follow stupid accounts with pictures of puppies and little baby animals and people saving animals.  In January, Kendall's mother Kris Jenner discussed her daughter's on-going battle with anxiety after the supermodel was overheard calling her during an episode of the family's television show.  In a piece to camera, the 'momager' said: 'Kendall has anxiety, and I think she has so much going on that she gets herself really worked up.  'Kendall gets the most anxious during Fashion Week, so when she's traveling a lot and Milan's coming up and trying to juggle it all, [it's] overwhelming.'  Lat December, Jenner announced she would no longer be updating her app because she needed a break from social media.  We respect Kendall so much for sharing her battle with anxiety and putting her health first.

Conrad and her husband, Williams Tell, welcomed Liam, their first child together, on July 5. The pair announced their exciting news via Instagram that same day.  “He’s here! We’re so excited to welcome Liam James Tell into the world!” the former MTV star wrote alongside a picture of a cross-stitch that depicted her growing family.  He's here!

A post shared by Lauren Conrad (@laurenconrad) on Jul 5, 2017 at 6:09pm PDT  The happy couple revealed they were expecting their first bundle of joy via Instagram on New Year’s Day.  “Happy New Year!

A post shared by Lauren Conrad (@laurenconrad) on Mar 30, 2017 at 2:06pm PDT  The star, who announced in July that she was creating a maternity line called LC Lauren Conrad Maternity, opened up to WhoWhatWear last month about how motherhood has changed her personal style.  “I’m taking the pajama trend really literally,” the Laguna Beach alum told the publication. “I’m not really going into the office right now, so I’m wearing a lot of kimonos. But when I do leave, I actually dress up more because it feels like a special occasion for me … I’ve also tucked all my dry-clean-only pieces to the back of my closet.”  The best-selling author also mentioned that she has ditched stilettos for sneakers since turning 30. “I stopped wearing heels regularly. I wore heels a lot more regularly a few years ago. It’s just the realities of my job now. I run around a lot more. I’m on set a lot. I’m just tired of having sore feet … if I’m working and running around, I’m usually in tennis shoes. I do a Jack Purcell sneaker or a Chuck Taylor sneaker. I also have some ballet or almond-toe flats.”  Conrad and Tell, who had their first date on Valentine’s Day in 2012, married in September 2014.

Reports have surfaced suggesting that the pair, who reunited in 2017 after nearly five years apart that was plagued with reconciliation rumors, are taking some time for themselves.  On March 11, 2018, Us Weekly reported that multiple sources confirmed the news of their split.  Rumors are swirling about the reasons for Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber's recent breakup  In addition to various reports about Justin and Selena's breakup itself, a number of different theories about their reason for taking time apart have surfaced. None have been confirmed by either pop star, but that's done little to quell the chatter among their respective fan bases.  So why did Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez call it quits this time?  Selena Gomez's mom, Mandy Teefey  During their second go at love, countless outlets reported that Selena Gomez's mom, Mandy Teefey, was less than thrilled that her daughter had decided to give supposedly-reformed bad boy Justin Bieber another chance.  Those theories have picked up steam in the wake of their alleged split.  A source told Us Weekly: 'It's been hard for her because she is super close with her mom. Her mom was her rock when she was having her health complications.'  However, People magazine's sources have refuted these claims.  'They have their own issues and are always on and off. She wouldn't base her relationship off what her mom thinks,' a source said.  So apparently Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez are on a break and all I can picture Justin singing \"What Do You Mean?\" — Maddie (@maddie_harper99) March 14, 2018  Selena Gomez's family  It's not just Mandy that's not on board with the Biebs. According to Us, Selena Gomez's entire family had qualms about her and Justin Bieber getting back together.  The source said: 'Justin's family loves Selena, but Selena's family has put her in a very conflicting spot because they still don't trust Justin.  'Selena has tried to convince her family that Justin has changed...but her family just isn't budging right now.'  E! shared a similar report, claiming 'family pressure' and other issues led to their breakup.  'She's on a break with Justin partly because of family pressure but also because of some issues surrounding his birthday,' a source said.  'She wanted to have a quiet birthday celebration with Justin and he wanted to go big and involve all of his church friends. They had a disagreement that didn't end well.'  jelena is fine. they hate the media and are doing everything they can to avoid it. and there’s nothing wrong with that because they have nothing to prove to anyone. stop being so negative and good night �� — . (@biebsftlife) March 15, 2018  Justin Bieber's attitude  Amid rumors that Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber called it quits, Us reported that Justin's attitude may have been a contributing factor in the demise of their rekindled romance.  '[He] doesn't care about anyone but himself,' a source said.  'The second she saw it, she walked away, especially now with her health. She knows she doesn't need him.'  Infidelity  A rumor is swirling among Justin and Selena fans on Twitter that Justin was unfaithful to Selena. Some seem to believe the once-troubled singer had something going on with Petra Collins, whom Selena recently unfollowed on Instagram.  That rumor hasn't been substantiated, however. Especially considering it appears Petra is spending time with newly-single Justin Theroux.  They didn't break up  While many outlets are reporting that Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber have definitely decided to take some time apart, others claim they're still going strong.  Entertainment Tonight maintains the duo are still dating, but that Selena is taking a little time for herself to avoid outside pressure that stems from all the attention the two get.  A source said: 'Selena is very delicate; her \"comeback\" to the spotlight has been tough — especially with the interest in her personal life with Justin and her mother.  Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber spotted leaving the Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills, California together despite breakup rumors. pic.twitter.com/Ey7aHofjbT — Pop Crave (@PopCrave) March 8, 2018  'She is taking time to herself. This is not the first time she has done this.'  The insider added: 'She wants to repair her relationship with her mother, that's a priority for her, too. She needs to figure out how to live the life she wants in the spotlight — if that's even possible.'  This theory appears to be popular among fans of both Justin and Selena, who believe they're still together but are in hiding. Some tweeters seem to think the couple simply don't like the media circus surrounding their relationship, so they're laying low.  This theory does seemingly hold up, as both Justin and Selena have complained about paparazzi attention in the past.  Will Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber get back together?

You can also see what we’re up to by signing up here.  Warning: Major spoilers for both seasons of Stranger Things below! Proceed at your own risk.  If you spent last weekend binge-watching Stranger Things 2 instead of going to Halloween parties, you’re not alone. Buzz around the second installment of Netflix’s nostalgic sci-fi hit has been building steadily since last summer, leading some to question whether season 2 could possibly live up to the hype. But judging by the new episodes’ critical acclaim and record-breaking social media impact, it seems the Duffer brothers have done it again — and that includes the costumes.  “We definitely felt the pressure to make sure whatever we did was up to par,” says costume designer Kim Wilcox, who was tasked with taking over the sartorial world built by Kimberly Adams-Galligan and Malgosia Turzanska in season 1. Her first order of business? Brightening up the show’s wardrobe a bit.  “I wanted to infuse more of the colors of the early ’80s,” she says, “so while we kept a lot of that earthy palette — the tans and browns and blues — we also added in some pastels and slightly poppier colors. The tones are a little happier-looking.”  Even though the events of Stranger Things 2 are, for the most part, anything but happy. Below, Wilcox discusses Eleven’s Madonna-inspired punk makeover, Max’s California skater-girl style, the joys of dressing Bob, and much more.  What was your biggest costume challenge heading into Stranger Things 2?  Figuring out what Eleven would wear after the pink dress was something that the Duffers and I spent a lot of time thinking about. It’s such an iconic look that Kimberly created, and you see it in flashbacks throughout season 2.  When we first find her in Hopper’s (David Harbour) cabin, she’s watching television — [both] to learn the language and to learn about culture outside of the lab. She hasn’t been a normal child at all; her exposure to the world is through commercials and soaps. So at first, we were like, “Is she into the classic ’80s girly-girl looks? Would she wear something that felt really feminine?” But when we tried it on, it just felt forced.  [So I started thinking,] how would she have gotten her clothes? In my head, Hopper had been giving her clothes he already had in boxes in his cabin, and then maybe making a run to the next county to go to a thrift store and buy stuff for a boy, as a disguise. When we put all that together, it just made more sense to us. So that’s why Eleven looks the way she does for much of the season; nothing really fits well.  In episode 7, “The Lost Sister,” she gets a major makeover, though. How did you settle on the look for “punk Eleven?”  Well, she’s found this new group of people, and for the first time she can be open about her powers. We wanted her to become part of the gang, to absorb part of that look, to be this rougher person. So half of her costume is still made up of things she would’ve brought with her — her famous Converse, her socks, her jeans — but we felt that the top half would’ve been borrowed from the others, and that it’d be fun to combine a torn T-shirt with a tweedier element.  I was looking back to pictures of punks in the late ’70s and early ’80s, of photos of Siouxsie Sioux and Madonna in blazers with rolled-up sleeves. Madonna actually stole a lot of her looks from punk and made them her own; I remember going to thrift stores and buying 1960s blazers, rolling the sleeves and popping the collars. You’d put a bandana in your hair, and all of a sudden, you were Madonna!  I was thinking that the jacket might’ve been something they’d found in a warehouse, or stolen from somebody, and then gave to Eleven. The shoulders on the jacket give Millie a much bigger silhouette, too, and for this moment where she’s becoming a more powerful person, it felt appropriate that you’d see that in her silhouette. And wearing a bandana tied around your arm or your ankle as a badge was very popular at that time.  Is that blazer a vintage piece?  We knew we might need multiples, so we couldn’t use vintage. That’s the thing about working with vintage: You can find the perfect piece, but on a series like this where there’s a lot of action — and people are growing! — it gets really tricky. It’s very, very hard to find multiples of vintage clothing.  Nancy Wheeler’s amazing sweaters have to be vintage though, right? If not, I must know where to get them!  Unfortunately, those are mostly vintage one-offs that we were lucky enough to either rent or buy. But we actually created the green turtleneck she wears for a large portion of season 2 based off of a vintage piece. We were very lucky to find a similar fabric, because we needed about six multiples of that sweater. We made a lo...",

The 41-year-old Deadpool star responded to rumors about his marriage on Saturday, quoting a headline that he and Lively are “struggling to spend quality time together.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I wish,” Reynolds wrote on Twitter. “I could use a little ‘me time.’ ”  Reynolds’ joke comes a week after he and Lively, 30, walked the red carpet together at the New York City premiere of Final Portrait together, their first since the October screening of Lively’s All I See is You.  The busy working parents of two — to daughters James, 3, and Inez, 17 months — cozied up for the cameras and gazed into each other’s eyes while wearing matching black and white outfits.

Life just one year ago was a lot different for country music star Thomas Rhett and his wife Lauren Akins. The couple had no children— but that was all about to change when they would welcome their first daughter, Willa Gray, home from Uganda in May.  Having children is something the couple has dreamed about and asked God for and now that their dreams are coming true they take every minute to gush about their two bundles of joy. On the 2018 Grammy Awards Red Carpet the two couldn’t stop talking about their girls with E! News!  Thomas Rhett said that it has been “amazing” to watch Willa be a big sister to newborn Ada James.  “She was jealous at first I think, but it’s so fun to watch her,” Thomas Rhett said. “She loves our little Ada so much.”  “It’s something we just hoped for for so long,” Lauren spoke of her eldest daughter. “She was very fresh off just coming to America, so it was something that we really wanted her to feel comfortable.”  Willa has become more comfortable with her little sister for sure! The video of the two of them meeting for the first time is heartbreakingly adorable!  “I think I was more nervous that she just wouldn’t feel comfortable but the second I was like, ‘Do you wanna give her a kiss?’ and she leaned over and kissed [Ada], I was like, ‘Thank you God,’” Lauren added on the 2018 Grammy Awards Red Carpet. “It couldn’t be sweeter.”  Having Willa become an official member of the family wasn’t easy though. TR and Lauren also opened up about the emotional aspect it took to officially call her their daughter.  “It is definitely the hardest thing we’ve ever been through,” Lauren shared with E! News. “But I think it needs to be hard because you have to fight for that baby just like you do. I’ve done both now — I’ve had one biological and I’ve had one through adoption. It’s a battle to bring your child home. And it just strengthens you as parents and as a team. It is hard but it’s so worth it.”  Since Willa Gray has been home the whole Akins clan has just been enjoying life together and accomplishing many milestones. From Willa Gray’s first birthday with her family to Christmas as a family of four, they’ve done it all and with big smiles on their faces!

        "text": "The marriage between Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston really is over.  On Thursday night, the actor and actress released a joint statement confirming that they were going their separate ways after two years as husband and wife.  Before delving into various details concerning this stunning break-up, let's take another look at this statement.  It reads as follows:  In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation.  This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.  Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly.  Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative.  Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.  While this news took us by surprise, many tabloids have actually been calling it for months.  Before the Aniston-Brad Pitt reconciliation rumors start in earnest (What? It's too late for that?), we figured we'd go deep into this likely divorce.  What brought it about? How did Aniston and Theroux try to salvage their romance? Where does each go from here?  This is what we've been able to dig up thus far, courtesy of various outlets on the Internet...  Us Weekly: To kick off 2018, Anison and Theroux took a vacation in Cabo San Lucas with Jason Bateman and his wife, Amanda Anka.  According to magazine insiders, Amanda had been trying to work as a \"mediator\" between Aniston and Theroux for months, hoping to help them iron out all problems.  She talked Justin into going on this vacation.  “The Cabo trip was a make or break vacation for Jen and Justin,\" writes Us Weekly. \"They went away with their friends hoping to have fun and work on it.”  Alas, the plan failed, this source laments, saying the guys simply hung out together and the women hung out together.  Radar Online: But what caused the actual tension between the stars that prompted this trip in the first place?  Both Entertainment Tonight and Radar cite distance as a key factor.  Theroux spent more of his time in New York for work and Aniston in Los Angeles. In some ways, it was as simple as this.  After spending about two months apart toward the end of last year, an anonymous insider tells this website that the pair had a major argument in their Bel-Air mansion on December 14.  Shortly after this blow-up, Radar alleges Aniston started to \"lean hard\" on ex-boyfriend Gerard Butler, stirring up further jealousy and animosity between her and her husband.  It didn't help, meanwhile, that Theroux is known as a \"flirt\" when it comes to his co-stars.  Entertainment Tonight: It wasn't mere distance that drove Aniston and Theroux apart, it was how much he loved New York and how much she hated it there.  Sources tell this outlet that paparazzi attention was a major source of contention for them in The Big Apple.  \"It made for an awkward living situation for Jen and Justin because they knew the neighbors weren't happy\" about all the reporters outside their building at all times, ET writes.  \"The tension came to a head in what the source refers to as \"the bologna incident,\" explains one insider, who says Theroux once came downstairs to find that someone had covered his motorcycle in slices of bologna.  For real! Reportedly!  Aniston thought it was one of their neighbors who did it.  Aniston and Theroux do not have any children, which makes their split less messy.  Multiple outlets also confirm they do have an iron-clad prenuptial agreement.  Jennifer is the mega rich star between the tandem, considering all the money she has banked from Friends, and Us Weekly writes that these assets are well \"protected.\"  The estranged couple started to date in 2011 and got married in May of 2015.  We still can't believe they're over.  And we also can't believe Aniston will soon be back together with Pitt! You know it's happening!",

        "text": "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story type Movie  Over the years, there have been dozens of sports movies pitting the lovable underdogs against the seemingly unbeatable elites — it’s a classic American story. But none were perhaps as big of a surprise hit as 2004’s Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, the film starred Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller as, respectively, the underdog owner of failing gym Average Joe’s and the elite fitness guru trying to push the facility out of business. Backed by a wide and deep cast that also featured Justin Long as a male cheerleader, Alan Tudyk as a 24-7 pirate cosplayer, Rip Torn as a weathered old dodgeball coach, Christine Taylor as an athletically gifted lawyer, and more, Dodgeball was a surprise hit that summer, earning $167 million worldwide on a reported $20 million budget.  And while a long-discussed sequel to the film has never materialized, Dodgeball fans scored the next best thing on Wednesday morning when Omaze launched a new charity campaign with a video that reunites the original cast. The clip, seen above, stars Stiller as Globo Gym chief White Goodman, who’s back to implore viewers to team up with him in Omaze’s new contest. But, lo and behold, Vaughn’s Peter LaFleur is on hand too, along with Long and Taylor, to represent the Average Joe’s. Hilarity ensues and so does a request: Fans are encouraged to pick a side by signing up via Omaze’s website (either omaze.com/globo or omaze.com/joes) for the chance to play dodgeball with Stiller himself. Proceeds will benefit the Stiller Foundation, which supports education initiatives for children around the world.  EW talked with Stiller about filming the new video and looking back on the “true underdog story,” 13 years later.  Image zoom Omaze  ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: What did it feel like to step back into the White Goodman shoes?  BEN STILLER: It was really strange and fun. I didn’t know what it would be like, because I was away from it for so long and I never really thought there would be any reason to do the character again, but then when this opportunity came up, especially talking to Omaze and what good ideas for fundraising there would be, over the years we’ve been aware of people who are fans of the movie and their connection with it, which I’ve appreciated. It’s fun to connect with people on something like that — like at Halloween, I see people dressed up as the movie and things like that. To me, it was really important when we said we could do it, the first person I called was Rawson Thurber, who wrote and directed the movie, and said, “Hey would you get on board with this thing? If you would write and direct this thing, we could put the band back together.” That was the key to it, these things don’t exist in a vacuum in terms of the writing and situation. Once Rawson said yes, I called Vince up, and he immediately said, “I’m in, let’s do it, it’s for a good cause.” Then we got Justin Long and Christine Taylor and Missi Pyle and everybody; it was really exciting for us all to get back together. So we got our Halloween costumes, and luckily it’s Spandex so it all still kind of fit.  Are these new costumes?  We found the original costumes, literally the original mustache, and wig, this ratty old caterpillar of a mustache. Then it was one of those things where it came back, in terms of the dynamic. I think Rawson wrote a great little piece, it was really fun. We were in a gym and shooting, so it was a very similar situation to when we did the movie except all these years have gone by. So it was kind of bizarre yet fun, but also weird and eerie how everything came back, like Vince’s reactions and our whole dynamic. The dynamic is important when you’re doing a character like White because the whole thing is based on the dynamic of them playing off each other. That was really fun to jump back in.  Where did you come up with the character for White?  I honestly don’t know. It all kind of comes from the Tony Robbins impression that I tried to do on The Ben Stiller Show, and then it became Tony Perkis from Heavyweights [whom Stiller played] and then it morphed into White Goodman. I don’t have that many moves, really. It’s funny because once you do the makeup and get the wig on, then you’re suddenly like, “Oh yeah, I got this.” But I did watch a couple YouTube clips from the movie to reacquaint myself with what I was doing.  The original movie is so rich with one-liners and little absurdities. Are there things even you forget about and then get reminded of by fans?  Oh yeah. I don’t go back and rewatch the movie a lot unless I’m flipping across the channels and something comes up and I’ll watch for a second. So some of those lines from the movie I remember really well, and then other ones not as well, so it’s funny when people love a very specific thing. “Nobody makes me bleed my own blood” is one that has always kinda stuck with me. In terms of what people respond to, it’s always interestin...",

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “There was a bite, yes,” Teigen said in response to Tiffany Haddish‘s viral account of what went down at a party in December. “Listen, I think we’ve all done things under the influence.”  The expectant mom refused to give any more details, even admitting that it was hard to keep quiet.  “It’s not who I thought, I will say,” Teigen said. “The problem is I love everybody involved so I’m like zip. You know I share everything. It’s you guys! It’s so hard.”  Teigen also joked that she understood why the situation went down and even had to double check with husband John Legend that it wasn’t actually her.  “If I had a dollar for every time that I had a few glasses of wine or something and would have done something like that? Oh man, very rich,” Teigen joked. “I asked John yesterday, I was like ‘It’s not me, is it?’”  RELATED: Tiffany Haddish Reveals Beyoncé Stepped In When an Actress Got Too Close to JAY-Z  Teigen tweeted on Monday that she knows the unnamed actress who Haddish claims bit the “Lemonade” singer in the face at an after-party for JAY-Z back in December.  “I cannot leave this planet without knowing who bit Beyonce in the face,” she tweeted. “I can only think of one person who would do this. but I cannot say. but she….is the worst.”  Haddish, 38, who was at the event where the incident supposedly took place, revealed her version of the story in a recent interview with GQ.  “Beyoncé stormed away…went up to JAY-Z, and was like, ‘Jay! Come here! This bitch—’ and snatched him. They went to the back of the room. I was like, ‘What just happened?’ And Beyoncé’s friend walked up and was like, ‘Can you believe this bitch just bit Beyoncé?’” Haddish said.  Beyoncé’s representative, Yvette Noel-Schure, responded to the claim by telling GQ, “I absolutely cannot comment on any of this, as I have no knowledge.”  The comedienne wouldn’t name Queen Bey’s attacker but said that wasn’t the end of their dealings that night. Haddish said the actress later told her to stop dancing, so the funny lady gave Beyoncé a heads up that she wasn’t afraid to scuffle.  “I’m going to beat somebody ass at your party. I just want to let you know that,” Haddish claimed she told Beyoncé. However, the singer told her to forget about it and “have fun,” Haddish said, leading to their selfie to cool down tension.  She added, “Near the end of the party, Beyoncé’s at the bar, so I said to Beyoncé, ‘Did she really bite you?’ She was like, ‘Yeah.’ I was like, ‘She gonna get her ass beat tonight.’ ”",

        "text": "American actor and songwriter  Lin-Manuel Miranda ( ; born January 16, 1980)[1] is an American composer, lyricist, singer, rapper, actor, producer, and playwright, widely known for creating and starring in the Broadway musicals In the Heights and Hamilton. His awards include a Pulitzer Prize, three Tony Awards, three Grammy Awards, an Emmy Award, a MacArthur Fellowship, and a Kennedy Center Honor in 2018.  Miranda wrote the music and lyrics for the 2008 Broadway musical In the Heights. The stage musical has been made into a film, also titled In the Heights, which is scheduled to be released in June 2021.[2] His work won the Tony Award for Best Original Score,[3] the show's cast album won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album,[4] and the show won the Tony Award for Best Musical. Miranda was also nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for his lead role. He gained wider recognition for writing the script, music and lyrics for Hamilton, which has been acclaimed as a pop culture phenomenon since its Broadway premiere in 2015.[5] The show earned the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album, and was nominated for a record-setting 16 Tony Awards, of which it won 11, including Best Musical, Best Original Score and Best Book. For portraying the titular role, Miranda was nominated for another Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. The Hamilton cast recording spent ten weeks atop Billboard's Top Rap Albums chart in 2015, and was eventually named by Billboard as the eleventh-biggest album of the 2010s.[6] The Hamilton Mixtape, an album of covers of songs from the musical, developed by and featuring Miranda, reached number one on the Billboard 200.  Miranda's television work includes recurring roles on The Electric Company (2009–2010) and Do No Harm (2013). He hosted Saturday Night Live for the first time in 2016 and earned his first Emmy award nomination for acting. Among other film work, Miranda contributed music and vocals for a scene in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015); wrote music and songs in the animated musical Moana (2016), which gained him nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and the Academy Award for Best Original Song, for the song \"How Far I'll Go\"; and starred as Jack in the musical fantasy Mary Poppins Returns (2018), for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.  Miranda has been politically active, most notably on behalf of Puerto Rico.[7] He met with politicians in 2016 to speak out in favor of debt relief for Puerto Rico,[7] and raised funds for rescue efforts and disaster relief after Hurricane Maria struck the island in 2017.[8]  Early life [ edit ]  Miranda was born in New York City[1] and raised in the neighborhood of Inwood, the son of Dr. Luz Towns-Miranda, a clinical psychologist, and Luis A. Miranda, Jr., a Democratic Party consultant who advised New York City mayor Ed Koch.[9][10][11][12] Miranda has one older sister, Luz, who is the chief financial officer of the MirRam Group.[13] During childhood and his teens, he spent at least one month each year with his grandparents in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico.[14][15] He is of mostly Puerto Rican descent. His mother's ancestors include an interracial couple, Sophie, who was black, and David Towns, who was white; from the early 1800s, this couple spent their married life trying to outrun slavery as laws and governments changed around them. Ensuing branches of the Towns family primarily married Mexican spouses in Texas and Mexico, and Miranda, for his part, has described his ancestry as a quarter Mexican.[11][16][17] The name \"Lin-Manuel\" was inspired by a poem about the Vietnam War, Nana roja para mi hijo Lin Manuel, by the Puerto Rican writer José Manuel Torres Santiago.[18][19]  Miranda attended Hunter College Elementary School and Hunter College High School,[20] where his classmates included journalist Chris Hayes, who was Miranda's first director when the latter starred in a school play described by Hayes as \"a 20-minute musical that featured a maniacal fetal pig in a nightmare that [Miranda] had cut up in biology class\",[21] and rapper Immortal Technique, who bullied Miranda during high school, although the two later became friends.[22][23] It was during high school that Miranda began writing musicals.[24]  As a student, Miranda wrote the earliest draft of what would become his first Broadway musical, In the Heights, in 1999, his sophomore year of college at Wesleyan University.[24] After the show was accepted by Wesleyan's student theater company, Second Stage, Miranda added freestyle rap and salsa numbers, and the show was premiered there in 1999.[15] Miranda wrote and directed several other musicals at Wesleyan, and acted in many other productions, ranging from musicals to Shakespeare. He graduated from Wesleyan in 2002.[15][25]  Career [ edit ]  2002–10: In the Heights [ edit ]  In 2002, Miranda and Joh...",

Harry's American fiancee, who recently quit her acting career and is best known for her past role on \"Suits,\" spent the Christmas holiday with royal family for the first time, more than a month after they announced their engagement.  \"It was fantastic. She really enjoyed it. The family loved having her there,\" Harry said on BBC Radio 4's Today program on Wednesday, after the airing of his interview with former U.S. President Barack Obama and the prince's father, Prince Charles.  Markle is the first royal fiancee to celebrate the holiday with Harry's family. She joined them at Buckingham Palace to attend Queen Elizabeth II's pre-Christmas lunch. On Christmas Day, she joined them for their traditional holiday service at the Queen's Sandringham estate. Markle and Harry greeted fans and were photographed with Harry's brother Prince William and pregnant sister-in-law, Duchess Catherine. The group stayed at their home and spent time with William and Catherine's children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte.  \"[With] the family part of Christmas, there's always that work element as well and I think together, we had an amazing time, we had great fun staying with my brother and sister-in-law and running around with the kids,\" Harry said.  He also said he had to explain \"plenty\" of family traditions to his fiancee, adding, \"I think we've got one of the biggest families that I know of and every family is complex as well. She's done an absolutely amazing job, she's getting in there and it's the family that I suppose she never had.\"  A Look Back at Meghan Markle's Pre-Royal Life  During the post-interview chat, Harry was also asked if Obama was invited to his and Markle's wedding. The two are set to marry in May.  \"I don't know about that,\" Harry said. \"That's- we haven't put the invites or the guest list together yet, so who knows whether he's going to be invited or not. I wouldn't want to ruin that surprise.\"",

Although Kardashian West publicly supported Jenner’s journey, she cut ties after reading her book, which alleged Kris Jenner — Caitlyn’s ex-wife and Kim’s mom — knew more about her gender identity crisis than she’s admitted.  In an episode of KUWTK, the KKW Beauty mogul also revealed that she had been hurt by a chapter in the memoir in which Jenner implied that her late father Robert Kardashian thought his friend O.J. Simpson was guilty of having killed wife Nicole Brown Simpson and waiter Ron Goldman — despite having served as the NFL star’s defense attorney in his 1994 murder trial.  “My relationship with Caitlyn was strained,” the mother of three said during the episode, which aired October of last year. “I was just trying to be respectful. But if you talk about my dad, I will cut you.”  Despite their estrangement, in April of last year Kardashian West told Ellen Degeneres that she would “always love her” for helping raise her and her sisters.",

        "text": "In honor of their 70th wedding anniversary, the royal palace released new portraits of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip this week, showing the long-lasting couple ahead of their landmark milestone.  Taken by British portrait photographer Matt Holyoak, the images show the couple in the White Drawing Room at Windsor Castle. The Queen, 91, wears a yellow gold broach that Philip, 96, gave her decades ago in 1966, according to People.  The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh wed exactly 70 years ago on Nov. 20, 1947, when she was 21 and he was 26. The ceremony took place at Westminster Abbey — the coveted spot for marriages in the Royal Family. The Queen’s parents King George VI and Queen Elizabeth wed there in April 1932, and Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, had their ceremony there in 2011. (Queen Elizabeth was the 10th member of the Royal Family to be married there, according to The Royal Family’s official website.)  A handout photo shows Britain's Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip in the White Drawing Room at Windsor Castle in early November, pictured against a platinum-textured backdrop, in celebration of their platinum wedding anniversary on November 20, 2017. Matt Holyoak/CameraPress/PA Wire/Handout via REUTERS Matt Holyoak—CameraPress/PA Wire/Reuters  Two thousand guests attended their ceremony, which was broadcast to millions worldwide by BBC Radio. Then-Princess Elizabeth wore a gown — decorated with crystals and 10,000 seed pearls — designed by Sir Norman Hartnell, according to the Royal Family.  Six years later, the Queen returned to Westminster Abbey for her coronation after the death of her father, King George VI.  In addition to being the world’s longest-reigning monarch, Queen Elizabeth is now the first to have a platinum wedding anniversary. Since they wed, the couple has had four children, eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.  The Royal Family celebrated the landmark event this year at a private family event at Windsor Castle, according to People. During their 50th wedding anniversary in 1997, the Queen reflected on their decades of marriage, what Britain had been through since then and the placement of their wedding in history — just after World War II.  “What a remarkable fifty years they have been: for the world, for the Commonwealth and for Britain,” the Queen said in 1997. “Think what we would have missed if we had never heard the Beatles or seen Margot Fonteyn dance: never have watched television, used a mobile telephone or surfed the Net (or, to be honest, listened to other people talking about surfing the Net).”  And for words about her husband?  “He is someone who doesn’t take easily to compliments but he has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years, and I, and his whole family, and this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim, or we shall ever know,” she said.

        "text": "Luke Skywalker is back in The Last Jedi – and it’s a triumphant return. The Star Wars actor recalls the shock of finding out about Fisher and Harrison Ford’s secret affair and the pain of losing his longtime friend  Han Solo is dead and Princess Leia, heartbreakingly, died almost a year ago, when Carrie Fisher died after becoming ill on a flight from London, as she was going home for Christmas. Which means, out of the original Star Wars trio, the most holy of cinematic trinities, Luke Skywalker is the last one standing. This is not how anyone expected it to end, least of all Luke himself, Mark Hamill. So, while the latest entry in the Star Wars canon, The Last Jedi, written and directed by Rian Johnson, is great fun – as exciting and inspired as its predecessor, JJ Abrams’ The Force Awakens, but a lot funnier and without all the heavy-lifting of exposition and character setup that Abrams’s film had to cram in – it is also very poignant.  No one could have foreseen Fisher’s death and, in fact, she was going to be the centre of the next movie, just as Ford was the heart of The Force Awakens, and The Last Jedi is very much Hamill’s film. But there are moments in this movie that feel, in retrospect, breathtakingly prescient. The scenes between Luke and Leia after their long separation made my throat catch. I cannot imagine what it must be like for Hamill to watch them, his last on-screen moments with the woman who, for 40 years, was his on-screen sister and his off-screen friend.  “It’s devastating and I still haven’t come to terms with it,” he says, when we meet in a hotel in central London, hours before the UK premiere. “Gosh darn it, I still think of her in the present tense, you know? If she were here right now, she’d be behind you giving you bunny ears and me the middle finger because she was all about having fun all the time. Whenever I was on set, I would go straight to her trailer with my dog and hang out with her and her dog.”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hamill with Carrie Fisher in the first Star Wars film in 1977. Photograph: Pi/Rex/Shutterstock  Hamill and Fisher bonded almost instantly when they met, after being cast in Star Wars, and Hamill suggested the two of them go out for supper to get to “know each other a bit”. Within 10 minutes, Fisher, who would become one of Hollywood’s consummate memoirists, was telling him such intimate details about her father Eddie Fisher’s infamous affair with Elizabeth Taylor that Hamill felt the hairs on his arms stand up.  Shortly before she died, Fisher published her memoir about making the Star Wars movies, in which she revealed that she had had an intense and rather tragic affair with Ford, when she was 19 and riddled with insecurities, and he was 33 and married. Did Hamill know what was going on?  “Marcia [Lucas, Star Wars’ editor and George Lucas’s then wife] told me after we finished filming. I’m glad I didn’t know before, as it probably really would have affected me. By the time I found out, I just thought it was hilarious. But you know men – even if we don’t want to have a relationship, it’s just in our nature to jockey for affection,” he says.  But it sounds like there was some jockeying going on anyway, even if neither of the men was aware of the game. It turns out that Fisher kept one last secret.  “Carrie and I were attracted to one another, but I knew from previous jobs that it would have been a bad idea [to get involved with someone on set]. But Carrie and I found pretexts. I remember one time – I’m sure alcohol was involved – we were talking about kissing techniques. I said: ‘Well, I think I’m a fairly good kisser. I like to let the women come to me rather than be aggressive.’ And she said: ‘What do you mean?’ Well, next thing you know we’re making out like teenagers!”  Wait a minute. Luke and Leia – got it on? During the filming of the first Star Wars?  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hamill as Luke Skywalker in the latest in the canon, Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Photograph: John Wilson/AP  “Oh, yeah! Are you kidding me? We were all over each other!” he cackles. “But the one thing that drew Carrie and me back from the precipice was we kind of became aware of what we were doing and just burst out laughing. Which was unfortunate for me because the rocket launch sequence had been initiated,” he grins. And just like that, I spit my water all over Luke Skywalker’s knee.  Whereas in his 70s youth, Hamill, who was born and raised in California, was bright-eyed and blond, like Björn Borg’s earnest younger brother, he now has a handsome grizzle to him, with a rather endearing paunch. He is a little shambly and a lot rambly, and where he once looked callow, he now looks kind. Which he is, urging me to have the comfortable armchair while he takes the desk chair and sweetly encouraging my hackneyed Star Wars analogies about Donald Trump and Darth Vader, all of which he must have heard a million times before. (Hamill is a very vocal Trump critic, a fighter in the re...",
